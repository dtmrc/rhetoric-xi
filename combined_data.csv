"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021","On January 2, 2019, at an event commemorating the 40th anniversary of issuing the Message to Taiwan Compatriots, General Secretary Xi Jinping for the first time specifically discussed exploring the “two systems” Taiwan formula and enriching the practice of peaceful reunification, revealing the great practical significance of exploring the “one country, two systems” Taiwan formula in the new era, and directly propelling the theoretical exploration of the “one country, two systems” Taiwan formula to a new stage. Guided by this, academic research on the “one country, two systems” (1C2S) Taiwan formula must adapt to the new situation to achieve a transition from research on the 1C2S Taiwan model to exploration of the 1C2S Taiwan formula. There is also an urgent need to expand the breadth and depth of research content, so as to provide adequate intellectual support for the design and implementation of the “two systems” Taiwan formula. Before deepening the academic research on the 1C2S Taiwan formula and exploring the formula’s specific design, it is necessary to conduct a systematic review and analysis of the existing academic research on the 1C2S Taiwan formula, to get a clear picture of the progress, characteristics, and shortcomings of related research in the process of going from studying the 1C2S model for solving the Taiwan issue to exploring the “two systems” Taiwan formula."

"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021","Since the idea of “one country, two systems” was first proposed in the early 1980s, mainland scholars have begun to research and explore the 1C2S principle for solving the Taiwan issue, and have made many achievements in the exploration of the 1C2S Taiwan model. Overall, the focus has mainly been on the following five topics."

"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021","“One country, two systems” was originally proposed in order to peacefully resolve the Taiwan issue. When Deng Xiaoping first proposed the 1C2S concept, its content was more tailored to the Taiwan issue. That is to say, the initial concept of “one country, two systems” established the basic ideological framework of the 1C2S Taiwan formula. In consequence, to examine the ideological origins of the 1C2S Taiwan formula is actually to delve into the ideological origins of “one country, two systems.” On the whole, current academic exploration of the ideological origins of the 1C2S Taiwan formula is comprised mainly of three types."
"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021","1. The “one country, two systems” Taiwan formula originated in the thinking of first-generation leaders such as Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai on the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. Although 1C2S was a creative idea first proposed by comrade Deng Xiaoping, many scholars maintain that the relevant thinking on Taiwan of leaders like Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai was an important inspiration for Deng Xiaoping’s proposal of 1C2S. Li Jiaquan, after conducting a comparative analysis of the strategic thinking of three generations of CCP leaders on unifying China, points out that Deng Xiaoping, “as the Party’s General Secretary at that time, was also a direct participant in and formulator of the peaceful reunification idea of the ‘four principles [on Taiwan]’.” His proposal of the general principle of “peaceful reunification and one country, two systems” after the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, was an inheritance and development of the idea of peaceful reunification proposed by first-generation leaders Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai.1 Xie Chuntao believes that although Mao’s idea of the peaceful liberation of Taiwan was somewhat incomplete and could not be very effective under the historical conditions at that time, it provided a useful reference for Deng Xiaoping’s proposal of the “one country, two systems” concept following the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee.2"
"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021","2. The “one country, two systems” Taiwan formula is rooted in deep traditional Chinese history and culture. Some scholars believe that 1C2S, as a kind of theoretical concept with Chinese characteristics, necessarily has its own special basis in Chinese history and culture. On this point, Fei Xiaotong has remarked that 1C2S does not only have political significance. “When you go a step further to look at its origins, there is a Chinese cultural essence in it. It can combine different things together. Without this kind of an essence, we would not have today’s Chinese nation or Chinese culture, and 1C2S would not have emerged.”3 According to Li Daoxiang’s analysis, in terms of theoretical model, the theory of 1C2S is closely related to the traditional Chinese cosmological model of “one divides into two”; in terms of thought, it contains traditional Chinese culture’s spirit of pursuing unity, longing for peace, and seeking harmony without sameness; and in terms of values, it embodies the core values of the Chinese nation.4 Kong Xiangwen argued that 1C2S not only embodies the contemporary value of a political culture that is traditionally one of “pluralistic unity” in nature, but also embodies the spirit of Chinese harmonious culture and people-oriented thought.5 In addition, there are scholars who have taken pains to sort through and analyze the implementation of the official system in the north and south of the Liao Dynasty, the earliest 1C2S-like situation in Chinese history.6"
"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021","3. Lenin’s thinking on “peaceful coexistence” provided important theoretical inspiration for “one country, two systems.” Starting from Lenin’s thinking on the long-term peaceful coexistence of countries with two different systems, capitalism and socialism, some scholars believe that 1C2S is a flexible application and development of “peaceful coexistence.” Zhou Chunyuan has explicitly argued that the direct source of thought of 1C2S is Lenin’s idea of peaceful coexistence, which Deng Xiaoping applied specifically to issues of domestic relations in the process of peaceful reunification, based on the development realities of Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.7 Wang Zhongren has also argued that Deng Xiaoping broke beyond Lenin’s traditional way of thinking, which used the idea of “peaceful coexistence” to deal with interstate relations, and applied it skillfully to deal with China’s internal issue of unification. Thus the great concept of “one country, two systems” was created.8"
"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021","In addition to the above three types, there have also been a small proportion of scholars who have variously examined the origins of the 1C2S concept from a scattering of perspectives, such as the “Tibet model” in the early years after the PRC’s establishment, and the coexistence of different systems in world history."
"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021","ii. On the basic content of the “one country, two systems” Taiwan formula"
"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021","As one of the core components of “one country, two systems,” the 1C2S Taiwan formula contains two layers of meaning: the first is the general connotation, which is the basic connotation of 1C2S. Based on Deng Xiaoping’s original concept, the general consensus in academia regarding the basic connotation of 1C2S is that “within the unified People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan are permitted to practice capitalist systems, on the premise that the main body of the country practices a socialist system.”9 Put succinctly, it is “one country, two systems, a high degree of autonomy, and peaceful reunification.” The second is the particular connotation. In view of the particularity and complexity of the Taiwan issue, in addition to the general connotation of “one country, two systems,” the 1C2S Taiwan formula also has a special connotation different from “one country, two systems” as implemented in Hong Kong and Macau. Scholars have examined the particular connotations of the Taiwan formula mainly from three aspects: the basic principles or requirements, the path arrangements prior to reunification, and the institutional forms after reunification."
"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021","1. Basic principles or requirements. In contrast to the Hong Kong and Macau issue, the Taiwan issue is not only a remnant of China’s civil war. There are also external factors such as the United States involved, and its solution is clearly more complex and longer-term in nature. Consequently, using the “one country, two systems” approach to solve the Taiwan issue not only depends on the interaction between Taiwan’s internal political ecology and cross-strait relations, but is also to a great degree subject to the interference of external forces such as the United States and Japan, and its involvement in China’s internal affairs and diplomatic relations is also more complex. As a result, when some mainland scholars discuss the 1C2S Taiwan formula, they often pay special attention to first defining clear basic principles or requirements, in order to regulate the design of the political arrangements for the “two systems” Taiwan formula and ensure that its overall direction is stable and far-reaching, and then go on to propose a sensible and reasonable formula."
"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021","Li Jiaquan pointed out early on that the “one country, two systems” Taiwan model 10 must put forward four conditions, including principles (the one-China principle), peace (no U.S. intervention, no “independence” for Taiwan, then no use of force by the mainland), democracy (extensive solicitation of the Taiwanese people’s reasonable and feasible opinions), and equality (equal consultation and negotiation between representatives of the two sides).11 Li Yihu has argued that there are several requirements that the political design of the “one country, two systems” Taiwan model must pay attention to, mainly along the lines of conformity with “peaceful reunification and common development,” adherence to the one-China principle, and adjustment of the constitutional structure.12 Yu Keli examined the basic principles and main content of the “one country, two systems” Taiwan model from three aspects: the one-China principle, the long-term coexistence of “two systems” with a high degree of autonomy, and political negotiation.13 Zhang Nianchi and Sun Dayao and colleagues put special emphasis on the basic principle of joint cross-strait participation in negotiations. The 1C2S Taiwan formula is not imposed by one side on the other, but is the result of joint negotiations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.” 14 Without the Taiwanese people’s participation and struggle, even if “one country, two systems” were to be equivalent to “confederation” or “federation,” it would be difficult to fundamentally eliminate their mentality of fear and resistance. “Discussing reunification together and establishing one China together” is the inevitable path and mode for cross-strait reunification.15"
"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021","2. Path arrangements prior to reunification. Compared with Hong Kong and Macau, the most significant difference of the Taiwan issue lies in the fact that Taiwan has not yet achieved reunification with the motherland. Hence, in addition to designing a reasonable post-reunification institutional form, the 1C2S Taiwan formula must also include path arrangements that fit the pre-reunification development of cross-strait relations, i.e., path arrangements that regulate the state of cross-strait relations before reunification and promote the realization of cross-strait reunification. Many scholars have also carried out in-depth examinations of precisely this issue. Huang Jiashu believes that, under the status quo of “one China, and the two sides of the Strait not yet reunified,” the most important thing in the development of “one country, two systems” is to recognize that both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to the same country, while temporarily shelving or blurring the “two-government dispute” within “one country.” He further proposed the idea of “three steps,” the first step being to negotiate and reach an agreement, under the one-China principle, to end the current hostile state. The second and third steps are for both sides to negotiate on an equal footing, plan together, and discuss reunification to resolve the issue of “integrating the two governments into one government.”16 Li Yihu has mapped out a dynamic path for the 1C2S formula for Taiwan prior to reunification that includes three stages. It goes from the peaceful development stage to the political negotiation stage, then from political negotiation to a transitional stage prior to reunification. Finally, autonomous reunification would be achieved on the basis of it being entered into voluntarily on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. 17 Starting from the theoretical construction of the “one country, two systems” Taiwan model, Lin Gang also analyzes that “on the premise that the Taiwan authorities agree to the one-China framework or structure, using the ‘two governments, two systems’ model as a reasonable arrangement for cross-strait political relations before reunification…is in line with the fundamental interests of the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.” 18"
"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021","3. Post-reunification institutional arrangements. The issue of post-unification institutional forms is part of the core content of the 1C2S Taiwan formula. It is concerned with what kind of political arrangements—including power allocation, relationship positioning, and institutional structure, etc.—should be put into practice in cross-strait relations after the realization of reunification, under the framework of the basic principles of “one China, two-system coexistence, a high degree of autonomy, and peaceful reunification,” in order to ensure win-win post-reunification development. Solving the Taiwan issue is not about simply pursuing the goal of reunification; ultimately it must rest on the common realization of the “Chinese dream” on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, and the common achievement of the historical mission of the great rejuvenation of the nation. Based on this level of significance, whether, post-reunification, a system can be proposed that is satisfactory and acceptable to the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and that can promote both sides’ common development has become a top priority in research on the 1C2S Taiwan formula, and thus many scholars have made useful explorations on the topic."
"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021","Li Jiaquan suggested that, in order to maintain Taiwan’s “governmental structure” without violating the one China principle, the “large administrative region” structure that was implemented in the 1950s on the mainland can be applied to Taiwan’s institutional structure after reunification, with powers secondary to those of the central government but superior to those of the provinces and municipalities under its jurisdiction.19 Wang Liping has argued that the two systems in “one country, two systems” can also refer to a unitary system and a federal system, and that the post-unification system can also be a composite of a unitary system and a federal system. “As long as there are realistic and theoretical possibilities, ‘one country, two systems’ and the one China principle do not exclude using a federal system to achieve national unification.” Also, “if the unitary state absorbs some features of the federal system state in order to achieve national sovereignty and territorial integrity, even though it blurs the boundaries between the two forms of state structure, its value is that it is conducive to realizing the integrity of national unity and sovereignty.” 20 Drawing on certain “federal system” experiences, Wang Yingjin proposed a new conception of the 1C2S Taiwan model, its distinct feature being that it thinks through arranging for post-reunification Taiwan to enjoy the exercise of partial sovereignty (which does not imply recognition that Taiwan has “sovereignty”) or decentralized autonomy. In other words, “through cross-strait negotiations, the Taiwanese side will return to the Central People’s Government those parts of the exercise of sovereignty that can reflect national unification (e.g., diplomatic power), and the remainder that have not been returned will be retained by the Taiwanese side as ‘residual powers.'”21 It follows that the relationship between mainland China and the region of Taiwan would no longer be a relationship between central government and local government in the general sense, but a relationship between the central government and a “quasi-central government.” 22 Li Yihu argues that the construction of a constitutional republic, meeting Taiwan’s demand for protection of interests in terms of the source and distribution of power, could effectively solve the problem of post-reunification power distribution, reshape national identity, and thereby strengthen the acceptance and recognition of 1C2S by the people of Taiwan. 23"

These have all provided valuable contributions to the exploration of the institutional arrangements for the 1C2S Taiwan formula."

"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021","The connotations of the 1C2S Taiwan formula not only have rich origins in terms of thought, but also a deep theoretical basis, and reflect the innovation and development of related theories. Overall, existing research outputs have examined the theoretical capacity of the 1C2S Taiwan formula from four theoretical perspectives: Marxist philosophy, sovereignty and administrative power, state structural form, and constitutional jurisprudence. Since the 1C2S Taiwan formula is included in the 1C2S framework, scholars have mostly explored the theoretical basis and significance of “one country, two systems” as a whole."
"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021","1. Marxist philosophy. From the perspective of Marxist philosophy, scholars have analyzed the classical ideas of materialist dialectics, seeking truth from facts, and the unity of the “two-point theory” and the “key point theory” as the philosophical basis of 1C2S. On the other hand, they have also examined the important theoretical contributions of 1C2Sto Marxist philosophy. Mei Rongzheng believes that the 1C2S concept fully implements the “objectivity of observation” principle of Marxist dialectical materialism and historical materialism, that is, starting from reality and seeking truth from facts. Deng Xiaoping’s “one country, two systems” concept “did not start from individual theoretical branches or examples. Instead, starting from a comprehensive analysis of history and reality, the times and national conditions, its political design was developed by grasping the most essential, most wholly applicable ‘realities’.”24 Pan Shuming focuses on the 1C2S formula’s creative application of the essence of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, namely, seeking truth from facts.25 Yu Keli focuses on analyzing 1C2S as a model for the creative application of Marxist materialistic dialectics in three respects: fully embodying the dialectical law of the unity of opposites, developing the theory on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, and penetrating the “two-point theory” of dialectics. 26"
"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021",2. State structural form. A relatively large number of scholars have set out from the Marxist theory of the state or the theory of state structural form in constitutional theory to explore the theoretical implications of the adjustment of state structural form which the 1C2S Taiwan formula reflects. They have highlighted that the implementation of 1C2S is a breakthrough and innovation of the traditional concept of the unitary form of state structure.
"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021","Liu Haifan has pointed out that 1C2S is a creative development of the Marxist theory of the state. It implies relying on the state power with the proletariat occupying the ruling position to establish, on the whole, a strong, independent, democratic, and civilized state system at the primary stage of socialism, and at the same time unifying two regions with different social systems and different ideologies within one state.27 Liu Huanming and Zhang Bin also hold that the “composite-unitary” state model represented by “one country, two systems” is an innovation of Marx’s theory of state structural form. The 1C2S Taiwan model, as a new form of state structure that has yet to be settled, will not be a simple unitary system, let alone a typical federal system, but will be a unique form of state structure with Chinese characteristics, one between the unitary system and the federal system, for dealing with national issues and overall and local interests. 28 Wang Weixing has proposed that 1C2S is a new model of state structure that focuses on a unitary state structure while partially incorporating the beneficial elements of a composite system, which is a creation and breakthrough of state structure theory.29 Based on his exploration into the connotations of state structural form theory, Wang Yingjin specifically discusses the issue of how to judge whether a certain form of state structure has the characteristics of federalism, and argues that the practice of “one country, two systems” in Hong Kong and Macau does not have federal characteristics, while his conceptualization of the 1C2S Taiwan model actually is a “true unitary system with federal characteristics.”30"
"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021","3. Sovereignty and “administrative power.” Further extending and refining state structural form theory, some scholars also start from the perspective of sovereign power theory to focus on the key issue of how sovereignty and administrative power are distributed under the 1C2S Taiwan formula. The focus is on the 1C2S concept as an embodiment and innovation of the theory of sovereignty and administrative power. Wang Bangzuo and Wang Huning argue that 1C2S is a highly organic combination of sovereignty and administrative power: “One country” refers to the indivisibility of national sovereignty and the unity of the Chinese nation; “two systems” emphasizes a high degree of autonomy. 31 Huang Jiashu and Wang Yingjin propose a research framework on sovereignty composition, that is, 1C2S deals with the relationship between the ownership of sovereignty and the right to exercise sovereignty, changing the “passive separation” of the two into “active separation.” In “one country, two systems,” “one country” is the core and the goal, reflecting the uniqueness and indivisibility of sovereignty ownership; “two systems” is the means, the form for realizing national unification and sovereign integrity, reflecting the divisibility and transferability of the right to exercise sovereignty.32 Li Yihu emphasizes that China’s sovereignty is not currently divided, and that the pursuit of reunification through 1C2S is only at the level of the administrative power. Its point of departure is to pursue unification of the (actual) jurisdiction and management of public affairs. That is, it is intended to prevent the continuation of the abnormal state of separation of sovereignty from administrative power without the consent of all the people, and the danger of real division of sovereignty, and to find a model of national reunification acceptable to both sides of the Taiwan Strait that will facilitate comprehensive cross-strait reunification. 33 Yuan Zhengqing and Zhao Yang, starting from the perspective of sovereignty norms in international relations, point out that Deng Xiaoping’s vision and practice of “one country, two systems” is a Chinese innovation of sovereignty norms: first, it allows different types of political systems to co-exist and develop under the framework of one sovereign state; and second, the relationship between the two political systems is not parallel but subordinate. 34"
"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021","4. Constitutional jurisprudence Some scholars have also specially explored the constitutional and legal implications behind “one country, two systems” from a jurisprudence perspective. Firstly, scholars have considered the important value of “one country, two systems” from a constitutional perspective. In Li Yihu’s analysis, the construction of the 1C2S Taiwan formula is part of the regulation and allocation of vertical state power operation in the process of constructing China’s constitutional system and institutions. By constructing and improving the constitutional system it safeguards the rights and interests of citizens, dispelling the Taiwanese people’s doubts that their rights and interests cannot be guaranteed, strengthening the Taiwanese people’s identification with the state, promoting the realization of national reunification, and safeguarding the overall interests of the people of China as a whole, including Taiwanese people. 35 Wang Zhenmin suggests that the continuous deepening and innovation of the practice of “one country, two systems” will inevitably enrich and improve China’s constitutional theory and system, thereby creating a higher level of constitutional civilization. 36 Secondly, some scholars have analyzed the legal basis of “one country, two systems” and its innovation value from a legal integration angle. Rao Geping points out in his analysis that the civil law system characterized by statutory law and the common law system characterized by common law are not diametrically opposed and exclusive. Instead, they constantly enrich themselves by absorbing and transplanting each other’s advantages. Therefore, after 1C2S reunification, the various legal systems of mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan can learn from, draw from, and promote each other, maintaining the prosperity and stability of each, and this can enrich and develop the legal culture of the whole nation. 37 Chen Youqing has noted that 1C2S embodies the international law idea of the principle of peaceful coexistence. The theory of 1C2S introduces for the first time in the field of domestic law the international law concept of “peaceful coexistence, long-term coexistence, and common development” between two completely different and even long-standing opposing systems, thus expanding application of the peaceful coexistence principle to a completely new area. 38"

There is, for example, the issue of private legal conflicts involving mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau under “one country, two systems.” Liu Jingwei has systematically presented the relevant experience of other regions in international society concerning private law unification, and analyzed the humanistic, economic, and political basis for the unification of private law in mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau. 39"

"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021","Since the 1970s, with the rapid pace of change in motherland reunification and cross-strait relations, the thinking on, and exploration of, the 1C2S solution to the Taiwan issue have also seen constant adjustment and development. The forty year-plus process of evolution in motherland reunification and cross-strait relations has constituted a background of practice for going from solving the Taiwan issue based on the 1C2S approach to exploring the “two systems” Taiwan formula. Specifically, the existing research mainly analyzes three aspects of past practice with the 1C2S Taiwan formula: the evolution of the cross-strait relationship, the reaction to “one country, two systems” in Taiwan, and the international environment for Taiwan-related diplomacy."
"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021","1. Background on the evolution of the cross-strait relationship. The 1C2S Taiwan formula must be rooted in the specific practice of cross-strait relationship development and adapted to the actual conditions of the cross-strait relationship, and must serve the real need of promoting the two sides of the Strait to ultimately move towards reunification. The practice of cross-strait relationship development in recent years has mainly involved such content as the peaceful development of cross-strait relations, cross-strait political and economic interaction, and new discourse on Taiwan-related work. Li Jiaquan was relatively early in drawing out the close relationship between “one country, two systems” and construction of a framework for cross-strait peaceful development. Deng Xiaoping’s “one country, two systems” is itself aimed at peaceful development, in that it seeks to promote the peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues or the Taiwan issue. 40 The analysis of Yan Anlin, Zhang Zhexin and colleagues argues that the connotations and characteristics of the important expositions on Taiwan since the 18th National Party Congress, as well as the progress and experience in the cross-strait relationship’s peaceful development since 2008, have opened up the initial practice in the exploration of the Taiwan model of 1C2S, and have accumulated the necessary foundation for 1C2S to promote the reunification of the motherland.41 Li Fei and Liu Cheyuan specifically discuss the importance of cross-strait political and economic interaction for the realization of 1C2S. They argue that adopting an appropriate strategy of “separating politics and economics,” and constructing cross-strait economic cooperation mechanisms that meet the needs of the developing situation, would help cross-strait economic cooperation advance from functional integration to institutional integration, thereby promoting cross-strait political cooperation, and finally achieving peaceful reunification. 42 Zhu Weidong systematically illustrates the reunification strategy, from the necessity and inevitability of unification, to how and what to unify, and discusses the past practice of the 1C2S Taiwan formula in the new era.43"

Background of perceptions of “one country, two systems” among different parties in Taiwan. If the 1C2S Taiwan formula is based on the practice of peaceful reunification across the Taiwan Strait, research and explorations of the “two systems” formula obviously cannot ignore reactions of the Taiwan side. They must fully consider the social status of “one country, two systems” in Taiwan, and comprehensively analyze the perceptions and attitudes of the Taiwan authorities and society toward “one country, two systems.” Starting from the basic approach of placing hope in the people of Taiwan, the mainland side has always actively striven for “one country, two systems” to gain more acceptance and support from Taiwanese society. However, for a long time, “one country, two systems” has been stigmatized by the authorities in Taiwan, especially by the “Taiwan independence” separatist forces, and some of our compatriots in Taiwan have been misled and become prejudiced. Most scholars focus on the manifestations and causes of “one country, two systems” stigmatization in Taiwan, as well as countermeasures against it. Wang Zhiguo has pointed out that the questioning and smearing in Taiwan of “one country, two systems” are mainly reflected in areas such as the “dwarfing and annexation” of Taiwan, the “undemocratic nature,” the system’s design defects, and the failure of the “Hong Kong model.” Wang also presents a relatively comprehensive analysis of the reasons behind this, mainly including the significant differences between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait over political positioning, the Taiwanese people’s doubts and resistance with regard to reunification, and the negative impact of the “Hong Kong model.” 44 Yan Anlin et al. specifically examine the KMT’s and DPP’s negative perceptions of “one country, two systems,” and their reasons, with the key for the KMT being that they want “two systems” but not “one country,” while the DPP pursues “Taiwan independence.”45 Aside from this, based on an analysis of poll results in Taiwan society, Shao Zonghai emphasizes that the majority of Taiwanese people who choose “maintaining the status quo” actually agree implicitly with “two systems,” thus indicating that there may be room for the development of “one country, two systems” in Taiwan. 46"
"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021","3. Background of Taiwan-Related Diplomacy. The Taiwan issue is fundamentally a domestic issue for China, but due to complex historical and practical factors, since its inception it has inevitably been subject to influence and interference from the international situation and external forces. The international environment of Taiwan-related diplomacy has long constituted the key external context for exploring the 1C2S formula for Taiwan. Therefore, exploration of the 1C2S Taiwan formula requires a full understanding and proper handling of external factors and international conditions related to Taiwan, especially the Taiwan issue in Sino-U.S. relations. Li Yihu discusses the international prerequisites for the success of the 1C2S Taiwan model in terms of two aspects: consolidating and strengthening the “one China” arrangement in the international arena, and defusing the United States’ negative influence on Taiwan. He points out that, as the mainland accelerates the process of peaceful reunification, the United States may gradually increase its obstruction of the practice of the 1C2S Taiwan model. 47 In discussing the theoretical innovation of the 1C2S Taiwan model, Yan Anlin et al. have specifically examined new changes in the international environment on the Taiwan issue, including the internal logic and uncertainty of Trump’s policy toward Taiwan, and the historical and contemporary parallels of the Taiwan policy of Japan’s Abe administration.48 In addition, some scholars have focused on the international environment when 1C2S was first unveiled. They suggest that, on one hand, 1C2S was called for by the world’s historical trend and, on the other hand, it was also the result of the struggle and maneuvering between socialism and capitalism, represented by China and the United States, in the post-war “Cold War” period.49"

"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021","1. Differentiation between the Hong Kong-Macau model and the Taiwan formula. The 1C2S Taiwan formula and the Hong Kong and Macau model are both concrete forms for the realization of “one country, two systems,” and there are similarities between the two in terms of their basic connotations. However, in view of the differences in the nature of the Taiwan issue and the Hong Kong and Macau issues, obviously the Hong Kong and Macau model cannot be simply applied to the Taiwan formula, 50 and it is imperative that the differences between them are carefully clarified. Awareness that the 1C2S Taiwan formula differs from the Hong Kong and Macau model comes from Deng Xiaoping’s idea that “the solution to the Taiwan issue can be more lenient than that for the Hong Kong issue.” Based on the idea of “leniency,” one can see that compared to the Hong Kong and Macau model, the Taiwan formula is more open and tolerant, and has broader space for shaping."
"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021","In Huang Jiashu’s analysis, the most important differences between the “Taiwan model” and the Hong Kong-Macau model are: first, in the Hong Kong-Macau model, the British and Portuguese governments, as the counterparties in negotiations, recognized that the PRC government and the whole of China are, by nature, one and the same, while in the Taiwan model, the Taiwanese authorities refuse to recognize this identity; second, in Hong Kong and Macau there was never a power system operating in the form of a state, while in Taiwan there is a power system that operates in the form of a “state.” 51 Li Yihu sets out from “one country” and “two systems” as two aspects in discussing the differences between the Taiwan model and the Hong Kong and Macau model: first, in terms of the connotations of “one country,” the Hong Kong-Macau model is a vertical relationship between the central and local governments, while the Taiwan model is an “equal” parallel relationship between the two; second, in terms of what “two systems” connotes, aside from retaining its original social and economic systems, Taiwan can also retain military and political operational structures which were not present in the Hong Kong-Macau model.52"

The significance of the Hong Kong-Macau model as a reference for the Taiwan formula. “One country, two systems” was originally proposed in order to resolve the Taiwan issue, but it was first put into practice successfully on the Hong Kong and Macau issue. Without doubt, the experiences of Hong Kong and Macau have a very important inspirational role to play in the exploration of the Taiwan formula. However, in drawing lessons from this experience, it obviously cannot be a simple matter of repeating and copying, but instead must be rooted in the special circumstances of the Taiwan issue. After all, the Taiwan issue surpasses that of Hong Kong and Macau in both complexity and particularity."
"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021","Pan Guohua et al. and other scholars have analyzed the successful experience with 1C2S in Hong Kong as useful inspiration for solving the Taiwan issue, from four points of view: the first is institutional construction, building the “framework for the peaceful development of cross-strait relations;” second is prioritizing economics, the fundamental driving force for the integration of the mainland, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau; third is vigilance against populist politics, implementing incremental democratic politics; and fourth is striving for identity, the foundation of popular sentiment for national integration.53 According to Li Yihu et al., the setting of a transition period before the return of Hong Kong and Macau is where the model of the return of Hong Kong and Macau can be used as a reference for constructing the Taiwan model. Using the Hong Kong and Macau transition period for reference, after the two sides of the Taiwan Strait reach a peace agreement through political negotiations, they would enter a “pre-transition period.” During this period the two sides would, politically, jointly safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity on the basis of “one China”; and, economically, accelerate their integration to form an interdependent relationship. After this, the two sides would enter the “post-transition period” on the basis of jointly studied and formulated constitutional laws.54 With regard to the Hong Kong-Macau model as inspiration for cross-strait reunification, Wang Yingjin makes four points: first, a smooth transition period should be arranged before reunification; second, the specific operational techniques should be flexible; third, the status quo in Taiwan should be maintained to the maximum extent after reunification; and fourth, the foundation of cross-strait relations will be created by way of legalization.55"

"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021","Viewed as a whole, the existing research has carried out multi-dimensional, multi-perspective and multi-level basic research and analysis exploring of the 1C2S formula for Taiwan, and has achieved rich theoretical results and practical effects. It has provided important intellectual support for the development of cross-strait relations since the late 1970s and the promotion of the peaceful reunification of the motherland. Upon further analysis, the current research results on the mainland’s 1C2S Taiwan formula mainly reflect the following major features:"
"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021","1. Combination of history and reality. On one hand, scholars have not only paid close attention to the origins in thought of the 1C2S approach, and focused on exploring the historical origins of applying the 1C2S approach to solve the Taiwan issue, but have also systematically examined the historical background and traced the historical threads of the 1C2S Taiwan formula’s formation and development. On the other hand, existing research is also based on the real situation, with special emphasis on setting out from the real development needs of cross-strait relations at different stages to analyze the basic connotations of the 1C2S Taiwan formula, so as to explore paths for an 1C2S formula for Taiwan."
"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021","2. Uniting openness with principles. As an important result of the liberation in thought in the early stages of reform and opening up, the 1C2S approach has been characterized by distinctive openness and tolerance since its inception, and this has led to the study of an 1C2S Taiwan formula being characterized by significant openness. This openness is reflected in the study of origins of thought. The focus has been on contemporary Mao Zedong Thought, Western Marxist-Leninist thought, and Chinese historical and cultural thought. Second, in terms of research on the theoretical connotations, it has been rather open and inclusive in terms of theoretical capacity. It has not only involved analysis of mainstream theories such as Marxist philosophy, state structural form, sovereignty and “administrative power,” and constitutional jurisprudence, but has also included the theoretical investigation of some reunification models that are not “one country, two systems.” Of course, while emphasizing openness, the study of the 1C2S Taiwan formula has also always adhered to and upheld certain basic principles and requirements of the 1C2S approach. Regardless of the perspectives from which scholars expand and consider the 1C2S Taiwan formula, they are essentially all based on the fundamental connotations of the 1C2S principle, namely, “one country, two systems, a high degree of autonomy, and peaceful reunification.” They all adhere to the belief that “one country, two systems, a high degree of autonomy, and peaceful unification” is the best way to achieve national unification."
"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021","3. Combining disciplinary diversity and interdisciplinarity. First, existing research on the 1C2S Taiwan formula covers a very diverse range of disciplines, including Marxism, political science, law, economics, and so on. Scholars from different disciplines have each examined the origins of thought and theoretical scope of the 1C2S Taiwan formula from their own perspectives, which has widened the ambit of research on the 1C2S formula for Taiwan and made the basic content of study richer and more complete. Second, research on the 1C2S Taiwan formula also exhibits typical interdisciplinary characteristics. In exploring the theoretical basis and implications of the 1C2S Taiwan formula, some scholars have conducted interdisciplinary analyses by integrating the Marxist theory on the state, state structural form theory, and constitutional theory. Some have taken a political economy perspective to focus on the connections between 1C2S and the past practice of cross-strait political and economic interaction. All of this will promote the innovative development of research exploring the 1C2S formula for Taiwan and deepen understanding and awareness of the connotations of the policy propositions in the 1C2S Taiwan formula."
"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021","4. Giving equal weight to theory and practice. Although 1C2S is more of a policy practice issue, it would be difficult to make its formulation and implementation stable and far-reaching without the support of rich basic theoretical research. At present, research on the 1C2S Taiwan formula basically takes both theoretical and practical orientations into account. On one hand, more and more scholars have begun to delve deeper into the theoretical basis and significance of the 1C2S Taiwan formula, focusing on setting out from a thorough study of basic theory in order to explore the formula’s concrete institutional forms. Li Yihu [et al.]’s The ‘One Country, Two Systems’ Taiwan Model” and Wang Yingjin’s Research on National Reunification Models are representative of this kind of research. On the other hand, the academic community has all along particularly favored a practical orientation in research on the 1C2S Taiwan formula. Many scholars, based on a practical orientation, have long examined the peaceful development of cross-strait relations and 1C2S, the development of the 1C2S Taiwan formula in Taiwan, the practical significance of the Hong Kong-Macau model for the Taiwan formula, and so on. In recent years, the new practice of 1C2S in Xi Jinping’s important remarks on Taiwan-related work has also produced some excellent results."
"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021","ii. Shortcomings and problems in research on the “one country, two systems” Taiwan formula"
"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021","First of all, from the perspective of overall frameworks of thinking, there are currently two main problems in the relevant research on the 1C2S Taiwan formula. First, although existing research does give equal weight to theory and practice, in the context of the new era, there is an urgent need for 1C2S Taiwan formula research on both theory and practice to be further enriched and developed in order to keep up with the changing times. In terms of theoretical research, it remains necessary to continue improving both the breadth and depth of the theoretical capacity of the 1C2S Taiwan formula, not only by promptly absorbing the Centre’s new theories, new ideas, and new strategies on Taiwan-related work since the 18th Party Congress, but also by opening up thinking and more extensively incorporating the excellent theories and research results from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and abroad. With regard to practical research, the practical content of the existing studies has obviously lagged behind, focusing mostly on the practice of cross-strait relations development before the 18th Party Congress. In recent years, cross-strait relations and the international environment for Taiwan-related diplomacy have both undergone profound changes. Therefore, there is a great need to further enrich research on how to better promote exploration of the 1C2S formula for Taiwan based on new content regarding the Taiwan issue and the practice of cross-strait relations development since the 18th Party Congress. Second, there is a relatively obvious imbalance between static and dynamic research on the 1C2S Taiwan formula. Scholars have focused more on the institutional arrangements and sources of thought of the Taiwan formula at the static level, while research on dynamic changes in the context of Taiwan’s formula in practice has been lacking. Static research on the 1C2S Taiwan formula is primarily focused on establishing principles-based fundamental norms and political arrangements for after reunification. Such research falls under analysis of basic connotations and is of course very important. However, in the context of the Taiwan issue’s continuous development and evolution, it is also necessary to focus research on the dynamic context of the 1C2S Taiwan formula in practice prior to reunification."
"A Review of Current Research in Mainland Academia on the “One Country, Two Systems” Formula for Taiwan","Taiwan Studies , Huang Jichao , Jin Huanyu","Aug 1, 2021","Moreover, from the perspective of specific content, the study of the 1C2S Taiwan formula is still inadequate in the following four respects and awaits further strengthening. The first is differentiation along the reunification process. Studies have paid more attention to the post-reunification situation, focusing on how to design the post-reunification 1C2S Taiwan formula institutional structure. But there research is lacking on the content of pre-reunification 1C2S and the institutional arrangements for the transition period. To some extent, given that the country has not yet been reunified, it would be of more positive practical significance to conduct thorough explorations of democratic consultation and institutional arrangements for formulating and implementing the 1C2STaiwan formula prior to reunification. Second, although existing studies have focused on comparative research on the Hong Kong-Macau model and the Taiwan formula, still few have conducted comparative research considering the new situation in the development of the Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan issues. Of late, the practice of 1C2S in Hong Kong and Macau and the exploration of the 1C2S Taiwan formula have both encountered new problems and new situations, thus making it necessary for us to further consider and analyze the similarities and differences between the two solutions and the significance of the Hong Kong-Macau model’s lessons for the Taiwan formula. There are relatively big differences between the Taiwan issue and the Hong Kong and Macau issue in terms of their nature, international factors, historical factors, and practical factors, all of which need to be analyzed more meticulously in light of the new situation. Third, most of the basic theoretical studies on the 1C2S Taiwan formula have been conducted from political science and legal theory perspectives, and mainly explore macro-political issues such as sovereignty and “administrative power,” state structural form, and constitutional arrangements. Comparatively speaking, there is a lack of specialized research on issues of micro-governance arrangements involving fields such as Taiwan’s society, economy, and culture before and after reunification. Consequently, in the future, it will be necessary to extend research on the 1C2S Taiwan formula “downward,” strengthening the focus on more concrete socio-economic and cultural issues, and from there enriching research on concrete forms for realizing the 1C2S Taiwan formula and the connotations thereof. Fourth, the specialized study of the Taiwan side’s perceptions of 1C2S in the new situation needs to be further strengthened. In the final analysis, the policy orientation provides the basic footing for the study of the 1C2S Taiwan formula. Its aim is to propose a reasonable model of reunification that does not violate the one-China principle or the 1992 Consensus, but that also satisfies and is accepted by Taiwan’s authorities and its people, thereby actively contributing to the peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue. In recent years, under the influence of a series of complicated factors, the state of public perceptions of 1C2S in Taiwan has become increasingly grave, so there is an urgent need to strengthen research and offer policy thinking in this area. Starting from the basic requirement that the concrete realization of 1C2S in Taiwan “will fully take into account the realities of Taiwan, fully incorporate the opinions and suggestions of all sectors on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, and fully accommodate the interests and feelings of Taiwan compatriots,” 56 one of the important criteria for a good “two systems” Taiwan formula is that it not be limited to its own conceptual framework. In the design process, it should actively understand the objective research of Taiwanese scholars and the opinions and feelings of the Taiwanese people, and then take whatever is reasonable."

"Algorithmic Recommendations Can Finally Be Turned Off, China’s Provisions are a World First","Guancha , Xiong Jie","Mar 2, 2022","In his 2006 book Infotopia, Harvard University Professor Cass Sunstein introduced the notion of a kind of “information cocoon” in human society. He argued that in information dissemination, people’s own demands are not comprehensive, and instead they will just pay attention to selecting the information that they want and that can make them happy. Over time, the information they come into contact with becomes increasingly restricted. They become tightly wrapped up as though by the silk spat out by a silkworm, and ultimately shut themselves up inside an “information cocoon,” thus losing opportunities to encounter and understand different viewpoints."
"Algorithmic Recommendations Can Finally Be Turned Off, China’s Provisions are a World First","Guancha , Xiong Jie","Mar 2, 2022","Algorithmic recommendation may actually reinforce the information cocoon effect: the more interested you are in something, or the more inclined you are to a certain viewpoint, the more likely an algorithm is to recommend materials concerning that thing or materials supporting that viewpoint so that you are constantly reinforcing your own interests and inclinations. Moreover, algorithmic recommendations may also be used to purposefully guide populations and thereby influence public thinking and even influence political decisions. U.S. mathematician Cathy O’Neil thus refers to recommendation algorithms as “weapons of math destruction” in her book of the same name. These “weapons of mass destruction” have had a real-world impact many times in the past few years."

They put roughly 90 million U.S. dollars into digital ads. Project Alamo made use of subtle algorithmic recommendation techniques to influence voters: when an internet user was recognized as a “pivotal voter” (e.g., a swing voter in a swing county of a swing state), the social networks would direct content of a leading nature to such a voter and in this way influence the election outcome at relatively little cost."

"Algorithmic Recommendations Can Finally Be Turned Off, China’s Provisions are a World First","Guancha , Xiong Jie","Mar 2, 2022","The various forms of algorithmic recommendation include the forms enumerated in the Provisions, namely “generative or synthetic, personalized pushing, ranked selection, search filter, and decision-making and scheduling.” All the current mainstream methods of implementation use machine learning, and the principles behind them involve predictions based on Bayesian statistics—which sounds deep and unfathomable, but is in fact easily understood through a simple example."
"Algorithmic Recommendations Can Finally Be Turned Off, China’s Provisions are a World First","Guancha , Xiong Jie","Mar 2, 2022","Suppose that you cast a dice that has never been used. What do you think the probability is of getting a 6? Of course, in the absence of any additional information, your prediction would be “1 in 6.” Then you throw the dice 20 times in a row. Each throw results in a 6. At this point, what would you think the probability would be of getting a 6 on the next throw? Classical probability theory holds that each throw of the dice is an independent, random event—the results of previous throws do not affect the results of future throws—so your forecast should still be “1 in 6.” But obviously a normal person would not think in this way."
"Algorithmic Recommendations Can Finally Be Turned Off, China’s Provisions are a World First","Guancha , Xiong Jie","Mar 2, 2022","The information that “this dice came up a 6 in 20 straight throws” would clearly affect future decisions (for example, it might indicate that this was a leaded dice) and so you would predict a high probability of a 6 on the next throw. Simply put, Bayesian statistics “predict events that are to occur in the future based on events that have already occurred in the past.” All algorithmic recommendations are making these kinds of predictions:"

"Algorithmic Recommendations Can Finally Be Turned Off, China’s Provisions are a World First","Guancha , Xiong Jie","Mar 2, 2022","Each piece of attribute information like this is also called a “feature.” An internet company generally possesses thousands or tens of thousands of pieces of feature information on a single ordinary user. Some of this feature information comes from the company’s own business, but more feature information comes from other platforms. Enterprises such as the three main operators [China Mobile, China Telecom, and China Unicom], Weibo, Tencent, Alibaba, and mobile phone manufacturers all share users’ personal feature information with other internet apps in the form of software development kits."
"Algorithmic Recommendations Can Finally Be Turned Off, China’s Provisions are a World First","Guancha , Xiong Jie","Mar 2, 2022","Given a specific prediction, some of these pieces of feature information will have higher relevance to the prediction while other features will be of less relevance. If it is possible to trace back from the prediction result to those features that had an important effect, we can say that this algorithm is “auditable.” For example, the principle of a linear regression, which is the simplest, most basic machine learning algorithm, is to assign a weight to each feature based on past events and then to predict future events based on these weights. From a linear regression prediction model, it is possible to directly see the weight of each feature in the prediction. Therefore, a linear regression is an algorithm that is especially easy to audit."
"Algorithmic Recommendations Can Finally Be Turned Off, China’s Provisions are a World First","Guancha , Xiong Jie","Mar 2, 2022","Of course, the simplest, most basic algorithm suffers from the problem of insufficient predictive ability. Figuratively speaking, it is not possible to squeeze out all the information implicitly contained in feature values just by using a simple linear regression and so prediction results might not be especially good. Hence, scientists and engineers have thought up many methods for squeezing information from feature values. One method is called “feature engineering,” which put plainly means deriving new feature values from known feature values. For example, assigning a new label of “considerable buying power” or “fad follower” to a user based on the user’s mobile phone model or shopping list would be a simple instance of feature engineering."
"Algorithmic Recommendations Can Finally Be Turned Off, China’s Provisions are a World First","Guancha , Xiong Jie","Mar 2, 2022","Another way to squeeze feature values is to regard initial feature information as a “layer” of input and then to use various mathematical methods to convert the input layer into new information nodes and in this way form a multi-layer “network.” This process of conversion may be repeated, and the greater the number of conversion layers, the “deeper” the network is said to be—this is where the term “deep learning” comes from."
"Algorithmic Recommendations Can Finally Be Turned Off, China’s Provisions are a World First","Guancha , Xiong Jie","Mar 2, 2022","Although scientists often use “neuron” and “neural network” to analogize the results of these mathematical conversions, the information nodes resulting from these conversions often have almost no real world meaning, and are purely a product of mathematical tools. So there is a saying in the profession: deep learning is like alchemy (or, in China, “like concocting immortality pills”). You toss data into a neural network, and out come the results for reasons unknown to you. If the results are less than ideal, just add a few layers to the neural network."
"Algorithmic Recommendations Can Finally Be Turned Off, China’s Provisions are a World First","Guancha , Xiong Jie","Mar 2, 2022","Because deep learning is often cloaked in an alchemic-like aura of mystery, the engineers who use it often don’t know themselves why an algorithm is effective. For example, Google published a paper introducing their image recognition algorithm, which used a 19-layer-deep neural network (VGG19). However, Google’s photo service (Google Photos) was exposed on several occasions as having implicit racial bias. It even identified black people as “gorillas.” Subsequently, Google found it impossible to locate the problem in the algorithm. All it could do was delete the “gorilla” labeling action."
"Algorithmic Recommendations Can Finally Be Turned Off, China’s Provisions are a World First","Guancha , Xiong Jie","Mar 2, 2022","In spite of the warning offered by Google’s embarrassing failure, similar problems continue to pop up in the products of all the internet giants. In 2020, some Facebook users, while watching a video that featured a black protagonist, received a recommendation prompt asking them whether they wished to “continue watching videos about primates.” In 2018, Joy Buolamwini, a researcher in the MIT media laboratory, discovered that Microsoft, IBM, and Face++ facial recognition algorithms had a much higher gender identification error rate for black people than for white people. Moreover, the darker the skin color was, the lower the identification rate. The identification error rate for black females was as high 35%. An over-reliance on alchemic-type deep learning algorithms is the reason that these internet giants have a lackadaisical attitude towards algorithm audits. It also makes the job of amending implicit systemic discrimination more difficult."

"Algorithmic Recommendations Can Finally Be Turned Off, China’s Provisions are a World First","Guancha , Xiong Jie","Mar 2, 2022","It is precisely due to the industry’s reliance on algorithmic recommendations and deep learning technology that these Provisions appear to be especially important. The author believes that the announcement of the Provisions has, on the one hand, compelled internet enterprises to constrain their own behavior and use algorithmic recommendations for good purposes, i.e., upholding a mainstream value orientation and actively spreading positive energy, and not building information cocoons or inducing user addiction. On the other hand, it has compelled internet enterprises to strengthen the building of internal capabilities, i.e., establishing algorithm auditability and proactively selecting and optimizing recommendation algorithms that are comprehensible and auditable while avoiding “technology-only-ism” and over-reliance on alchemic-type recommendation algorithms."
"Algorithmic Recommendations Can Finally Be Turned Off, China’s Provisions are a World First","Guancha , Xiong Jie","Mar 2, 2022","However, being that these Provisions are a world first, the author still has some specific concerns relating to their implementation."
"Algorithmic Recommendations Can Finally Be Turned Off, China’s Provisions are a World First","Guancha , Xiong Jie","Mar 2, 2022","First, the question of how to implement algorithmic mechanism auditing and S&T ethics reviews may be a new challenge for regulators. Although the Provisions require that “algorithmic recommendation service providers shall regularly audit, evaluate, and verify algorithmic mechanisms, models, data, and application outcomes,” there may be a lot of space for fuzziness as to whether this requirement is actually put into practice, whether internet enterprises have really carried out audits, evaluations, and verifications, and whether algorithm results meet requirements. After all, an algorithmic recommendation audit is not like an illegal harmful information audit, where the discovery of illegal harmful information is sufficient to know immediately that there is a problem in the auditing process. The effects of algorithmic recommendations are manifested statistically over a long period of time and across a broad scope. How to determine whether an audit was truly implemented might in itself be a technical puzzle."
"Algorithmic Recommendations Can Finally Be Turned Off, China’s Provisions are a World First","Guancha , Xiong Jie","Mar 2, 2022","Second, on explaining the provision of algorithmic recommendation services and giving options for users to turn off personalized recommendations, although all the main internet enterprises have already created these functions, it is hard to say that that they are informing users “in a conspicuous manner.” The author, who is an IT professional and who was purposefully searching, still spent a fair amount of time before managing to locate the different places where the “turn off algorithmic recommendations” option was hidden in several of the major apps."
"Algorithmic Recommendations Can Finally Be Turned Off, China’s Provisions are a World First","Guancha , Xiong Jie","Mar 2, 2022","Of course, internet enterprises definitely hope to hide these functions where the majority of users cannot find them. After all, a function that the vast majority of users can’t find might as well be a non-existent function. If regulators are to prevent the right of “users to turn off algorithmic recommendation services” from becoming hollow words, shouldn’t they consider something along the lines of the [General Data Protection Regulation] (GDPR) and require that personalized recommendations be provided only after “express permission” from the user?"
"Algorithmic Recommendations Can Finally Be Turned Off, China’s Provisions are a World First","Guancha , Xiong Jie","Mar 2, 2022",The GDPR requires that websites obtain users’ express permission before recording user information via cookies. It compels websites to solicit user permission in a truly conspicuous manner.
"Algorithmic Recommendations Can Finally Be Turned Off, China’s Provisions are a World First","Guancha , Xiong Jie","Mar 2, 2022","Lastly, though internet enterprises will not be able to forcibly provide personalized recommendations under the Provisions, they may still coerce users into turning on (or being unable to turn off) personalized recommendations by engaging in “slowdowns.”"
"Algorithmic Recommendations Can Finally Be Turned Off, China’s Provisions are a World First","Guancha , Xiong Jie","Mar 2, 2022","To take Zhihu as an example, once one has selected the “turn off personalized recommendations” option in the privacy center, information cocoon-type recommended information will indeed stop, but there will also be a sudden drop in the volume of information that appears in the app. After turning off personalized recommendations, the author made a rough count and found that no more than three new items appeared daily on the Zhihu app’s “Select” page, while responses from many days earlier were still continuously appearing. On multiple occasions, two pieces of duplicate information appeared on the first page, yet content from the “Zhihu Hot List,” which gets the most traffic, was never pushed to the “Select” page. Is it possible that such a large company as Zhihu has no content to push to users after they turn off personalized recommendations? It seems likely that they are planning to use reduced content volume to present users with a combination of incentives and disincentives to keep them from turning off personalized recommendations. I believe that internet enterprises are capable of coming up with many more such slowdown methods. In implementing the Provisions, regulators will be faced with the new challenge of how they should discover and cope with these tricks."
"Algorithmic Recommendations Can Finally Be Turned Off, China’s Provisions are a World First","Guancha , Xiong Jie","Mar 2, 2022","These practical concerns notwithstanding, the Provisions have, after all, set a new precedent by regulating specific internet algorithms. Internet technology has long been regarded by the government and the public as a mysterious black box where only the externally visible results could be regulated. Capitalists and technologists were given too much space in which to play little games. I hope that the Provisions prove to be the first step in opening the black box and that, together with other future regulatory policies and implementation measures, they rip away the veil covering internet technology and expose the games hidden in the box to reasonable, regulatory sunlight. I also hope that the relevant regulatory authorities establish sufficient technological capabilities as soon as possible so as to truly put these regulatory measures into practice."

The United States’ deterrence by denial strategy began in the Cold War and led to large-scale civil defense construction and ballistic missile defense technology R&D during the Cold War. After the turn of the 21st century, the issues of missile defense and the empowerment of conventional weapons by emerging technologies have played an ever-expanding role in the security interactions of nuclear powers.1 U.S. deterrence policy also put greater emphasis on the importance of deterrence by denial methods, as represented by missile defense systems and new precision strike weapons."

Since then, there have been growing calls from within the United States to focus on the growth of Chinese military power and expand the application scope of deterrence by denial. After Trump took office, the “pessimists” in the United States who believed that China was about to gain a regional military dominance and squeeze the U.S. military out of the Western Pacific region gradually became the mainstream. They proposed that the U.S. military strategy and operational concepts should be adjusted to deny China the ability to operate basically without restrictions in the Western Pacific region.2 The Trump administration’s U.S. Strategic Framework for the Indo-Pacific also states that the United States will primarily deny China’s continued air and maritime superiority within the first island chain and dominate all areas outside the first island chain.3 After Biden took office, the role of military elements in the U.S. national security strategy continued to increase. Judging from the trends in U.S. military adjustments, the Biden administration’s strategy of deterrence by denial against China places more emphasis on the deployment of new forces and the coordinated denial among allies. Deterrence by denial against China has become a key element in the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy.4 The U.S. strategy of deterrence by denial against China has already deviated from the traditional model of deterrence by denial strategy and is evolving towards the integration of offense and defense. This is not only the result of the development of new military technology, but also the only way for the United States to consistently seek absolute security after the Cold War."

An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022","Although the concept of “deterrence by denial” was proposed relatively recently, the effectiveness of denial as a deterrent has existed since ancient times. From the Hexamilion Wall, where the Peloponnesian Alliance tried to stop the Persian invasion, to the French Maginot Line on the eastern frontier, the deterrent capabilities of these military forces were mainly reflected in their denial effect."
An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022",(i) Meaning and Features of Deterrence by Denial
An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022","In his 1961 book Deterrence and Defense, American deterrence theorist Glenn Snyder divided deterrence into deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial according to the effective logic of deterrence.5 He pointed out that deterrence by punishment means that the deterring party shows the deterred party that if the deterred party takes actions that disrupt the status quo, the deterring party has both the ability and determination to inflict large-scale damage to the deterred party. To make punishment credible, the deterring party often threatens to retaliate against an adversary’s non-military targets at any cost, although the line between non-military and military targets is sometimes blurred. In the aviation age before the nuclear age, a country’s long-range bombing capability could sometimes serve as deterrence by punishment. In the nuclear age, the promise of deterrence by punishment is mainly achieved by the enormous destructive power of nuclear missiles, but conventional punitive capabilities such as massive numbers of long-range strike weapons can also sometimes play a role.6 Deterrence by denial refers to the use of conventional means to crush the offensive attempts of the deterred party, thereby making the potential aggressor lose confidence that it can achieve its goals. The deterring party seeks to maintain the status quo with the goals of strengthening defenses or threatening to precisely destroy an adversary’s offensive forces during wartime.7 In general, deterrence by punishment is more of a cost-calculated strategy, while denial deterrence is a strategy measured in terms of benefits."
An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022","Snyder’s interpretation of deterrence by denial has been accepted by most deterrence theorists and is still used today. Starting from Snyder’s classic definition along with the particularity of deterrence by denial strategy as a military strategy, we can obtain the following three features of deterrence by denial:"
An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022","The first is the extensive range of methods for the use of power. In contrast to the strategic nuclear force that deterrence by punishment is more reliant on in the nuclear age, the forces required for deterrence by denial are broader. They include not only physical weapons traditionally used for defense and attack operations, but also combat operations methods used in intangible spaces, such as cyber weapons and electronic warfare weapons.8 The previous format of combat operations that was contact-type and relied on the use of weapons to kill enemies in order to seize territory has evolved into a non-contact type model that uses information technology to carry out combat operations in a range of different spaces. Therefore, in terms of forces, the United States’ deterrence by denial strategy relies more on various missile systems and information warfare systems. The frontier area where the United States carries out defense operations has also further expanded. There has been a shift from the focus on homeland defense during the Cold War to forward defense in front of the threat source, but this has not touched the “big rear” (大后方) targeted by deterrence by punishment forces."
An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022","The second is the real-time nature of threat actions. Deterrence is achieved through denial, not by threats of retaliation for status-breaking actions after the fact as in deterrence by punishment. Rather, the threat will directly deter, de-escalate, or delay offensive actions in near real-time. Therefore, a greater emphasis is placed on precision strike and damage-infliction capabilities. In order to achieve the goal of delaying an adversary on the battlefield, the deterring party must possess faster response capabilities or stronger defenses than for deterrence by punishment. After the deterring party demonstrates these capabilities to the deterred party, the deterred party will evaluate the possible obstacles and escalation options in its operation, and may abandon the operation. Deterrence by denial will be more credible if the deterring party had nuclear options available to it."
An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022","The third is the contest that occurs in the process of deterrence. Deterrence by denial has a greater reliance on conventional weapons. However, before the outbreak of a conventional war, when the deterring party credibly communicates its capabilities to win a conflict to the deterred party, this position of the deterring party is particularly contested by the deterred party. This is because the adversary may also hope to defeat the deterring party’s military by strengthening its own military-technical capabilities as soon as possible. The above situation certainly creates uncertainty about the outcome of deterrence by denial, but in the current era of systemic warfare, competition between two great powers centered on a single technology or single weapon is not enough to destabilize the deterrence. The deterring party needs to pay more attention to the new technological combinations of the deterred party and the new combat concepts it promotes. However, limited by the maturity of such technologies, it will take time for the deterred party to transform these factors into a threat to the effectiveness of deterrence by denial, and the deterring party will also seek to achieve a technological balance. Therefore, the fact that the process of deterrence by denial is contested does not necessarily have a fundamental impact on its effectiveness."

An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022","First, in terms of the practical effects of the two deterrence models, most case studies agree that deterrence by denial is more effective than deterrence by punishment. Paul Huth analyzed 58 deterrence cases from 1885 to 1984 and found that deterrence by denial had a higher chance of success and was more dependable than deterrence by punishment.9 There are two main reasons for this: First, in practice, the credibility of the deterring party’s commitment to inflict punishment has always been questioned. Second, the signals sent by deterrence by denial are very clear, and most deterred parties choose to re-evaluate their cost-benefit calculations after receiving such signals. Through comparative research, Robert Pape found that deterrence by denial as a military strategy is more coercive than deterrence by punishment, but it also requires the deterring party to possess sufficient deterrence capabilities.10 Alex Wilner’s analysis of the most recent practices of deterrence by denial showed that, at the level of Western grand strategy, deterrence by denial has had a far greater influence than is generally believed.11 In practice, U.S. policy in the Cold War was never one of simple deterrence by punishment.12 After the United States and the Soviet Union achieved an approximate nuclear balance in the late 1960s, they quickly shifted the field of competition to strategic defense. Both countries had an incentive to develop effective defensive methods to mitigate the damage inflicted by an opponent’s nuclear strike. It is only that, in practice, the development of strategic defense methods by both sides is constrained by technical complexity. Based on this, the United States and the Soviet Union made mutual compromises for a period of time and signed the ABM Treaty to maintain strategic stability."

Escalation is divided into horizontal escalation and vertical escalation. The former refers to the expansion of a conflict geographically or in terms of interests involved. The latter refers to a country’s determination to use strategic strike capabilities to try to reverse an unfavorable situation.13 Deterrence by denial seeks to avoid vertical escalation, but may lead to horizontal escalation. Deterrence by punishment obviously involves the direct risk of vertical escalation. In practice, even if the deterred party finds a vulnerable area in the deterring party’s denial forces and formulates a targeted action plan, the conflict will not rapidly escalate vertically, and the deterring party can choose to escalate horizontally to effectively deal with the action of the deterred party. Although the deterred party can also choose a strategy of limited aims and quickly draw back after obtaining moderate benefits to avoid escalation, this strategy can easily lead the attacker into a war of attrition against it and rarely succeeds in practice.14"
An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022","Finally, nuclear powers have a relatively deep awareness of deterrence by punishment in their long-term interactions, and there is already a great deal of shared understanding and even norms. The development of punitive capacity will also be subject to political constraints, but the same is not true of deterrence by denial, which is more influenced by a country’s strategic goals. After assessing the strengths of both parties, the deterring party can clearly assess its own strengths and weaknesses. If the strategic goal of the deterring party is to pursue advantages, it will use deterrence by denial as an effective engine for shaping strong military capabilities because deterrence by denial is less politically constrained than deterrence by punishment."
An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022","Although denial and punishment achieve their effects through different mechanisms, they are interconnected in practice. Judging from the deterrence practices of the United States after World War II, the United States does not apply a denial strategy alone, but tends to combine denial and punishment methods. This is largely due to the inadequacy of pure deterrence by denial. On the one hand, similar to the dilemma faced in nuclear deterrence, the risk calculation used in deterrence by denial is still very vague because it is difficult to accurately gauge the adversary’s intentions. The more uncertain the deterring party is about an adversary’s motivations and the quality of its own defenses, the more difficult it will be to adjust its military strategy to better deter the adversary. On the other hand, the new military revolution has brought many new changes to deterrence by denial, and asymmetric strike advantages can already be achieved under certain conditions.15 In order to ensure the effectiveness of deterrence by denial, if faced with a major power whose strategic power is increasing or even drawing even in some capabilities, the deterring party will inevitably develop forces with asymmetric or even new-generation advantages. However, the technical risks and (time, economic, and political) costs of developing such capabilities are subject to significant uncertainty. Therefore, in practice, the United States will use punitive measures to shift part of the pressure on its maintenance of effective deterrence, but this cannot solve the series of problems brought about by deterrence by denial."

An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022","According to the definition given above, denial is the capability of the deterring party to convince the deterred party that the deterring party has the ability to prevent it from obtaining potential benefits. The best manifestation of this capability is not directly threatening to inflict massive costs on the deterred party, but altering the deterred party’s intentions by changing its potential benefits. Accordingly, there are two ways to achieve deterrence by denial."
An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022","The first is to threaten to greatly reduce or even eliminate the expected effect of the opponent’s attack through various passive defense measures. Passive defense measures are mainly used to strengthen the invulnerability of one’s own military capabilities and to preserve effective forces as far as possible. Medieval castles and the trenches during World War I were passive defense measures. However, in the age of informatized warfare, the battlefield support roles of cyber capabilities and space assets have become increasingly prominent. In addition to the traditional strengthening of the construction of fixed defense facilities and protecting critical infrastructure, passive defense measures also include elements such as increasing the redundancy of the national command and control system and enhancing the resilience of cyber capabilities and space assets. The importance of these passive defense measures in the security and military strategies of major powers is increasing. It must be noted that although the above concepts or methods focus on defense, they also play an important supporting role in the offensive missions of great powers and are an indispensable and important part of deterrence by denial strategies."
An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022","The second is to threaten reciprocal counterattacks or even preemptive action when war is imminent in order to make the deterred party worry that their ultimate goal cannot be achieved so as to abandon the action. This approach puts more emphasis on the use of superior conventional combat capabilities to achieve deterrence by denial. It is determined by the range of the forces used for deterrence by denial and the challenges met in the deterrence process. Of course, in most cases, it is difficult for the deterring party to maintain this type of denial capability alone. Therefore, allies and partners with common deterrence goals become important partners of the deterring party. Given the real-time and contested nature of deterrence by denial, the deterring party must particularly guard against surprise attacks by the adversary. The deterred party will be attracted by the possibilities created by a sudden attack. This sort of move will allow them to demonstrate their strength to the deterring party and thereby reap the benefits.16 However, in informatized warfare, with the continuous proliferation and use of emerging technologies, especially precision-guided weapons, the possibility of preventing a deterred party from launching a surprise attack will greatly increase.17 Deterrence by denial will rely more on such weapons to increase its credibility. Moreover, if the deterring party has such a powerful conventional strike force and the adversary continues to provocatively challenge the deterring party’s previous commitments, the deterring party may also send some signals to threaten preemptive action, so as to achieve a deterrent effect."

During the Obama administration, the representative figure who supported deterrence by denial against China was Andrew S. Erickson of the U.S. Naval War College. He believed that in the face of future Chinese control of the disputed islands, the United States does not necessarily have to defeat China, but only prevent China from achieving its goals. To this end, the U.S. military should develop direct defense and area denial capabilities.18 However, at that time, the U.S. military in the Western Pacific region possessed an advantage over China and would not fully adopt this defensive posture.19 However, considering the gradual decline in the survivability of U.S. military targets in the “first island chain,” the United States is also seeking to improve the damage-resistance capabilities of its own bases and promote the construction of a theater missile defense system aimed at China."
An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022","After Trump took office, China became a “primary competitor” as defined by the United States. The United States believes that the rapid increase in Chinese military power has made its forward presence in the Western Pacific “unprecedentedly vulnerable”, its military presence in the “first island chain” faces a real threat from China’s “anti-access/area denial” capabilities, and the support and logistical assurance deployments in the “Second Island Chain” have also become less secure due to the threat of medium and long-range strikes.20 On this basis, many security experts who have served in the U.S. Department of Defense believe that U.S. military strategy should further adopt the perspective of deterrence by denial, taking the opponent’s military capabilities as its main target and strengthening its own defense.21 Eric Heginbotham suggested that a global power like the United States cannot allocate the same proportion of resources to the Western Pacific region that China can, so denial is a reasonable compromise.22 Michael Beckley believed that the United States should take advantage of the existing military balance in the Western Pacific region and adopt an “active denial” strategy consisting of three elements: reducing its own forces, improving the denial capabilities of its allies, and supporting allies when necessary.23 Jacob Cohn and others suggested that the United States could deploy short- and intermediate-range missiles in Japan, Taiwan, or the Philippines in the future for the purpose of deterrence by denial.24 Eugene Gholz and others advocated that the United States establish a set of “concentric circles”, relying on the numerous small islands from Japan to the island of Taiwan to the Philippines, in order to build more dispersed bases.25 Through an in-depth analysis of key U.S. strategic documents and extensive interviews with U.S. defense officials, Luis Simón found that the United States has been constantly working to reconcile deterrence by punishment and by denial. He believes that the United States should focus on investing in deterrence by punishment, while actively encouraging allies to develop deterrence by denial capabilities.26"

Elbridge Colby made it clear in 2013 that the Obama administration’s model of strategic stability was too rigid and that the United States must consider the first use of nuclear weapons if it wanted to maintain its dominance in the Pacific.27 After joining the Trump administration as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy and Force Development, he continued to emphasize this view and received support from a number of senior officials. However, Colby turned to support the Sino-U.S. “limited war” theory in 2021, arguing that deterrence by denial was more effective and more necessary than pure nuclear deterrence. He proposed that the United States can weaken China’s ability to act by selecting appropriate allies and working together to deter China. He also confidently believed that as long as the United States clearly indicates the goal of denying China (referring to the Taiwan region), then the security dilemma between China and the United States should be manageable, with very low costs and risks.28"

Some of their proposals echo the content of the 2018 National Defense Strategy, the 2019 Missile Defense Review, and other documents that advocate the strengthening of deterrence by denial against China, which have become an important reference for the United States as it builds forces for deterrence by denial against China."

An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022","In 2012, the Obama administration officially launched the “Rebalancing Toward Asia-Pacific” strategy. At the official level, deterrence by denial became an important way to deal with the so-called “China challenge.” Its outstanding manifestation was that the United States strengthened the deployment of conventional forces in the Asia-Pacific region and concentrated Asia-Pacific region missile defense systems in Northeast Asia, taking into account both tactical and strategic missile defense capabilities. However, out of a desire to maintain the positive cooperative relationship between China and the United States, many strategic documents of the Obama administration declared that they aimed to establish a strategic and stable relationship with China. The 2010 Missile Defense Review also made a vague statement about the policy of deterrence by denial against China and did not deliberately emphasize China. After a major debate within the United States about its policy toward China in 2015, the U.S. military strategy underwent a partial adjustment. The 2015 U.S. National Military Strategy report groundlessly accused China of creating tensions in the Asia-Pacific region and emphasized the need to regularly demonstrate willingness and capability to act through forward deployed, rotating, and globally responsive forces to be ready to directly prevent adversaries from achieving their goals.29 This showed that the United States’ deterrence by denial strategy against China was becoming more focused [摆脱之前的游离状态, literally “get rid of its previous state of disassociation/drift”]."

It can be understood as an enhanced version of passive defense."
An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022","First, the United States is focusing on building and strengthening the resilience of military bases in the Western Pacific region. For the United States, due to its limited number of bases in the Western Pacific region and their remoteness from the homeland, effective deterrence is difficult to achieve if these bases lack resilience. Therefore, the United States is focusing on enhancing the resilience of air and sea bases in the Western Pacific region, primarily including region-wide intelligence support, base expansion, and sea and air force preparation in order to complicate the opponent’s offensive plans. The Trump administration focused on improving the survivability of ground forces and expanding the reserve support capabilities of the “second island chain.” The U.S. Air Force spent $260 million to expand and upgrade its base on Guam to accommodate Marines withdrawn to the base from the “first island chain” and accommodate more tankers, large transport aircraft, and bombers.31 In addition to strengthening the construction of Guam’s resilience system, the United States also plans to develop old bases on islands such as Tinian and Saipan. Through the combination of a few high-quality large bases and many lower-quality small bases, the United States is striving to build a more resilient group of bases in the Western Pacific region so as to carry out its distributed combat deployments and strengthen the invulnerability of its combat systems. Therefore, the new base group will also become an important support point for the United States as it implements its strategy of deterrence by denial against China and maintains its hegemony in the Pacific region. In terms of service construction, the navy, as the mainstay of the U.S. military, emphasizes the forward deployment of distributed combat forces to increase the difficulty of attacks by opponents. At the core is the construction of a (manned/unmanned) fleet with both quality and quantity, with small and medium-sized and highly mobile formation forces deployed at strategic chokepoints to carry out so-called “sea denial.” The Marine Corps also proposed a new “Expeditionary Advance Base Operations” (EABO) concept, which aims to bring together resources to continuously strengthen the “resilience” of bases and islands in the Western Pacific region, seek to establish a series of bases, and launch missiles flexibly (including land-based intermediate-range missiles) to form deterrence by denial."

Together, these two approaches maximize deterrence. U.S. deterrence by denial in cyberspace emphasizes the importance of resisting and defending against attacks, with a focus on securing and maintaining the government assets that form the basis of U.S. national power as well as systemically important critical infrastructure. The report released by the U.S. “Cyberspace Solarium Commission” clearly stated that the United States will be committed to building a multi-level, compound-type cyber deterrence strategy. The core layer of the “Layered Cyber Deterrence” strategy is the denial of benefit layer, and the key is to strengthen network resilience and defense capabilities.32 Strengthening the integrated cooperation of cyber defense and attack capabilities is an important part of the United States’ promotion of cyber security cooperation in its Asia-Pacific alliances. Asia-Pacific allies have strengthened their military capabilities and coordination in cyberspace by participating in the United States’ “CyberStorm” series of military exercises.33"
An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022","Finally, in terms of space-based denial capabilities, the United States has made great efforts to enhance the resilience and defense capabilities of space systems in order to improve the damage-resistance of its space assets. As early as 2013, the U.S. Air Force Space Command called for enhanced resiliency of space assets. However, at that time, the technology for the mass production of satellites was not yet mature, so “resilience” remained at the conceptual stage. By 2016, the U.S. intelligence community believed that China’s anti-satellite capabilities had improved again. At the same time, the commercial satellite industry in the United States was gradually emerging and micro-satellite technology, on-orbit satellite mobility technology, and satellite on-orbit detection and maintenance capabilities had all greatly improved, so the construction of a new decentralized and resilient space system began to receive attention. The United States also reintroduced the concept of “space resilience” that year. The 2018 edition of the U.S. National Space Strategy re-emphasized the concept of “resilience,” arguing that accelerated change is needed to enhance the resilience, defense capabilities, and restoration following attack of space structures.34 The “Starlink” plan proposed by SpaceX and strongly supported by the U.S. government and the Space Force intends to use the most advanced satellite manufacturing technology and the most economical launch methods to achieve resilient architectures for space-based systems and assist the U.S. military in communications, navigation, and other tasks."

In addition, China’s hypersonic missile technology is also making rapid progress, and it is very difficult for current U.S. missile warning systems to detect these weapons.35 Therefore, the Trump administration expanded the mission of missile defense in the Missile Defense Review, including cruise missile defense and hypersonic missile defense as part of the three goals of missile defense for the first time.36"

The U.S. defense budget for fiscal year 2019 supports an increase in the number of ships that make up the sea-based “Aegis” regional missile defense system from 38 to 60 by 2023 as well as the purchase of the more advanced “SM-3 Block IIA” interceptor developed by the United States and Japan.37 The “Aegis” ships equipped with the new interceptor are expected to perform combat missions mainly in the Pacific region.38 The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) is also striving to fully upgrade the Aegis combat management system to “Baseline 9.” This version is the first to integrate the air defense and ballistic missile defense capabilities of the “Aegis” system and has become the core system of the U.S. Navy’s integrated air defense and missile defense capabilities.39 The upgraded “Aegis” ships equipped with “SM-3” missiles can perform mid-course interception missions, which will enhance U.S. missile defense capabilities in the Western Pacific region. In addition, the Trump administration also attached great importance to improving the performance of cruise missile detection sensors and continuously developed defense and interception technologies for hypersonic weapons. The main idea is to comprehensively use multi-domain, all-platform, and multi-sensor collaborative detection and use a multi-layer missile defense system for interception, while simultaneously seeking more economical and effective low-cost weapons to put into combat applications, so as to build a layered multi-domain missile defense system aimed at China.40"

so that they can better protect their territories and enforce their maritime rights.41 At the end of 2017, Japan decided to purchase two land-based “Aegis” systems from the United States in response to the missile threat from China and North Korea. Although the project was ultimately canceled for cost and technical reasons, Japan instead decided to upgrade its sea-based national missile defense system and received strong support from the United States. The United States has invested in helping the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force carry out R&D and system integration for the “Aegis” and Baseline 9. The new system is installed on Japan’s new generation of Maya class destroyers and can launch “SM-3 Block IIA” interceptors.42 U.S.-Australia anti-missile cooperation reached a relative high point during the Trump era. Australia has decided to install the “Aegis” system on its most advanced Hobart-class destroyers. According to media speculation, after all nine new “Hunter” class frigates are launched in 2028, Australia will have the largest “Aegis” fleet except for the U.S. Navy.43 Although the Taiwan authorities are not a treaty ally of the United States, the Trump administration placed a high value on the improvement of Taiwan’s denial capabilities. Shortly after Trump took office, he approved the sale of early warning radar monitoring technical support system and “SM-2” missile components to Taiwan, and in July 2020, he sold them the supporting equipment and technology of the “PAC-3” system. This series of actions shows that an important way for the Trump administration to strengthen deterrence by denial capabilities around China, and especially air and missile defense capabilities, was to provide allies with technical or equipment support to enhance their denial capabilities, allowing them to work together to deter China."

First, if a massive number of land-based intermediate missiles are deployed in a widely dispersed manner, it will introduce uncertainty to China’s strategic calculations and effectively consume various types of Chinese missiles. Second, land-based intermediate missiles can help shape the United States’ combat readiness posture (应战态势), thereby enhancing the credibility of its deterrence by denial. Third, the mass deployment of land-based intermediate-range missiles will force China to invest in expensive defense and resilience measures, rather than continuing to develop asymmetric capabilities.

Therefore, the Trump administration believed that they just had to get rid of the restrictions of the INF Treaty so that the United States could deploy conventional missile systems and disperse them among combat units throughout the “first island chain” or “second island chain” so as to achieve a balance between China and the United States in the field of intermediate-range missiles.44"

In fact, the United States started the pre-research tasks for this project long before it withdrew from the INF Treaty. After the formal withdrawal, the Army Modernization Strategy made Long-Range Precision Fires (LRPF) a top priority.46 The PrSM has also successfully entered the formal R&D and production stage. The missile was successfully tested for the first time in December 2019, and has been improved and tested many times since.

The United States is committed to preventing military attacks on itself and its allies and partners and promoting so-called “regional security” through the development of new capabilities, operational concepts, military activities, defense industry initiatives, and a more resilient force posture.47 This “integrated deterrence” means integrating the main combat equipment and key facilities of the United States and its allies and simultaneously using new technologies to empower existing military missions in order realize the full-spectrum advantage of the combat capabilities of the U.S. military in the Western Pacific region and thereby improve overall deterrence. The United States deploys highly dispersed but highly connected military forces to increase the resilience and flexibility of deterrence forces, while leveraging emerging technologies in an effort to improve the battlefield awareness, projection capabilities, and strike effectiveness of deterrent forces. A direct goal of the Biden administration’s military strategy toward China remains the use of a combination of offensive and defensive means to deter and disrupt China’s rapid military operations and strive to limit damage to U.S. military bases, even outside the territory of allies and partner countries. The Biden administration’s new National Defense Strategy briefing has also made it clear that the Missile Defense Review and Nuclear Posture Review will be included in the text of the National Defense Strategy.48 This illustrates that the core goal of the Biden administration’s “integrated deterrence” is to complicate China’s military preparations in the Western Pacific by integrating deterrence by denial and deterrence by punishment and consolidating currently available deterrence methods."

Its basic significance is to destroy and weaken Chinese strike plans and capabilities targeting U.S. troops and infrastructure by heavy investment, or to be able to suppress China early in a conflict and ensure that the United States has absolute military advantages, thereby deterring the Chinese army from quickly defeating the U.S. military at a lower cost.49 The Biden administration requested a $6.1 billion budget for the “Pacific Deterrence Initiative” in fiscal year 2023, to be used for the development and upgrade of denial capabilities such as military construction, Guam defenses, and missile warning and tracking architecture.50 According to the FY 2023 budget application form for the “Pacific Deterrence Initiative” released by the U.S. DoD, excluding routine drills and training projects, “modernizing and strengthening regional presence” and “improving infrastructure to enhance U.S. military response and resilience capabilities” will be the main concerns of the “Pacific Deterrence Initiative” over the next five years.51 This shows that the Biden administration’s strategy of deterrence by denial against China will focus on continuously enhancing the forward presence of the U.S. military in the Western Pacific region and attempts to improve deterrence and response capabilities in this region through superior conventional forces, focusing on land and sea denial and missile defense capabilities."

An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022","In order to develop precision strike capability that can deny China, the United States has been spending heavily to purchase new precision strike weapons and accelerate their deployment in recent years. Several intermediate-range missile programs started under the Trump administration have continued after Biden took office. The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command regards the construction of a “highly survivable precision strike network along the first island chain” as one of its core tasks and plans to establish a precision strike network with a range of more than 500 km in the “first island chain.”52 In addition to promoting the rapid production of precision strike missiles, the Biden administration has also continued to advance the new intermediate-range missile program launched at the end of the Trump administration, seeking to upgrade the “Tomahawk” and “SM-6” missiles used by the Navy to land-based versions. To this end, the Biden administration has overcome many technical and financial obstacles and tried to transfer more resources to the rapid R&D of new conventional precision missiles. For example, the short range and high cost of the “SM-6” once discouraged the U.S. Army from adopting it, and outside observers also speculated that the land-based “SM-6” might not be the preferred choice.53 However, considering that this type of missile will be the future hub of the Army’s Multi-Domain Task Force’s intermediate-range strike force, the Biden administration persisted in investing heavily in order to integrate the “SM-6” into land-based mobile platforms as quickly as possible and create combat effectiveness. The Biden administration requested $409 million for the new intermediate-range missile program in FY 2023, five times the initial funding the Trump administration provided for the program in FY 2021.54 The implementation of the new intermediate-range missile program will complement the ground and sea strike capabilities of U.S. Navy ships and threaten targets within China’s defense in depth region. Although it has only been two years since the United States withdrew from the INF Treaty, the land-based INF program is advancing extremely rapidly due to benefits from the accumulation of early-stage technologies, and it is expected to generate initial combat effectiveness as soon as 2023.55 After finding suitable deployment sites, the precision missile strike network along the “first island chain” will gradually take shape."
An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022","As part of a deterrence by denial approach, defense in depth refers to holding off an attacker through a series of defensive positions with the aim of repressing the offensive firepower of the attacker at each position. However, the most notable disadvantage of this strategy is that it requires a lot of resources, so defenders are more likely to employ defense-in-depth strategies to protect a particularly important location.56 In the view of Biden’s military team, Guam is currently just such an important defensive position. Guam’s current missile defense mission is maintained by “THAAD” and “Aegis” ships, but Indo-Pacific Command believes that this is far from enough. Shortly after Biden took office, former Indo-Pacific commander Philip Davidson and current commander John C. Aquilino showed Congress the importance of Guam as the missile defense hub of the “second island chain” and its favorability for the land-based “Aegis” system. The DoD then asked the Missile Defense Agency to conduct a preliminary study. According to the information released by the Missile Defense Agency, the land-based “Aegis” system designed for the Indo-Pacific Command will be specially used to intercept various types of Chinese missiles. It is equipped with “SM-3” missiles to intercept ballistic missiles and “SM-6” missiles to intercept cruise missiles.57 The Biden administration requested $892 million in the defense budget for FY 2023 to strengthen Guam’s defenses, mainly to improve missile defense capabilities.58"
An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022","Although “Aegis” is already a relatively mature interception system, the Indo-Pacific Command said that related missile defense equipment will also be deployed in Guam after other new interception methods are successfully developed.59 The U.S. military vigorously promotes the “UAV-borne Directed Energy Weapon” project, intending to load high-energy lasers on UAVs to intercept missiles in the booster stage so as to minimize the lethality of incoming missiles.60 In fact, as the military applications of directed energy technology continue to mature, the power of directed energy weapons will be increased while reducing the influence of limiting factors. The potential advantages of these weapons, such as extremely low single-shot cost, nearly unlimited ammunition, and rapid engagement, can provide the U.S. military with sustained tactical and strategic advantages. In February 2022, Heidi Shyu, the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, called on the DoD to make directed energy one of its priorities for maintaining U.S. technological superiority and called for the construction of a robust and reliable supply chain for this purpose.61 If mature directed energy technology is used for missile interception, the cost-effectiveness of missile defense will be greatly increased, and the United States will achieve a qualitative leap in its deterrence by denial capability against China."

An important goal of the “integrated deterrence” strategy is to incorporate allied forces into its deterrence system. The U.S. military believes that, due to factors such as the defense budget, it faces many difficulties in the modernization of nuclear weapons systems, the procurement of advanced weapons and equipment, and the R&D of emerging disruptive technologies. Their existing platform capabilities can no longer effectively meet the needs of strategic deterrence and day-to-day military operations. Therefore, it is necessary to utilize allied forces to strengthen the deterrence capability. From this perspective, “integrated deterrence” is actually an important measure in the current reconstruction of a new type of alliance system by the Biden administration."
An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022","Improving the precision strike network is the main measure taken by the Biden administration to build “first island chain” deterrence by denial capability. It is worth noting that although allies are more cautious about the deployment of intermediate-range missiles by the United States, their enthusiasm for R&D of intermediate-range missiles has not diminished. In May 2021, the Biden administration decided to terminate the U.S.-South Korea Missile Guidelines, allowing South Korea to develop various types of missiles under permitted conditions. Australia and the United States signed a memorandum of understanding in September 2021 to participate in the development of precision strike missiles.62 In January 2022, the United States and Japan issued a statement after their “2+2” talks, saying that the two sides “committed to increase joint/shared use of U.S. and Japanese facilities, including efforts to strengthen Japan Self-Defense Forces’ posture in areas including its southwestern islands.”63 Once the United States and Japan complete the corresponding work, they will be able to quickly deploy and replenish weapons and ammunition near the Taiwan region. Like Trump, Biden also set about planning to continue to improve Taiwan’s denial capabilities after taking office: In February 2022, it approved the sale of U.S. $100 million worth of “Patriot” system engineering service support to Taiwan for a period of five years. In April, it announced the approval of the “Patriot Project Personnel Technical Assistance Case” with a total sales price of U.S. $95 million. As the Biden administration accelerates the construction of a system of deterrence by denial forces targeting China, it may continue to provide some key denial capabilities to Taiwan in the future."
An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022","Situational awareness is an important component of U.S. denial capabilities. Considering the geographical advantages of allies and partner countries, deepening intelligence sharing and cooperation with them has become a key part of the U.S. strategy of deterrence by denial against China, as well as one of the most highly valued measures in the Biden administration’s “Indo-Pacific Strategy.” The United States has established relatively mature bilateral intelligence sharing and cooperation mechanisms with Japan, South Korea, Australia, and India, but the Biden administration is not satisfied with this and is seeking more multilateral intelligence partnerships. The underlying intent is to shape a coordinated deterrence posture against China and enhance U.S. denial capabilities. The United States, Japan, and Australia fully utilize their trilateral intelligence sharing mechanism to try to achieve “seamless cooperation.” Moreover, the Biden administration intends to further build a multilateral intelligence cooperation mechanism among the United States, Japan, India, and Australia through the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD). On May 24, 2022, the United States, Japan, India, and Australia announced the launch of the  Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness (IPMDA) after the QUAD Leaders’ Summit. They also said that this move will enhance the maritime situational awareness of countries in the Pacific, Southeast Asia, and the Indian Ocean in order to “maintain a free and open Indo-Pacific.”64 It is not difficult to see that this action by the Biden administration is actually exploring a way to build a quadrilateral intelligence sharing mechanism targeting China with the United States, Japan, India, and Australia. When the time is right, the United States may also pull South Korea into this multilateral mechanism. At such a time, China’s maritime military security will face more complex challenges."

It has been subject to a considerable number of constraints at home and abroad. In the Western Pacific region, it is mainly constrained by the security interests of allies and partner countries. In the United States, there are fierce debates and contradictions among parties in Congress on how to better coordinate the buildup of denial forces."
An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022",(i) Regional Countries Question the Necessity of Some U.S. Denial Capability Deployments
An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022","The U.S. strategy of deterrence by denial against China places great importance on coordination with allies and partners in the Western Pacific region. In theory, with the express consent of treaty allies, the United States could deploy a variety of equipment at bases under its jurisdiction. As the U.S. deterrence strategy toward China shifts to deterrence by denial, the military value of allies will be greatly enhanced, which will benefit both the U.S. and its allies. At present, however, the treaty allies are still more cautious about attaching themselves to the United States. Instead of letting the United States deploy new equipment at will, they selectively allow the entry of some military equipment to enter their territories, and deny entry to equipment that may cause a sharp deterioration in the regional situation. We can consider land-based intermediate-range missiles as an example. Although the United States has consistently expressed its desire to deploy land-based intermediate-range missiles in the Western Pacific region since its withdrawal from the INF Treaty, the RAND Corporation believes that, as long as the current domestic political situations of the five U.S. treaty allies and the security trends in the region do not change drastically, the possibility of the allies accepting land-based intermediate-range missiles is very low.65 The main concern of the allies is their worry that accepting the deployment of ground-based intermediate-range missile systems in their own countries will be regarded as a very provocative action by China, thereby intensifying military and political confrontation with China. In addition, U.S. allies also fear getting caught up in a conflict between China and the U.S. that does not directly involve them.66 However, it must be noted that although it is difficult for the United States to directly deploy land-based intermediate-range missiles in allied bases, it could still push allies to produce intermediate-range missiles and other precision-guided weapons through technical cooperation. Although U.S. allies want the technology more than the weapons themselves, for the United States, technology transfers are just a tactic to win over allies or prevent them from developing their own technologies. It is difficult for the United States to transfer core and cutting-edge technologies to its allies and this goes completely against the fundamental interests of U.S. arms dealers who hope to make huge profits by selling arms. Therefore, in the context of this so-called technological cooperation, new contradictions will also arise between the United States and its allies."
An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022","In addition, the strategic perceptions of Asia-Pacific countries with regard to China differ from that of the United States and they deviate from the United States in their China policies. This will affect how closely these countries will follow the strategy of the United States.67 Even if allies and partners agree to deepen defense cooperation with the United States due to its coercion and inducements, these countries may also maintain only limited defense partnerships with the United States on the surface and send symbolic contradictory signals to its population. However, such countries will not take practical actions to confront China in full accordance with the wishes of the United States and will be even less willing to invest too much money to accelerate the development of military modernization.68"

An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022","In fact, the U.S. military has exposed some of its intrinsic shortcomings or deficiencies in the planning of its deterrence by denial against China. The U.S. military believes that military bases with fixed locations will be the main target of the opponent’s first round of strikes, so its deterrent force must rely on bases with more remote locations or missiles with longer ranges and stronger penetration capabilities launched by various platforms. However, there are not many air and naval bases and they can be easily targeted. Although land-based intermediate-range missiles can partially fill the shortfall in denial capability, they are limited in number and can only effectively strike certain types of targets, such as ships. Although as underwater launch platforms, submarines have greater survivability, they carry limited ammunition and cannot be easily reloaded in a battlefield environment. Only surface ships that carry a large amount of missiles and have high flexibility can carry out various tasks such as anti-missile, anti-ship, and even ground strikes. They are the backbone of the U.S. military presence in the Western Pacific region. However, the U.S. Navy is currently plagued by problems such as the insufficient number of capital ships, slow reform of the fleet structure, and weakened support capabilities. At the theater level, issues such as a lack of training and logistical pressures continue to plague the Indo-Pacific Command. Philip Davidson, the former commander of the Indo-Pacific Command, bluntly stated that problems such as high operational requirements, slow maintenance, a single training channel, and the lack of reserve reinforcements have limited the Indo-Pacific Command’s response capabilities.69 Therefore, although U.S. Indo-Pacific security commitments and new military concepts are constantly being updated, the improvement of the denial capability requires a longer-term process, and the balancing capabilities of the U.S. military in the region are still weak."
An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022","In this context, the different branches of the U.S. military are very likely to become enmeshed in heated debates in the process of building up denial forces for deterrence against China according to their respective development plans. The U.S. Navy is a core member of the builders of deterrence against China. With the support of a relatively ample budget, in order to make up for shortcomings, the U.S. Navy launched a new instructive version of the “30-year Shipbuilding Plan” in 2020. However, once the plan is implemented, in the future, the U.S. military will have to cut funding for other services such as the Army and troops stationed abroad to pay for the Navy’s significantly increased shipbuilding costs.70 If the budgets of other services are cut due to the shipbuilding plan, this will inevitably produce conflicts between the services, and the battle over military spending that has gone on for many years will intensify. The Navy’s cost-saving plan still involves a complex game between the different parties, and the U.S. DoD has been internally looking for alternative solutions to reflect the needs of the new national defense strategy and fleet structure, but there is still a great deal of uncertainty about these plans."

They claimed to have mastered the integration process of the entire kill chain and that the Army should avoid duplication. However, the Army and the Marine Corps will never sit on the sidelines. Army Chief of Staff James McConville has repeatedly argued for the important role of the Army in regional conflicts on the grounds of responding to the “China threat” and wants to work with the Marine Corps to test new combat methods. With relatively limited defense expenditures, competing for the initiative in denial capability building has become an important way for the various services of the U.S. military to compete for funding. This puts the Air Force and the Navy in a more favorable situation with respect to the Army and the Marine Corps, but in order to ensure their own budget and status, the Army and the Marine Corps will continue to compete for greater shares of the budget through new technologies or new tactics. The resulting inter-service conflicts and disputes with regard to key military capabilities will also continue to play out."

An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022","As an important part of denial force construction, the development of missile defense systems is increasingly becoming an expensive task with huge challenges. The U.S. Missile Defense Agency’s five-year plan (FY2018–FY2023) has a budget of U.S. $46.7 billion, which is U.S. $13.7 billion more than the five-year plan during the Obama years.71 On March 28, 2022, the Biden administration submitted a defense budget request for FY 2023 totaling $813.3 billion to Congress. In this budget, the total budget request for missile defense reached U.S. $24.7 billion72, a huge increase of 20% over the previous fiscal year. Although the budget has reached a record high, Indo-Pacific Command still hopes that the DoD will increase investment in the development and deployment of air and missile defense systems in the Western Pacific region. However, many of the Missile Defense Agency’s budget requests have been rejected by Congress on the grounds that they need to be re-evaluated. The FY 2021 National Defense Authorization Act plans to allocate $76.8 million for the land-based “Aegis” system in Guam. However, Congress ultimately decided to cut these funds and called for a study of Guam’s defensive value.73 In addition, the DoD’s Office of Cost and Program Evaluation (CAPE) and Office of Net Assessment also opposed Indo-Pacific Command’s “Defend Guam” plan. They believe that China’s long-range missiles do not represent a sufficient threat to Guam and stress that the DoD should deploy troops based on military realities."

The continued worsening of these problems will also aggravate the concerns and dissatisfaction of the U.S. political community with the slow progress of military force construction and intensify the conflicts between them and military leaders on issues such as budget applications and military development plans."

An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022","The United States’ understanding and application of its deterrence by denial strategy have already broken out of the mold of the traditional defense-oriented deterrence by denial model. Its ideological root lies in the concept of “absolute security.” On the one hand, this is determined by the superior geographical location of the United States. During the Cold War, the U.S. strategy of deterrence by denial led to passive defense measures such as local civil defense construction and missile silo reinforcement with the aim of minimizing the damage caused by a Soviet nuclear strike and preserving its own nuclear force. After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the United States was no longer subject to any large-scale military threats from sovereign states. Therefore, the United States shifted the practice of its deterrence by denial strategy from its homeland to overseas, where it seeks to limit the threat to the homeland or even the territories of allies based on the idea of forward defense. On the other hand, the United States, as the global hegemon, has always claimed that it has the responsibility and obligation to protect the security of allies and deter potential adversaries. In fact, this constitutes its self-defined security frontier. This geopolitical conception of the United States incorporates its “dominant position” in the security order in the Western Pacific into its global hegemony. Although the United States must carefully consider intervention on the Asian mainland, especially military intervention, due to different situations, the principle of the United States has always been that it will never allow the powers on the Asian mainland to challenge its control.76 Accordingly, the United States’ deterrence by denial against China is actually carried out under the banner of “maintaining regional military security and balance,” ignoring China’s core interests and seeking its own rapid military expansion to ensure absolute control over the regional situation and escalation options."
An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022","The strategic stability between China and the United States is inherently a series of complex disputes. After Trump took office, there were still some contradictions in the U.S. strategic attitude towards China.77 In recent years, the United States has increasingly sought to draw China into nuclear arms control negotiations based on geopolitical interests, but has not acknowledged the de facto strategic stability relationship between the two countries.78 However, China is also continuously strengthening its strategic forces and building capabilities and is seeking strategic dialogue with the United States through multiple platforms to discuss crisis management and conflict de-escalation measures. Therefore, from the perspective of global nuclear stability, there is a relatively fragile strategic stability between China and the United States. However, the development of many deterrence by denial methods by the United States in recent years, such as the development of intermediate-range missiles, anti-missile systems, strategic anti-submarine capabilities, and space interception, has affected China’s second nuclear strike capability, which in turn has had a substantial impact on China’s nuclear deterrence capability."
An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022","Based on the asymmetry of strategic power between China and the United States, since the Trump administration, the United States has, from a perspective of technical analysis, taken strategic opportunism as its guide for weakening China’s strategic power. Strategic opportunism is a means of suppressing the nuclear retaliatory capabilities of medium-level nuclear countries on the basis of the relatively close proximity of comprehensive national strength, with the aim to seize favorable opportunities to achieve maximum strategic interests.79 In order to ensure its own second-strike capability, a large part of China’s land-based missiles with both nuclear and conventional capabilities are launched from mobile road-based platforms.80 However, during the launch process, the launch vehicle must be in a fixed position, at which time it is most vulnerable. Because of this short window of vulnerability, the attacking weapon must either be very close to the target or very fast. Considering that the flight speed of the various types of intermediate-range missiles currently developed by the United States is above Mach 3, if the United States deploys land-based intermediate missiles in a forward position, it will pose a huge threat to China’s second-strike capability With the rapid development of emerging U.S. military technologies in recent years, its intelligence collection, reconnaissance, surveillance, and precision strike capabilities have rapidly improved, improving the effectiveness of the U.S. in implementing damage limitation on China.81 The United States has been developing technology that can track missiles at all times, aiming to facilitate a shift from purely combat mechanisms to early denial operations. With the formation of a resilient space system and the extensive application of AI technology in multi-intelligence fusion analysis, it is possible for the United States to achieve real-time target tracking of missiles and their vehicles. If coupled with increasingly mature booster and mid-stage interception technologies, China’s nuclear counterattack capability is likely to be severely weakened in the future. As a result, the balance of strategic stability will also tip to the U.S. side, which is very dangerous for China.82"

This will force the adversary to take the effectiveness of denial into its judgment of benefits. Following from this, it is extremely important to roll out a deterrence by denial network in front of the opponent. For the United States, relying on front-line allies is a good way to maintain the long-term effectiveness of its deterrence by denial against China. To this end, the United States goes as far as to deliberately create security dilemmas among countries in the region. The “THAAD” incident is an example. As Chinese scholars have said, the most realistic issue with the introduction of “THAAD” into South Korea is to force China to prioritize South Korea and other U.S. allies in the Asia-Pacific region, which undermines strategic mutual trust and cooperation between China and South Korea.83 The U.S. deployment of the “THAAD” system in South Korea has partially transformed into a driving force for maintaining the U.S.-South Korea alliance, driving a spiraling escalation in the security dilemma between China and South Korea in a short period of time. A report by the Congressional Research Service pointed out that the United States uses missile defense systems to strengthen alliances, protect allies and partners, and force American allies into a position where they must confront China (转而必须对付中国).84 In the process of deploying denial capabilities in the Western Pacific region, the United States adopts a tough attitude towards China, which not only directly causes Sino-U.S. relations to deteriorate, but also, by affecting the relationships between China and neighboring countries, indirectly strengthens the pattern of confrontation between China and the United States and increases the difficulty of crisis management between China and the United States."

This indicates that the technological proliferation carried out by the United States in the Indo-Pacific region and its military cooperation with allies will continue to deepen for a long period of time in the future, and the incentive for allies to cooperate with the United States may further increase. At the same time, there is insufficient willingness to manage the risks arising from the proliferation of emerging technologies. Accordingly, the conventional arms race in the Asia-Pacific region is likely to further intensify, which also adds more variables to China’s efforts to jointly manage the risk of conflicts with neighboring countries."

In the process of strategic stability formation during the Cold War, this political compromise between the United States and the Soviet Union, represented by a series of strategic arms control treaties in the 1970s, ultimately played a key role. Today, if the U.S. strategy of deterrence by denial against China is to be truly effective, a major theoretical problem is how to avoid overly aggravating China while strengthening its own denial force construction and security commitment to its allies. However, at present, the United States has constantly emphasized the denial capability and force construction, overly emphasized the security protection of its allies or constraining allies to cooperate in denial against China, treated China’s regional security concerns in a negative manner, or even exerted coercion against China. As a result, the “deterrence” effect of its deterrence strategy will inevitably fade."
An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022","The U.S.-Japan alliance is an example. Japan shares common interests with the United States on the issue of balancing China and tries to benefit from regional frictions by strengthening U.S.-Japan security cooperation. However, there is a clear asymmetry in the interests of the two parties.86 On the one hand, the United States wants to avoid crossing the threshold to trigger a missile attack on China if at all possible and will make all efforts to avoid an escalation in the conflict with China. 87 On the other hand, Japan must effectively reduce the possibility of a missile attack on its homeland and require the United States to intervene as soon as possible. In view of this contradiction, Japan once questioned the reliability of the United States in the so-called “containment of China’s rise” and the necessity of joining a balancing alliance. To solidify its security commitments, the United States has turned to highlighting the need for deterrence by denial capabilities represented by missile defense cooperation. With U.S. support, Japan has accelerated its pursuit of a comprehensive deterrence by denial capability.88 A direct consequence of this is an increase in the possibility of Japan interfering in regional security affairs, especially Taiwan Strait affairs, in the name of “exercising the right of collective self-defense.” On the surface, this looks like a move by the United States to fulfill its security commitments to Japan, but in fact it indulges Japanese involvement in regional security affairs for the purpose of better cooperation with the United States in “intimidation.” However, this aggravates the risk of escalating confrontation in the Western Pacific region."

The deep purpose of U.S. deterrence by denial against China is to use all military deterrence means other than the direct deployment of troops to deter China from achieving complete reunification and consolidating its military dominance in the Western Pacific region. However, the actual situation is that the more China is confronted by military intimidation by the United States and its cooperation with allies, the more likely it is to intensify efforts to build up military capabilities and strive to break out of this military intimidation, thus making it difficult for the United States to achieve its desired effect of the deterrence by denial that it is working extremely hard for. This is the greatest paradox inherent in the United States’ forward deployment of deterrence by denial in the Indo-Pacific region and it will inevitably lead to the ultimate failure of Us deterrence by denial against China."

An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022","Judging from the recommendations of the American strategic academic community, the main strategic texts of the United States, and the practices of the Trump administration and the Biden administration in recent years, deterrence by denial has become the preferred option for U.S. military strategy and its military containment of China. The U.S. strategy of deterrence by denial is guided by the concept of “absolute security” and is already very different from the traditional deterrence by denial that focuses on defense. What the United States calls regional defense is in fact obviously offensive. The U.S. military mainly relies on itself and its allies to strengthen forward defense and deploy a precision strike network along the “first island chain” and to configure an integrated anti-missile system and optimize reserve forces in the “second island chain,” so as to maintain a distributed force posture in the Western Pacific region to comprehensively control the regional situation. The fundamental goals of the U.S. strategy of deterrence by denial against China are to prevent China from launching any military action that the United States sees as a threat to its regional dominance and to maintain the overall advantages of the United States from technology to equipment to combat systems by improving and reshaping the backbone forces of deterrence by denial."
An Analysis of the United States’ Deterrence by Denial Strategy Against China,"Journal of International Security Studies , Chen Xi , Ge Tengfei","Sep 16, 2022","At present, China must actively cultivate a favorable environment for the development of its military power, develop new technologies and equipment, respond to the military coercion arising from the United States’ practice of deterrence by denial against China, and reduce various actual or potential strategic risks. China must accurately grasp the changes in national security and military struggles, pay close attention to changes in technology, warfare, and opponents, and effectively break open the U.S. strategy of deterrence of denial in the process of building a strong military with Chinese characteristics. China must take multiple measures to prevent the United States from enhancing key denial capabilities in the area surrounding China, especially the anti-missile defense network. To the greatest extent possible, the Chinese and U.S. militaries should use existing platforms to effectively transmit information and prevent misjudgments."

According to the conception of the mainland’s “One Country, Two Systems” principle, Taiwan will enjoy a high degree of autonomy after the peaceful reunification of the two sides of the Strait. 1 Judging from the practice of the “One Country, Two Systems” policy in Hong Kong, the institutional design centered around this high degree of autonomy is undoubtedly a top priority of the Taiwan formula. In order to construct a complete and sound institutional design, a fundamental question that must be answered is this: what is the nature of the autonomy of post-peaceful-reunification Taiwan’s high degree of autonomy? The different answers to this question will directly affect the power relations between the central government and Taiwan after the peaceful reunification of the two sides of the Strait, and directly affect the scope and extent to which the central government can govern Taiwan."

Some scholars have formed two different viewpoints in their discussions of the nature of the autonomy enjoyed by Taiwan after peaceful reunification: delegated autonomy (授权性自治权说) and shared-power autonomy (分权性自治权说) [translator’s note: the latter can also be translated as ‘separation-of-powers autonomy’]."

Most of the institutional design and thinking on the “One Country, Two Systems” model for Taiwan do not deviate from the prototype of the Hong Kong and Macao model, except in that Taiwan enjoys a higher degree of autonomy or administrative status. 2 For example, Yu Keli pointed out that “our policy to solve the Taiwan issue can be more relaxed than the policy to resolve the Hong Kong issue, and the Taiwan model of ‘One Country, Two Systems’ should be better than today’s Hong Kong model.” 3 Su Ge pointed out that “after the peaceful reunification of Taiwan and the mainland of the motherland, Taiwan compatriots will not only enjoy all the political rights and interests provided by the Hong Kong and Macao model, but Taiwanese people can also come to the mainland of the motherland to assume leadership positions in national political institutions.” 4 Wang Weixing also pointed out that “under the conditions of ‘One Country, Two Systems,’ although Taiwan is essentially a local government in a unitary state structure, its authority will be greater than that of the provinces on the mainland of the motherland, as well as the authority of the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions.” 5 According to this reasoning, the specific form of implementation of “One Country, Two Systems” in Taiwan is an upgraded or expanded version of the Hong Kong and Macao model, which is a “quantitative” rather than a “qualitative” difference. The autonomy enjoyed by Taiwan, like the autonomy of Hong Kong and Macao, is still a delegated autonomy."

However, this conception positions Taiwan within the structural form of a unitary system. 7 In other words, the autonomy enjoyed by Taiwan after peaceful reunification would be a delegated autonomy."

She pointed out that: “the two systems in ‘One Country, Two Systems’ can also refer to a unitary system and a federal system. As long as there is the practical and theoretical possibility, the principles of ‘One Country, Two Systems’ and ‘one China’ do not exclude the realization of national unity through federalism. … In their research on ‘One Country, Two Systems,’ some scholars are often eager to draw a clear dividing line between ‘One Country, Two Systems’ and federalism, and even hastily dismiss federalism. On the one hand, this reflects a misunderstanding of federalism, and on the other hand, it stems from rigid thinking on the form of state structures.” 9 According to Wang Liping’s point of view, the possibility that post-reunification Taiwan could enjoy shared-power autonomy cannot be ruled out."
An Attempt to Discuss the Nature of Taiwan’s High Degree of Autonomy After Peaceful Reunification: Based on the Practical Experience of Hong Kong,"Taiwan Studies , Wu Libin","Feb 20, 2022","Professor Wang Yingjin of Renmin University of China may have been the first scholar to explicitly propose the idea of shared-power autonomy. He proposed: “acknowledge or recognize that the power that Taiwan is currently holding and exercising is original power (本源性权力) (that is, the right to exercise sovereignty) inherent in its 23 million people. On this basis, through negotiation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, the Taiwan side hands over to the central government that part of its right to exercise sovereignty which can reflect national unity (such as diplomatic power). The remaining part that has not been handed over will be retained by the Taiwan side as ‘residual power.’ In other words, the ‘sharing of powers’ is implemented between the central government and Taiwan at the level of original power, rather than the ‘delegation of power’ by the central government to Taiwan at the level of derivative power. That is, through some legal method, letting Taiwan enjoy shared-power autonomy rather than the delegated autonomy enjoyed by Hong Kong and Macao. After the principle of federal separation of powers is implemented between the central government and the Taiwan Special Administrative Region, the relationship between the central government and the Taiwan Special Administrative Region will no longer be a central-local relationship in the general sense, nor a relationship between a center and another center in the sense of the federation as a whole and its member units, but a relationship between a center and a ‘quasi-center’.” 10"

In terms of fundamental nature, the relationship of Hong Kong and Macao with the central government is still within the framework of a unitary system. The amount of power granted by the central government to a special administrative region is entirely at the discretion of the central government, and the central government is fully able to change the power of the special administrative region through unilateral constitutional amendments or legislation, or even to completely change the special administrative region’s system.” “Concerns and fears about this possibility are precisely the root cause of Taiwan resistance to the Hong Kong and Macao model of ‘One Country, Two Systems’ and its expanded version.” “The Taiwan model of ‘One Country, Two Systems’ will inevitably introduce some features of federalism.” 12 It can be seen that the above thesis does not accept the view that the autonomy enjoyed by Taiwan after peaceful reunification is a delegated autonomy, but holds that this kind of autonomy should by nature be a shared-power autonomy."

If this autonomy is shared-power autonomy, then the central government and Taiwan are in a separation of powers relationship. The fundamental difference between the two is: in the relationship between delegator and delegatee, the power of the central government is inherent, original, and can be said to be unlimited, and the power of the locality is derived, originates from the delegation of power by the central government, and is limited, with the “residual power” belonging to the central government. A separation of powers relationship is the opposite. Local power is inherent, original, and unlimited.

An Attempt to Discuss the Nature of Taiwan’s High Degree of Autonomy After Peaceful Reunification: Based on the Practical Experience of Hong Kong,"Taiwan Studies , Wu Libin","Feb 20, 2022","It is unrealistic to enumerate the allocation of central and local powers in a single law. Among the reasons for this is that law itself can, by nature, lag behind whereas practice develops, and as practice develops new power allocations are needed. The fundamental difference between the impact of delegated autonomy and that of shared-power autonomy on central power is: due to the development of practice, when local governments face new situations and legal provisions are unclear or lacking, does the central government have the power to intervene? In short, does the “residual power” belong to the central or the local government? According to the two different theories presented above, if the autonomy enjoyed by the locality is delegated autonomy, then the central government certainly has the right to intervene because the “residual power” belongs to the center. However, if the autonomy enjoyed by the locality is shared-power autonomy, then the center has no power to intervene because the “residual power” belongs to the locality. Then, when the “One Country, Two Systems” policy faces special or emergency situations in the process of its practice in Taiwan, and the legal provisions are unclear or lacking, should the central government’s right to intervene be retained? Here, we may first examine the situation of the practice of the “One Country, Two Systems” policy in Hong Kong."

We must look at whether these interventions are beneficial to the interests of the people of Hong Kong, to the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, or whether they harm the interests of the people of Hong Kong and the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. … But do not think that there are no destructive forces. Such destructive forces may come from this side or that side. If unrest occurs, the central government will be required to intervene. If it turns chaos into order, should such an intervention be welcomed or rejected? It should be welcomed.” 18 In 1987, when Deng Xiaoping met with members of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Basic Law Drafting Committee, he re-emphasized this point: “Don’t ever think that if all Hong Kong’s affairs are administered by the people of Hong Kong while the central government handles nothing at all, all will be well. This would not work—the idea is not realistic. It is true that the center does not intervene in the specific affairs of the special administrative region, nor does it need to intervene. However, will there not be situations in the special administrative region that endanger the fundamental interests of the country? Can we be sure this will not happen? At such a time, should Beijing get involved or not? Is it conceivable that nothing will happen in Hong Kong that harms the fundamental interests of Hong Kong? Can we imagine that there will be no interference and no destructive forces in Hong Kong? I see no basis for such self-comfort. If the center were to abandon any and every power, this could give rise to some confusion and damage Hong Kong’s interests. Therefore, it is in the interests of Hong Kong that the center maintain certain powers.” 19 During the drafting stage of the Hong Kong Basic Law, drafting committee member Martin Lee Chu-ming and others proposed to expressly stipulate in the Basic Law that the powers exercised by the center and the powers other than those enjoyed by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, namely the “residual powers,” should be assigned to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. 20 This kind of opinion essentially advocates that Hong Kong should enjoy “shared-power autonomy,” but the Basic Law did not adopt this view."

It has twice been rejected due to obstruction by the opposition in the Legislative Council. 22 The Hong Kong opposition is particularly dissatisfied with Article 45, paragraph 2 of the Basic Law regarding nominations by the nominating committee, and further proposed that nominations should be made directly by voters or by political parties. In December 2013, the Hong Kong SAR government launched a consultation on the third political reform, but met resistance from the radical opposition.

They try to turn the Legislative Council into a base for opposition against the leadership of the executive. They even advocate Hong Kong independence, ultimately targeting the center and its authority to govern Hong Kong. 23 Faced with the actions of the opposition to seize power, the SAR government was no longer able to cope on its own. At that time, the central government had no choice but to intervene; and it had to intervene. In April 2004, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress passed the Interpretation by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress Regarding Annex I (7) and Annex II (III) to the ‘Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China,’ which stipulated that Hong Kong’s political reform must go through a “five-step process”: The Chief Executive submits a report to the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on whether amendments are required–The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress makes a decision–The SAR Government proposes an amendment bill to the Legislative Council and the bill is approved through a two-thirds majority of all members of the Legislative Council–The Chief Executive gives consent–The bill is approved or filed by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress.

In March 2019, before the outbreak of the “Amendment Bill” turmoil, the U.S. National Security Council invited Anson Chan, Dennis Kwok Wing-hang, and Charles Mok to visit the United States. They were successively received by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and House Speaker Pelosi. Anson Chan and others publicly requested that the United States interfere in Hong Kong affairs. 26 In May, Martin Lee Chu-ming went to the United States to seek support from Secretary of State Pompeo and Speaker of the House Pelosi. 27 After the “Amendment Bill” turmoil broke out in June, Jimmy Lai Chee-ying visited the United States in July and met with U.S. Vice President Pence, Secretary of State Pompeo, and a number of Republican senators. 28 As the “Amendment Bill” turmoil intensified, officials from the U.S. consulate in Hong Kong met with Anson Chan, Martin Lee Chu-ming, Joshua Wong Chi-fung, and Nathan Law Kwun-chung, giving them advice in person. 29 And this is just the information obtained from public reports."
An Attempt to Discuss the Nature of Taiwan’s High Degree of Autonomy After Peaceful Reunification: Based on the Practical Experience of Hong Kong,"Taiwan Studies , Wu Libin","Feb 20, 2022","The lack of a legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security in Hong Kong has given “anti-China and chaotic Hong Kong” elements and external forces an opportunity they could use for their purposes. As a result, various activities in Hong Kong that endanger national security have intensified, and national security and Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability have faced serious threats. Therefore, in a situation wherein it was difficult to predict when Hong Kong might complete local legislation on national security, it was imperative and was the only option that the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for Hong Kong to safeguard national security be established and improved at the national level. On May 28, 2020, the Third Plenum of the Thirteenth National People’s Congress voted to pass The Decision of the National People’s Congress on Establishing and Improving the Legal System and Enforcement Mechanisms for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to Safeguard National Security. On June 30, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress passed the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, which was included in Annex III of the Hong Kong Basic Law and announced and implemented in Hong Kong. In July of the same year, the Central People’s Government established the Office for Safeguarding National Security in Hong Kong. The SAR government has also established the “Committee for Safeguarding National Security of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region” and the “National Security Department of the Police Force.”"

Hong Kong has achieved a major transition “from chaos to governance.” 30 In addition to the two typical cases presented above, there have been many other situations in the practice of the “One Country, Two Systems” policy in Hong Kong that were resolved or subsided only after intervention from the center. For example, in 1999, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress first interpreted the relevant provisions of the Hong Kong Basic Law to correct the biased judgment of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal on the “Ng Ka-ling case.”31 In 2017, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress made a decision that the “co-location” arrangement of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link at the West Kowloon Station was in line with the principle of “One Country, Two Systems” and the fundamental purpose of the Hong Kong Basic Law. This resolved the long-standing controversy over “co-location” in Hong Kong society. Examples are aplenty."

Second, it has maintained the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. However, the practice of the “One Country, Two Systems” policy in Hong Kong has also shown that, as something completely new, “One Country, Two Systems,” had no precedent to follow and would inevitably face some deep-seated problems and serious challenges. Looking at the practical experience of Hong Kong, we can imagine that if the autonomy enjoyed by Hong Kong were to have been shared-power autonomy, the power of the center would be limited to a few items explicitly listed in the Hong Kong Basic Law, and at times when new situations arose in Hong Kong which the SAR government could not deal with or resolve by itself, the center would have no right to intervene. The consequences would not only damage Hong Kong’s own prosperity and stability, but also have a negative impact on national sovereignty, security, and development interests."

The “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula cannot be blindly copied from the Hong Kong formula. The “One Country, Two Systems” policy was proposed to solve the Taiwan issue, but it was first put into practice in Hong Kong. This reflects the nature of the practice in Hong Kong as a “test field.” Comrade Deng Xiaoping once pointed out: “Whether the reunification of the mainland and Taiwan can truly be smoothly achieved depends first on the result of the realization of ‘One Country, Two Systems’ in Hong Kong, and second on whether our economy can truly develop. The key for China to solve all its problems is that it must rely on its own development.” 32 Therefore, the practical experience of “One Country, Two Systems” in Hong Kong should serve as an important reference for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula."
An Attempt to Discuss the Nature of Taiwan’s High Degree of Autonomy After Peaceful Reunification: Based on the Practical Experience of Hong Kong,"Taiwan Studies , Wu Libin","Feb 20, 2022","The Taiwan issue and cross-strait reunification are no less complicated than the return of Hong Kong to the motherland. Observing things from the perspective of the current social sentiment and public opinion on the island of Taiwan, the “Taiwan independence” separatist forces have long been tilling the soil in Taiwanese society. Public opinion on the island is deeply influenced by the separatist ideology of “Taiwan independence,” “One Country, Two Systems” has long been stigmatized in Taiwan, and Taiwanese society is quite resistant to “One Country, Two Systems.” Relatively speaking, “Hong Kong independence” has not risen to the same level of popularity in Hong Kong society, and the “One Country, Two Systems” policy is generally accepted by the people of Hong Kong. Moreover, what is fairly certain is that, after the peaceful reunification of the two sides of the Strait, the “Taiwan independence” forces will not automatically retreat, the consciousness of “Taiwan independence” will not automatically disappear, external forces will not give up on interfering in Taiwan’s affairs, and other unforeseen new developments may occur. From this, it can be further inferred that the comprehensive and accurate implementation of the “One Country, Two Systems” policy in Taiwan will face a greater number of more complicated and thorny issues than in Hong Kong. For example, how can we dissolve the “Taiwan independence” forces and eliminate the influence of “Taiwan independence” consciousness as quickly as possible? How can we form mainstream public opinion in favor of and supportive of the “One Country, Two Systems” policy as quickly as possible? How can we ensure that the authority to govern Taiwan does not fall into the hands of “Taiwan independence” elements? How can we improve Taiwan compatriots’ national identification with China? And how can we effectively prevent and constrain external forces from interfering in Taiwan affairs? This series of foreseeable problems along with some unforeseeable ones demand that the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula carries out a more finely detailed, more prudent institutional design regarding the power allocation model between the center and Taiwan. While establishing Taiwan’s high degree of autonomy, it must retain flexible space for central power."

This lack of flexibility could result in a situation where Taiwan desperately needs intervention from the center, but the center has no right to intervene. The young scholar Mao Qimeng has raised doubts and concerns about the theory of shared-power autonomy, pointing out: “With regard to the cross-strait political arrangement under the special circumstances pertaining before national reunification or to the ultimate building of the ‘One Country, Two Systems’ Taiwan model, a power sharing arrangement based on a separation of powers may still require some debate. Because a ‘separation of powers’ which has the flavor of federalism or confederation provides the Taiwan authorities with the ‘factual’ conditions or even a ‘jurisprudential’ basis for an ‘original separation of powers,’ it is also the core goal of the Taiwan authorities’ pursuit of a long-term ‘form of shared power,’ and on a fundamental level this violates the principle of popular sovereignty under which Taiwan’s future and destiny should be commonly determined by all Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.” 33"

Here we can borrow from the words of Comrade Deng Xiaoping cited above: is it really conceivable that post-peaceful-reunification Taiwan will have no destructive forces? Is it conceivable that nothing will happen to harm the fundamental interests of the nation? Is it conceivable that nothing will happen that harms the fundamental interests of Taiwan? At such time, should Beijing get involved or not? Therefore, it is in the interests of Taiwan that certain powers of the center be maintained."

Here, it remains necessary to further discuss and explore the theory of shared-power autonomy from the perspectives of a unitary system and a federal system. The essence of the view that a peacefully reunified Taiwan will enjoy shared-power autonomy is that it advocates the introduction of certain features of federalism into the power allocation model of the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula. This view holds that “due to historical reasons, the Taiwan authorities are exercising some powers that should no longer be exercised by them, which makes it difficult to peacefully resolve the Taiwan issue through a reunification model based on a unitary system.” 34 Therefore, some features of a federal system must be introduced into the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan model. 35 This view further holds that, after the introduction of the features of federalism, Taiwan will transfer some original powers to the center, and the remaining original powers that it has not transferred will belong to Taiwan as “residual power.” 36 In other words, the theory of shared-power autonomy necessarily links federalism with the sharing of power from the local to the center, and the “residual power” belonging to the local government. However, this understanding is one-sided and misunderstands federalism."

Most countries in the world adopt the form of a unitary state. A unitary system refers to a form of state structure where, in the process of the vertical allocation and application of the right to exercise state power, the central government alone enjoys all sovereign powers and regional governments share the right to exercise other state powers. 37 The authority of local government in a unitary state is entrusted to it by the central government, and the local government must obey the leadership of the center and accept its supervision. 38 The fundamental feature of a unitary system is that, whether in terms of authority, public interest, or public finances, the highest and most fundamental decision-making power is put in the hands of the central government, and the powers which local governments share are only subordinate powers underneath these powers.39"

Neither side can unilaterally alter the constitutional power-sharing arrangement. 41 A federal state has both a federal or central government (legislature and executive bodies) and a number of state or local legislative bodies and governments. Both the federal and state governments derive their powers from the federal constitution, and both enjoy supreme authority in specific areas. 42 In terms of legislative power, a federal system is a constitutional regime in which the central legislature and the legislatures of the states or territorial units that make up the federation share legislative power. 43"
An Attempt to Discuss the Nature of Taiwan’s High Degree of Autonomy After Peaceful Reunification: Based on the Practical Experience of Hong Kong,"Taiwan Studies , Wu Libin","Feb 20, 2022","The fundamental difference between a unitary system and a federal system is whether sovereign power is exclusively held by the central government or shared by the central government and regional governments. In a unitary system, the central government exclusively holds sovereign power. In a federal system, the central government shares sovereign power with the regional governments. 44 A unitary state does not preclude the possibility of local or other government agencies having powers entrusted or delegated to them by the central government. However, this power must be entrusted or delegated by the central government; it is not allocated. In a strict legal sense, all powers belong to the central government.45"
An Attempt to Discuss the Nature of Taiwan’s High Degree of Autonomy After Peaceful Reunification: Based on the Practical Experience of Hong Kong,"Taiwan Studies , Wu Libin","Feb 20, 2022","Sovereign power is clearly a type of original power. In view of the concepts of, and differences between, unitary and federal systems presented above, to whom original power belongs becomes a key factor in distinguishing between unitary and federal systems. However, in terms of the original ownership of original power, which method a federal state adopts is not fixed. That is, federal states do not absolutely implement a “bottom-up” method from the local to the center. In fact, in terms of the original ownership of original power in federal states, there are three forms: the first is that of countries like the United States and Switzerland, where original power originally belongs to the states, and the power of the federation is granted it by the states. In other words, the original power of states is the “source,” and the original power of the federation “flows” to it from this source. This is a type of local to central sharing of power. In the second form, the original power originally belongs to a unified state, and it is only in order to better solve ethnic problems, problems of unbalanced economic development, or other specific problems that the unitary system is abandoned in favor of a federal system. That is, the original power of the federation is the “source,” and the original power of federation member units “flows” from this source. This is central to local sharing of power. The Russian Federation and the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are examples of this form. The third form is a hybrid of the first and second forms, such as that of the former Soviet Union; or where the original ownership of the original power is, for various reasons, very hazy, such as in Canada, Australia, India, and Pakistan, where it is difficult to convincingly determine the ownership of original power. 46"

There is not just one form of federalism. It can be divided into several forms, such as federalism based on the separation of powers and checks and balances, federalism based on democratic centralism, autonomous democratic federalism, centralized federalism, and so on. 47 Federalism based on the separation of powers and checks and balances is a fairly typical federal system. Federalism based on the separation of powers and checks and balances uses horizontal separation of powers (separation of executive, legislative, and judicial powers) and vertical separation of powers (separation of powers between the federation and federal member units) to realize checks and balances on power. The separation of powers is the precondition and basis of checks and balances. In the separation of powers between the federation and the federation member units, there are three methods of power separation: the first is to enumerate the powers of the federation in the constitution, with the member units generally retaining other powers, that is, the “residual powers” belong to the member units. Such federal states include the United States, Switzerland, Germany, and Mexico. The second is to enumerate the powers of each party in the constitution, with the powers that are not listed retained by the federation, that is, the “residual powers” belong to the federation. Canada and India have adopted this method. The third method is the type of separation of powers in the Russian Federation. According to the Constitution of the Russian Federation, the entities that make up the Russian Federation possess the “residual powers” outside of the jurisdiction of the federation and the common jurisdiction of the federation and its entities. However, due to the very broad language used by the Constitution to describe the exclusive powers of the federation and the common jurisdiction of the federation and its entities, there are very few “residual powers” that are actually exclusively held by the entities. 48"

The institutional design of the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula should fully draw on the practical experience from Hong Kong, maintain flexibility in power allocation, and maintain the power of the center to intervene in a timely and appropriate manner. However, the theory of shared-power autonomy is too rigid as regards the institutional design of central government power and lacks flexibility, which may lead to the central government having only extremely limited powers regarding the peacefully reunified Taiwan and make it unable to respond to, and deal with, new situations that may arise promptly and effectively. At the same time, the theory of shared-power autonomy contains misunderstandings about federalism and mechanically takes the federal model of the United States as the universal model of federal states around the world.

Analysis of Changes in Germany’s Perceptions of China,"Contemporary International Relations , Wang Shuo , Zhang Xiaoling","May 20, 2022","The new German “traffic light” government has been in power for half a year so far. Due to differences in the philosophies of the three major political parties in the coalition and the changing international situation, especially the intensifying conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Germany’s attitude toward China has become more confusing and ambiguous under the dual influence of domestic and foreign affairs. This deeply reflects the major changes that are appearing in perceptions of China within German mainstream society. Among German political, business, and academic circles, the mainstream media, and most of the general public, perceptions of China are different compared with the period when Angela Merkel was in power, in both breadth and depth. This will undoubtedly have an important impact on the German government’s repositioning of relations with China. Considering Germany’s central position in the EU, the readjustment of Sino-German relations will also directly affect the direction of China-EU relations. A rational and comprehensive analysis should be made of this, to both face the challenges it brings and see the inherent stability, and thereby avoid falling into the cognitive traps of pessimism and fatalism. Starting from the changes in German mainstream society’s perceptions of China in recent years, this paper seeks to analyze the multi-level reasons behind them and explore the possible positive factors, in order to help understand the German government’s policy adjustment toward China and the overall situation of China-EU relations."
Analysis of Changes in Germany’s Perceptions of China,"Contemporary International Relations , Wang Shuo , Zhang Xiaoling","May 20, 2022",I.
Analysis of Changes in Germany’s Perceptions of China,"Contemporary International Relations , Wang Shuo , Zhang Xiaoling","May 20, 2022","Since Angela Merkel took office in 2005, Germany has mainly regarded China as a partner and a competitor, especially after the short-lived “values diplomacy” from 2005 to 2009, and in its relations with China it has leaned toward its national interests. With China’s further rise, however, and especially since 2017, Germany’s policy toward China has begun to shift from national interests to the values end of the spectrum. With the release of the European Commission’s EU-China: A strategic outlook on March 12, 2019, Germany’s mainstream perception of China shifted from the original two-dimensional role to a “three-fold” role, that is, China is both a partner and a competitor of Germany, but also an institutional adversary.1 Specifically, Germany must cooperate with China in areas where cooperation is possible, compete with China for global resources in appropriate contexts, and be able to deal with conflict with China when necessary.2"
Analysis of Changes in Germany’s Perceptions of China,"Contemporary International Relations , Wang Shuo , Zhang Xiaoling","May 20, 2022","First, China is seen as a partner that cannot be decoupled from. According to German political scientist Hanns Maull, China’s role as a partner for Germany can be understood in two ways. First, Germany understands very well that China is an indispensable economic and trade partner. This can be seen from the ever-increasing interdependence in the economic and trade relationship between China and Germany in recent years. On one hand, the German economy is dependent on China. For example, the development of Germany’s electronics and chemical industries cannot do without rare earth metals from China.3 At the same time, China is Germany’s largest market for car sales: About 40 percent of German cars are sold to China. On the other hand, China’s exports to Germany are booming, with emerging electronics, communication technology, and consumer goods enterprises getting huge orders from Germany,4 while Chinese enterprises have long depended on Germany for technology transfers. Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, Sino-German economic cooperation has exhibited more pronounced interdependence. For example, Germany has purchased a large number of medical products from China, indicating that Germany’s dependence on the Chinese market has increased rather than decreased.5 The long-term win-win nature of Sino-German economic cooperation has solidified Germany’s perception of China as an indispensable economic partner. Second, Germany sees China as an important partner in global governance. Due to the importance of China today in the international community and a broad consensus on the “community of human destiny” in the international community, China has become an important partner with Germany in addressing important global issues such as climate change, transnational migration, nuclear weapons proliferation, artificial intelligence, poverty reduction, and public health. Germans are well aware that these important global issues cannot be solved without China. However, in terms of the perception of China as a mutually beneficial and important economic and trade partner for Germany, Germans are increasingly expressing a cautious and restrained attitude. This is because they are concerned that win-win outcomes for the two countries’ enterprises and economic policies could lead to confrontations over values outside the economic sphere. For example, Germans believe that every act of Sino-German economic cooperation advances the implementation of China’s economic strategy of military-civil fusion.6 On this point, Rolf Langhammer, a researcher at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, has warned in a survey study that German enterprises investing in China should not withdraw rashly from the Chinese market because such enterprises are already highly integrated into Chinese economic activity.7"
Analysis of Changes in Germany’s Perceptions of China,"Contemporary International Relations , Wang Shuo , Zhang Xiaoling","May 20, 2022","Second, China is increasingly seen as a strong economic competitor. Thomas Heck, a China expert at PricewaterhouseCoopers, says that in addition to the well-known artificial intelligence and Internet of Things industries, China as an economic rival poses an economic threat to Germany in two other areas: electric vehicles and, especially, machinery manufacturing. Although the Chinese machinery manufacturing industry does not have superiority in core technology, it already constitutes a strong competitor to German machinery manufacturing when quality and price factors are taken together.8 In addition, Chinese investors began to acquire a large number of German enterprises in 2016, and Germans increasingly feel that China is an economic rival that should not be underestimated. The most famous such case is the acquisition of German robotics giant Kuka Group by China’s Midea Group. Although the acquisition of German companies by Chinese enterprises is good for German jobs and the domestic market, Germans believe that in the long run there is a risk of losing core technology, which would have a negative impact on the competitiveness and innovation of German industry. Direct investments by Chinese enterprises in Germany have met with strenuous criticism from the German public. In 2018, Germany amended the Foreign Trade Ordinance to further strengthen security reviews of M&A by enterprises from non-EU countries. In December 2020, the German government ordered a halt to the acquisition of German radio technology company IMST GmbH by China Aerospace Science & Industry Corporation Limited (CASIC), arguing that it would threaten Germany’s future security and technological autonomy in mobile communications.9 At the same time, Germans have been reluctant to acknowledge the fact that things are not what they once were: Germany used to sell high-speed rail to China, but now China sells its own high-speed rail all over the world. They have even called on the federal government to restrict Chinese direct investment in Germany in order to prevent the loss of core German high-tech knowhow, citing the high degree of similarity between Chinese high-speed rail technology and related designs and Germany’s Intercity Express (ICE) trains.10 However, a report in the Der Volkswirt magazine on March 22, 2022 shows that despite the impact of the pandemic, Chinese enterprises have invested in or acquired up to 35 enterprises in Germany in 2022. Despite the fact that Chinese direct investment in Germany is something of a hot potato, they do not want Germany to lose its competitive advantage because of the loss of core technology, and view China as a “thorn in their side.” Nonetheless, they must acknowledge China’s strength as a powerful competitor.11"
Analysis of Changes in Germany’s Perceptions of China,"Contemporary International Relations , Wang Shuo , Zhang Xiaoling","May 20, 2022","Third, China has been elevated from a competitor to an institutional adversary. In the eyes of Germans, institutional adversaries are those who endorse other models of government, and they believe that China’s party system goes against the “universal values” of freedom, democracy, rule of law, and human rights preached by the West. When it comes to defending Western-centered “universal values,” Germans regard China to be an institutional adversary. Compared to the first two roles, the new government is putting greater emphasis on China’s role as Germany’s institutional adversary, more so than it did under Merkel. The Western world, including Germany, has always believed that China’s political system could be changed through improved economic relations, that is, Germany’s “change through trade” approach to China has been there all along.12 However, as China’s economic power strengthens, the growing tendency of Germans to believe that China plays the role of Germany’s “institutional adversary” is becoming clearer. In the eyes of Germans, China’s economic system is a socialist market economy with goals that are the complete opposite of those pursued by Germany’s social welfare market economy,13 and its political system emphasizes the centrality of the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. In fact, it is institutional advantages that are driving the realization of the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and China’s success in the fight against the COVID-19 epidemic has further highlighted these institutional advantages and attracted global attention. This has reinforced the German perception of China as a threat to Western democracy and a powerful “institutional adversary.”14 However, within this perception, different voices have emerged in German politics. For example, Rainer Stinner, a former federal councilor and parliamentary caucus foreign policy spokesman for Germany’s Free Democratic Party (FDP), stated frankly in a report that huge historical and cultural differences have led to differences in institutions and values between the West and China. Although he favors the West in the institutional competition between the West and China, he said that it would be inappropriate if Germany were to adhere to the Western view of human rights in defending its own interests.15"

Analysis of Changes in Germany’s Perceptions of China,"Contemporary International Relations , Wang Shuo , Zhang Xiaoling","May 20, 2022","The “three-fold” positioning reflects the current basic perceptions of the German political and business communities, intellectual elites, and the public towards China, and within it one can see Germany’s wavering attitude towards China. It also reflects the truly complex psychology of German society vis-a-vis China. There are many complex factors behind this contradictory, confusing, complicated, and tense relationship, which can be said to be due to changes and developments in Germany and China themselves, as well as the result of the influence of international power games, while traditional German thinking also plays an important role."
Analysis of Changes in Germany’s Perceptions of China,"Contemporary International Relations , Wang Shuo , Zhang Xiaoling","May 20, 2022","1. Changes in Germany’s domestic political ecology. The three-party “traffic light” coalition, which opened a new era in the politics of the Federal Republic of Germany since its founding, is the result of a game involving the diversified interests of the people and compromises in the political demands of political parties. It reflects the increasing instability and uncertainty of Germany’s internal politics and the fragmentation of the German political party landscape.16 Internal politics is a continuation of foreign affairs, and the division of domestic political forces has also helped bring about the changes in Germany’s perceptions of China and even its policy toward China. Judging from the political positions of the three major ruling parties in Germany, wherein the Social Democratic Party (SPD) is a center-left party, the Green Party (“the Greens”) is a left-wing party, and the FDP is a center-right party, the tension formed by the differences and similarities in the political positions of the three parties determines the multiple tensions among various influencing factors in the process of change in Germany’s perceptions of China. Firstly, the new government mentioned China 14 times in the coalition agreement17 and put forward its own ideas on Taiwan-related issues based on its values. For the first time, it explicitly called for further strengthening Germany’s “China competence.” Secondly, it further emphasizes Germany’s “three-fold” role positioning of China. For example, the Greens and the FDP have a strong ideological orientation, preferring to make a lot of noise about China’s human rights issues, opposing the signing of the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment. They even challenge the existing policy bottom line on the Taiwan issue occasionally, advocating greater participation of Taiwan in international affairs, and thus prefer to see China as a competitor and institutional adversary. In contrast, the SPD wants to maintain the continuity of its policy tone towards China. It wants to strengthen defenses against the growth of Chinese power, but also refuses to choose confrontation with China or economic decoupling. It is willing to treat China as a partner, and put that aspect at the forefront of the “three-fold” role.18 Thus, the SPD’s more moderate and pragmatic approach to China is forms a counterbalance to the relatively hard-line, values-oriented approach of the Greens and the FDP. The political positions within Germany’s ruling party coalition, which show clear-cut barriers in their attitudes toward China, have served to shape Germany’s domestic political environment and the environment for social discourse on China, and have brought greater diversification and complexity to perceptions of China within mainstream German society. Moreover, in today’s increasingly polarized and populist environment in the Western world, it is easier for German political elites to exploit and appeal to public sentiment to further their policy aims. In particular, the several waves in Germany of the COVID-19 epidemic that has ravaged the world since 2020 have accelerated political strife and polarization within Germany. Under such circumstances, Germany’s political elite have skillfully exploited these political conflicts and directed the accumulated grievances arising from them toward Germany’s international strategic adversaries, China first and foremost. This has also accelerated the shift in perceptions of China within Germany, from political elites to the public at large."
Analysis of Changes in Germany’s Perceptions of China,"Contemporary International Relations , Wang Shuo , Zhang Xiaoling","May 20, 2022","2. Difficulty adapting to China’s rapid rise. China used to be a partner that could be “helped,” but now with China’s development, Germans increasingly feel the relationship with China to be “unequal” and “unfamiliar,” and mainstream society has even started having more discussion about the “China threat theory.” Firstly, China’s creation of the China-Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) cooperation mechanism is seen by Germans as having generated intra-European tensions. German critics of this cooperation are concerned that growing dependence of CEE countries on China will create potential conflicts within the EU, affecting the EU’s core position. Germany is excluded from this cooperation mechanism, so in the eyes of Germans it is Chinese interference in the geopolitical space of European countries, and a deliberate attempt to undermine, divide, and dismantle the EU. Secondly, the Belt and Road Initiative construction proposed by China in 2013 is seen by Germany as a manifestation of China’s economic expansion. Huawei in particular is suspected by Germany of being a “Chinese spy” due to its technological superiority, and it was believed that Huawei would try to open a back door for so-called espionage and sabotage activities through its telecommunication products. This caused the German federal government to be torn constantly between the economic interests of infrastructure expansion on one hand and the security interests of core infrastructure and data protection on the other, and ultimately unable to make a rational decision.19 The direct result was that Huawei was ultimately unable to participate in the construction of Germany’s 5G network in 2020. As a result, German attitudes toward China shifted from “helpful” to “guarded,” and perceptions tended toward viewing China as an economic competitor. When emotional fear and defensiveness brought on by the rise of another country escalate to ideological hostility and confrontation, the country in question will be criticized as an ideological opponent, especially when the rising country, in order to build its own good international image, participates more actively in global governance, expresses its ideas on maintaining world peace, and shares the international public goods brought by its rise.20 For example, in 2021, China took the lead in global public health governance by cooperating with developing countries on vaccine production, providing nearly 2 billion doses of vaccines to more than 120 countries and international organizations, making it the largest foreign provider of vaccines.21 However, China’s proactive approach to global vaccine cooperation has been twisted by the German media into “vaccine diplomacy,” in which China uses vaccines to play the role of “savior of the world” in the international community.22 In this way, China’s rise has accelerated the evolution of German perceptions of China, from an “economic competitor” to a “values adversary.”"
Analysis of Changes in Germany’s Perceptions of China,"Contemporary International Relations , Wang Shuo , Zhang Xiaoling","May 20, 2022","3. The complex background of China-United States-Europe relations. Whether it is the “European Germany” emphasized during the Kohl era or the “German Europe” of the Merkel era, the changes in Germany’s perceptions of China are largely influenced by changes in Europe’s position in the international landscape, especially by the complex China-United States-Europe triangle. After Biden came to power, the United States readjusted its transatlantic partnership, and in order to hold on to its position as the world’s top power, it needs Europe to be its loyal ally and draw closer to it, and to maintain consistency with it in terms of China policy.23 According to a poll by the Körber Foundation in Germany, 56 percent of respondents believed Germany should have closer ties with the United States, while only 27 percent said they should become closer to China. The pro-U.S. political elite in Germany has also continued to emphasize that Germany ought to have greater prominence in the alliance with the United States, and be closer to the United States. European countries, represented by Germany, want to join forces with the United States to address the challenges posed by China’s rise, to stop China from strengthening further, and ultimately to win the economic and institutional competition.24 In fact, compared to the post-World War II recovery period, Europe’s dependence on the United States today is gradually falling, especially in the current tense pattern of China-U.S. competition, and Europe is constantly and actively seeking strategic autonomy in international affairs. That is to say, although the relationship between Europe and the United States has returned to the status of allies after Biden’s rise to power, Europe is not willing to choose only one side in the China-U.S. game, but rather chooses sides according to different issues, oscillating between China and the United States with an opportunistic, trader’s mentality, in order to profit from them.25 In other words, Europe is no longer willing to maintain an equidistant attitude between the United States, a flawed democracy, and China, a country with different values. As European Council President Charles Michel warned in 2020, Europe must become one of the global players, while avoiding becoming a playing field and a victim in the struggle between China and the United States. Which is to say, Europe will no longer adopt equidistant diplomacy between China and the United States: First, it believes that the transatlantic relationship has not always been reliable in years past, and that Europe has been subject to the United States and NATO in security matters;26 second, Europe will express and defend its independent positions and interests internationally, and is unwilling to blindly follow the United States and to be caught in a misguided struggle for world dominance in order to maintain the United States’ position of global hegemony.27 At the same time, despite growing calls in Europe to regard China as an institutional adversary, China sees the EU as a necessary global partner and an important force against the United States. Europe is now adopting a “third way” strategy between China and the United States in order to shape its role as a balancer in international affairs.28 Germany’s situation is even more complicated: With Europe as its diplomatic umbrella on one side, the United States as its most important values ally on the other, and China as its most important partner in terms of interests on the other, it is hard for Germany to go it alone in the difficult triangular relationship between China, the United States, and Europe. Germany has gained huge benefits from China in the Sino-U.S. trade dispute, and is more interested in continuing to realize its interests in China than in being a mere lapdog of the United States.29"
Analysis of Changes in Germany’s Perceptions of China,"Contemporary International Relations , Wang Shuo , Zhang Xiaoling","May 20, 2022","4. Some characteristics of the Germans themselves also play an important role at a deeper level. In general, the German mindset tends to be hidebound by convention and rigidly fixed, and this is one of the important factors behind why changes in Germany’s perceptions of China are out of sync with those other European countries. Germans have long been poked fun at by Latin communities in continental Europe, especially Italians, for being a people with no sense of beauty, mechanical, and “linear.” Firstly, this national character of conformity and inflexible thinking has made it difficult for Germans to change their ingrained prejudice against China, and made them unwilling to positively affirm and accept China’s rise. However, facing a rising power with increasing strength, the gap between objective reality and ingrained prejudices can cause Germany to lose its “sense of superiority” in front of China, triggering subjective “status anxiety.” In terms of policy and public opinion, this heightens the contradictions between China and the current world leaders,30 and in terms of perceptions of China, this is manifested in a view of China as an economic competitor and institutional adversary, and in an emotionally alienated relationship with China. Second, the Germans’ rigid and fixed mode of logic has left them momentarily at a loss and even disoriented when faced with the failure of their “change through trade” strategy toward China. Germany has long considered “change through trade” to be a panacea ensuring that German policy toward China maintains a balance between national interests and values. Chancellor Gerhard Schröder and Angela Merkel took this strategy to extremes. However, Germans argue that this strategy has only gained the special status they have enjoyed so far in the Chinese market, where there is huge market demand for high-quality products such as cars, machinery, and building components, but has failed to achieve the political change they want to see in China. On this point, Nils Schmid, foreign affairs spokesman for the SPD Bundestag caucus, said, “The convergence theory of ‘change through trade’ does not seem to be working at this point. I don’t want to declare it a failure, but China is narrowing the space for such an approach, at least at present. Although we will not stop our economic cooperation with China, at least Germany’s approach to China will have to be more clearly European-oriented in the future, and at the same time must move away from purely trade and economic topics in order to broaden Germany’s perception of China.”31 The failure of “change through trade” upset Germans. They were unable to accept, and even less willing to admit, the failure of what they assumed was a well-thought-out and prudent plan, and in order to find a reasonable explanation for the uncertainty in Sino-German relations and the damage to German interests that resulted from the failure of the plan, Germans prefer to reorient their perception of China from that of an economic partner to that of a competitor and institutional adversary, guided by the outdated, ingrained perception that “non-Western systems cannot achieve economic breakthroughs.” German hidebound thinking is even more reluctant to see the success of the Chinese model shatter the myth that “Western democracy is the only path to success,” and therefore prefers to move away from “inequality,” “injustice,” and “human rights.” Therefore, they prefer to look to issues such as “inequality,” “injustice,” and “human rights” to find suitable excuses for putting themselves justifiably on the opposite side of China, making their perception of China further divorced from reality."

Analysis of Changes in Germany’s Perceptions of China,"Contemporary International Relations , Wang Shuo , Zhang Xiaoling","May 20, 2022","In fact, Germany’s psychology toward China is extremely contradictory. On one hand, it fears that China will surpass it, guards against Chinese competition, and fears losing its sense of superiority in front of China; on the other hand, it recognizes China’s influence and importance, needs to rely on China, and hopes to cooperate with China in economic and global governance fields. But from this contradictory attitude one can find that the changes in Germany’s perception of China are not all negative, and within the repeated pulling between rationality and irrationality, cooperation and competition, there are some positive elements that should receive more attention, as they also provide possibilities for China and Germany to continue their practical, cooperative relationship."
Analysis of Changes in Germany’s Perceptions of China,"Contemporary International Relations , Wang Shuo , Zhang Xiaoling","May 20, 2022","1. From the past of looking down on, to a same-level view or even “looking up” to China. In Germany’s past, China was perceived as a developing country, but now Germany has to be on an “equal footing” with China, or even to “look up” to China. The EU-China: A strategic outlook report fully reflects an important change perceptions of China in the politics of Europe, including Germany, in which China is no longer defined as a developing country, but as a key global player and an advanced technological power.32 This change is also reflected in the German media and public’s perception of China. The German media has used the phrase “the sleeping lion has awakened” to describe this change.33 According to a study published by the Pew Research Center in mid-September 2020, 55 percent of German respondents considered China to be the world’s leading economic power, while only 17 percent consider the United States to be the world’s leading economic power. In addition, many German polls also show that the German public believes China is already a world economic power.34 The change in the German public’s perception of China from a developing country to a world economic power is reflected most directly in the changing perceptions of the “Made in China” image. As is well known, in the international community, “Made in China” had always been synonymous with low-cost products. However, public opinion surveys show that German consumers’ perceptions of Chinese products and brands have changed over the past five years. In a poll conducted by Huawei in 2016, more than half of respondents thought that Chinese products were of poor quality. Over the following years, however, various polls have reflected a significant increase in the use and appeal of Chinese goods in Germany, with many German consumers able to accurately identify Chinese brands like Huawei and Xiaomi by their brand names. According to the results of a 2017 survey by the German Association for Quality (DGQ), 70 percent of respondents had positive views of Chinese electronics. A poll conducted by Germany’s EBC Hochschule business school in 2019 showed that, even among German consumers who favor Apple products, only 8.6 percent of respondents had a negative attitude toward Chinese electronics. According to relevant data, German consumers’ perceptions of Chinese products and brands showed great improvement in 2020, and acceptance of Chinese products is increasing particularly among young Germans who have grown up with two Chinese brands, Huawei and TikTok. On one hand, “Made in China” still stands for low prices, and on the other, many Chinese brands have become leading international brands.35 The changing image of “Made in China” is a true portrayal of how the German public sees China as a world economic superpower. In addition, the German public feels strongly that China is playing an increasingly important role on the world stage as a global political power.36 China’s diplomatic progress has made the German public more aware that today’s China is not only a world economic superpower, but also a highly confident world political power.37 Although the image of China in the German media today is still predominantly negative, more and more of the German public believes that China is no longer a backward developing country, but a world economic and political superpower and that can compete with the United States."
Analysis of Changes in Germany’s Perceptions of China,"Contemporary International Relations , Wang Shuo , Zhang Xiaoling","May 20, 2022","2. Facing up to a Chinese development path that is different from that of the West. Germany is still increasingly finding China to be showing more institutional self-confidence on a global scale. Capacity for collective action. China’s crisis management achievements during the COVID-19 epidemic have left the German public in awe of the Chinese system’s advantages as shown in its capacity for collective action. Germans acknowledge that the fight against the epidemic reflected the advantages of the Chinese system, namely the enormous capacity for national mobilization and collective action demonstrated in the crisis, something the Germans were fundamentally incapable of achieving.38 Flexibility together with a planned approach. According to Jürgen Kracht, a German entrepreneur and China studies expert, there is a big difference between the Chinese and the Germans in terms of decision-making speed. Although Germany is still the leader in the international technology market, compared to the Chinese, the Germans take things too seriously and are too slow to develop products, so much so that the products the Germans bring to market are too mature. In contrast, the Chinese consider speed to be a very important source of international competitiveness, so they emphasize speed to market, for example by bringing less mature products to market first and then adjusting them according to customer requirements.39 Side-by-side with its flexibility in making specific decisions, the Chinese system is forward-looking and strategically visionary in a way that is simply unimaginable to Germans.40 The digital lifestyle. The German population living and working in China strongly feels the high degree of convenience, comfort, and well-being that high technology brings to the daily lives of Chinese nationals: The seamlessly connected rail transportation in China’s major cities and the ease of getting around provided by shared bicycles, as well as the full coverage of China’s domestic network brought by China’s advanced communication technology, have created digital modes of work and modern, digital currency-influenced lifestyles for the Chinese people to enjoy. Kracht says that Chinese nationals rely on smartphones and virtual digital currency payment methods to a degree that is unimaginable to Germans, and that such high-tech daily life is also unattainable in Germany. In this respect, Germany has clearly fallen behind. With regard to digital platforms and software use, German enterprises are too slow to react, too apprehensive, and too constrained by institutional aspects such as data protection.41 It is worth noting that the group of German citizens who feel the strengths of the Chinese system most strongly and directly are those who have experienced Chinese culture and institutions first-hand, mainly German businesspeople who have worked in China for years, foreign students studying in China, and expatriates in China. In contrast, the image of China in Germany’s domestic media is still predominantly negative, and those who have experienced the Chinese system first-hand always complain that the German media does not report the real China, that the China they see is very different from the China they see in the German media, and that the German media should report the positive aspects of China.42 Even though the German media has been consistently critical of China, more and more Germans have begun to look at the Chinese system more squarely."

More proactive approach to understanding and responding to China. Confronted with China’s development, Germany continues to realize that its own institutional dividend is gradually being lost, and it is adapting and reshaping its original strategy of engagement with China. Although, in terms of political institutions, China’s path is very different from the liberal democratic path that Germany and other Western countries brag about, the German public is beginning to shift its perspective and start thinking about the strengths of the Chinese system. However, Germany’s emphasis on building its “China competence” (Chinakompetenz) by learning from China is fundamentally aimed at better understanding China in order to be fully ready for the challenges coming from China. At the national level, the German federal government has implemented a Germany-wide project, with foreign and educational policy features, to build “China competence.” In October 2015, the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) launched the China Strategy 2015-2020 to develop German “China competence” in education and science, and to strengthen strategic cooperation between Germany and China in science and education.43 In May 2017, the BMBF, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs (KMK) conducted a comprehensive review of the current state of “China competence” in Germany, and jointly launched an initiative to support research on “knowing and understanding China.” At the end of 2019, Mercator joined other institutions to establish an educational network for the development of “China competence” in German primary and secondary school students. In June 2021, the BMBF released the Funding Guidelines for the Regional Development of ‘China Competence’ in Academia, with plans for a total of 24 million euros to be invested from 2017 to 2024 in support of developing independent “China competence” in German academia. The emphasis on “China competence” perfectly reflects the latent concerns in German politics and academia about China. Building “China competence” is an important part of Germany’s current China policy, and the German government has placed added emphasis on building “China competence” in the political sphere, treating “China competence” as a part of political education in Germany. It also emphasizes the importance of maintaining a sober attitude toward Sino-German relations while recognizing the differences in systems. Moreover, “China competence” building is to start in elementary school and go through all levels of university and vocational education, and related support programs (e.g., study tours to China).44 BMBF Minister Anja Karliczek believes it is essential to develop independent “China competence,” that is, the Chinese government should not interfere with the development of “China competence” in Germany. In the economic cooperation area, she emphasizes that German enterprises with business in China should try to recruit employees with “China competence” from Germany. By building “China competence,” Germany wants to build its own public discourse on China and limit China’s decision-making power and voice in German universities, research activities, and Sino-German economic cooperation.45"

Analysis of Changes in Germany’s Perceptions of China,"Contemporary International Relations , Wang Shuo , Zhang Xiaoling","May 20, 2022","Generally speaking, social perceptions drive the formation of the policy-making frameworks within which policy makers address specific issues and the public understands them. This helps to reduce complex realities to an understandable and workable level. The fact that Germany’s mainstream perceptions of China today are more disjointed than before is bound to have a significant impact on the shaping of its new framework for China policy. At the same time, although Germany’s leadership position has declined in relative terms since Merkel left the political scene, considering Germany’s own strength, German policy on China still influences the relationship between China and Europe to a large extent. Therefore, in the face of increasingly complex and diverse domestic perceptions of China, as well as the United States’ constant pressure on Germany and Europe, Germany needs to shed its spectator role in the great power competition and strengthen collective action within the EU by standing together with Europe and place its China policy within the overall EU China policy framework.46"
Analysis of Changes in Germany’s Perceptions of China,"Contemporary International Relations , Wang Shuo , Zhang Xiaoling","May 20, 2022","Although Germany’s perceptions of China are undergoing new changes, there are still some positive elements in them. Under the self-contained EU China policy framework, future German governments will not completely decouple from China and go against the basic principles of European pluralism, let alone erect walls on its own, and the doors of the German market will remain open to China.47 This year is the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Germany, and it should be taken as an opportunity to correctly understand the changes in Germany’s perceptions of China, in order to promote the healthy development of Sino-German and Sino-European relations. First, we should think deeply about the reality reflected by the changes in Germany’s perceptions of China. This is the inevitable result of cultural asymmetries and the clash of real interests. We should correctly grasp the new changes facing the two countries and avoid falling into misunderstandings, especially the trap of “clash of civilizations” theory. Second, we should calmly respond to future trends and developments in Germany’s perceptions of China, analyze the deep-seated reasons for such changes, and calmly deal with the possible impacts and challenges to the future development of Sino-German relations brought by the new perceptions. Third, we must attach importance to the changing pattern of Germany’s perceptions of China. The changes in Germany’s perceptions of China have a deep foundation in public opinion, which is often utilized by the political elite. We should fully understand this principle, get closer to the German reality, pay attention to the reasons for the formation of people’s perceptions of China, actively carry out activities for communication, understanding, and dialogue, and seek common ground while reserving our differences. Fourth, the development of Germany’s relations with other Western countries should be skillfully utilized to create a new space for great power diplomacy with Chinese characteristics. As mankind faces changes not seen in a century, Germany’s perceptions of China are changing at the same time that the Western allies, including the United States, are adjusting their perceptions of China. Although there is a general consensus on responding to the rise of China, the internal rifts among the Western allies will be difficult to heal, and it is important to create an international environment conducive to China as much as possible. Fifth, we should effectively utilize the strategic opportunity afforded by Germany’s “China competence” building. The starting point of Germany’s project to build “China competence” is to counter the so-called threat posed by the rise of China. Building Sino-German intercultural competence by supporting student and academic exchanges between China and Germany, and supporting Germans in learning Chinese, will help Germany to better understand China. However, since for most Germans, perceptions of China are indirect perceptions built on a foundation of insufficient information and misinformation, it is important to make effective use of this opportunity, and let more German people experience China’s development achievements, thereby achieving positive results from “proximity fostering change.”"
Analysis of the Biden Administration’s “Re-Ambiguation” of its Cross-Strait Policy,"Taiwan Studies , Xia Ang , Xie Yu","Jun 20, 2022","Since taking office, Biden himself and senior officials in his administration have emphasized on several occasions that the United States will adhere to the one-China policy and maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. The Biden administration’s Taiwan Strait policy is based on the three U.S.-China Joint Communiqués, the “Taiwan Relations Act,” and the “Six Assurances,” and is unlikely to break with the one-China principle. Most in the domestic academic community tend to believe that the Biden administration’s Taiwan Strait policy is beginning to return to a more rational and predictable approach compared to the Trump administration’s aggressive and adventuristic style. However, Biden has inherited Trump’s strategic thinking of “controlling China with Taiwan” and has played the “Taiwan card” with undiminished intensity, differing from Trump only in terms of means and methods. Although the Biden administration claims it is not breaking the one-China principle, its actions have constantly challenged the bottom line of the one-China principle, focusing on substantially elevating U.S.-Taiwan relations. For the Biden administration, “using Taiwan to control China” has become an important element of its Indo-Pacific strategy, and serves the United States’ grand strategy of containing China. This article considers the Biden administration’s Taiwan Strait policy as a tactical “re-ambiguation,” from which one can perceive how the Biden administration treats the “Taiwan card” and considers how to gain more benefits by playing it. This reflects the interest-oriented pragmatism in U.S. diplomacy. In order to analyze the Biden administration’s “re-ambiguation” of Taiwan Strait policy, it is necessary to understand the nature, manifestations and underlying causes of the “re-ambiguation.” We must also forecast the future trends of the Biden administration’s Taiwan Strait policy."

Analysis of the Biden Administration’s “Re-Ambiguation” of its Cross-Strait Policy,"Taiwan Studies , Xia Ang , Xie Yu","Jun 20, 2022","After more than a year since Biden took office, the outlines of the administration’s policy framework toward China can be traced by combing through relevant policy documents, official statements, and information from high-level meetings. These can be summarized along three dimensions: strategic competition, dialogue and cooperation, and managing differences."
Analysis of the Biden Administration’s “Re-Ambiguation” of its Cross-Strait Policy,"Taiwan Studies , Xia Ang , Xie Yu","Jun 20, 2022","First, there is the strategic competition dimension. The Interim National Security Guidance issued on March 3, 2021 shortly after Biden took office stated that “China is the only potential competitor capable of combining economic, diplomatic, military, and technological forces to pose a lasting challenge to a stable and open international system.” 1 On April 21, 2021, the U.S. Congress passed the Strategic Competition Act of 2021. The China-related section emphasizes the need to increase research investment and infrastructure development to meet the China challenge, while re-examining commitments to allies and partners and reestablishing U.S. leadership. It indicates that the United States will mobilize all strategic, economic, and diplomatic tools to counter China in an attempt to make the U.S.-China relationship develop in the direction of outright competition and full confrontation. 2 On February 11, 2022, the Biden administration’s Indo-Pacific Strategy of the United States noted that “The PRC is combining its economic, diplomatic, military, and technological might as it pursues a sphere of influence in the Indo-Pacific and seeks to become the world’s most influential power. China’s behavior is undermining freedom of navigation and other principles of international law, which undermines the stability and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific.”3 4 On March 28, 2022, the U.S. Department of Defense submitted a classified version of the 2022 National Defense Strategy to Congress, which for the first time examines the Nuclear Posture Review and Missile Defense Review in a comprehensive and integrated manner. It says that China is the most important “strategic competitor” of the United States, posing a threat to the United States in multiple areas, and that the key for U.S. defense is to prioritize the Chinese challenge in the Indo-Pacific region and strengthen deterrence against China. 5 On May 26, 2022, Secretary of State Blinken delivered a lengthy speech on China policy in which he stated that the United States has extremely limited ability to directly influence China’s strategic direction, and will therefore turn to building a “strategic environment” against China, and strongly advocated building a coalition to “contain China.”6 This shows that Biden has continued Trump’s positioning of China as a “strategic competitor” and his posture of strategic competition toward China."

Since Biden took office, there have been several high-level dialogues between the United States and China, showing that Biden does not want the strategic competition between the United States and China to evolve into a full-blown vicious competition, and is trying to avoid sliding into a “new Cold War” of full-fledged confrontation between the two countries. Biden has said that the two sides should improve their understanding of each other’s intentions through open and frank dialogue to ensure that the competition between the two countries is fair and healthy and does not evolve into conflict.7 Although Biden has also positioned China as a “strategic competitor” just as Trump did, he has singled out areas of common interest and is “prepared to work with China where it is consistent with U.S. interests.8 Because the United States cannot afford full-scale competition and “decoupling” from China, the United States needs China’s cooperation in areas such as dealing with COVID-19 and climate change. During video meetings between President Xi Jinping and Biden in November 2021 and March 2022, Biden emphasized that the United States does not seek to fight a “new Cold War” with China, change China’s institutions, or oppose China by strengthening alliances; the United States does not support “Taiwan independence,” nor does it intend to create any conflict with China. The U.S. side is willing to engage in frank dialogue with China and strengthen cooperation.9 One can see that the Biden administration’s policy toward China demonstrates a considerable degree of willingness for dialogue and cooperation."

In the March 18, 2022 meeting between the United States and China, both Biden and President Xi Jinping talked about their differences, which shows that both the United States and China have the willingness to manage their differences and intend to search for “guardrails” in the U.S.-China relationship. The purpose of managing differences is to have a stable U.S.-China relationship. This is in line with the interests of both countries, which have mutual strategic requirements, and it is the consensus of the two countries. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has caused a sudden change in the international situation, and impacted the overall geopolitical landscape and relationships between the major powers. At this time, both China and the United States both believe that the relationship is important, that they should face up to and manage their differences and rivalries, and that conflict need not break out. In his May 26, 2022 speech on China policy, Blinken repeatedly emphasized that the United States hopes to avoid conflict with China and to build a so-called “open and inclusive international system.”10 As is well known, the biggest difference between China and the United States is the Taiwan issue. Looking back over the history since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, whenever the one-China policy of the United States is implemented and the U.S. side fully respect China’s core interests and China’s territorial sovereignty and integrity on the Taiwan issue, Sino-U.S. relations can develop smoothly. But when the United States assails the one-China bottom line and framework of the Taiwan issue, and when the Taiwan issue is used by the United States to play the Taiwan card, to “use Taiwan to control China,” and to elevate Taiwan’s strategic pawn status, U.S.-China relations will be turbulent.11 Peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is in the interest of both countries, and China and the United States worked together to contain Chen Shui-bian’s “legal Taiwan independence” in the Taiwan Strait. Biden has told President Xi Jinping that the United States adheres to the one-China policy, and does not support “Taiwan independence.” It is willing to effectively manage competition and differences, has no intention of clashing with China, and promotes the stable development of relations between the two countries."

Analysis of the Biden Administration’s “Re-Ambiguation” of its Cross-Strait Policy,"Taiwan Studies , Xia Ang , Xie Yu","Jun 20, 2022","The United States’ Taiwan Strait policy is subordinate to its China policy and is governed by the general framework of U.S.-China relations. It is clear from the previous analysis that the Biden administration’s Taiwan Strait policy will definitely conform to the three dimensions of strategic competition, dialogue and cooperation, and managing differences within the overall framework of U.S.-China relations. First, the Biden administration will continue to play the “Taiwan card” and “use Taiwan to control China.” This conforms to the strategic competition dimension. The Biden administration will not go to extremes in playing the “Taiwan card” and will not engage in full-fledged conflict with China over Taiwan because the United States needs China’s cooperation in areas where the United States and China have common interests. This conforms to the dialogue and cooperation dimension. The Biden administration will only “re-ambiguate” its security commitments to Taiwan and will not explicitly give Taiwan any kind of security guarantees, at the same time also appropriately “browbeating” the DPP authorities for their “Taiwan independence” moves that provoke the mainland. In particular, at this sensitive time of conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the United States fears that it will be “dragged under” by Taiwan to the detriment of its interests. This conforms to the managing differences dimension. On April 15, 2022, a bipartisan group of six U.S. lawmakers visited Taipei and met with Tsai Ing-wen, saying that the United States’ so-called “support” for Taiwan included two key points, namely that “the United States does not seek conflict with China” and that “Taiwan cannot provoke.”12"
Analysis of the Biden Administration’s “Re-Ambiguation” of its Cross-Strait Policy,"Taiwan Studies , Xia Ang , Xie Yu","Jun 20, 2022","After clarifying the overall framework of U.S.-China relations, it is easy to understand that the Biden administration’s Taiwan Strait policy is a tactical “re-ambiguation.” That is, while adhering to the one-China policy, it keeps giving signals of “support” for Taiwan, attempting to disrupt the situation in the Taiwan Strait in order to maintain the United States’ strategic initiative there. From another perspective, this reflects the current strategic dilemma faced by the United States. First, at the global level: The United States’ declining relative national strength is no longer able to support an expansive global strategy, and the United States is unable to simultaneously invest enough resources in the key regions of Europe, the Middle East, and the Indo-Pacific to maintain its strategic advantage. Since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the United States has been putting its strategic focus on the European region in an all-out response to the biggest geopolitical crisis in Europe since the end of the Cold War. This objectively requires the United States to carry out “strategic contraction” in other regions. Second, at the level of U.S.-China relations: Now that the rise of China has become a fact, the United States needs to contain China, out of a hegemonic power’s defense against rising powers. Although Biden has stressed the need to engage in “the most intense strategic competition” with China, he has also recognized that China and the United States have many common interests, and that the United States needs China’s cooperation in these areas. Without China’s help, there will be many problems that the United States will be unable to solve, ultimately harming the interests of the United States. This shows that the Biden administration’s “re-ambiguation” of Taiwan Strait policy is in line with the current overall framework of U.S.-China relations and is a tactical rather than a strategic adjustment."
Analysis of the Biden Administration’s “Re-Ambiguation” of its Cross-Strait Policy,"Taiwan Studies , Xia Ang , Xie Yu","Jun 20, 2022","In short, the Biden administration’s “re-ambiguation” of Taiwan Strait policy is superficially a “fight without breaking” approach to playing the “Taiwan card,” but is essentially intended to contain China. In international relations, constructivism holds that “identity determines interests, and interests determine behavior.”13Given its identity as a world hegemonic power, the United States is destined to maintain hegemony as its core interest, and the means adopted to maintain that interest are influenced by power. The United States sees the rise of China as a challenge to U.S. hegemony, and playing the “Taiwan card” to contain China has become an important tool for the United States. At present, the power gap between China and the United States is narrowing further, and the United States is no longer able to gain an absolute power advantage in the Taiwan Strait. Therefore, the United States must pay attention to China’s position and concerns on the Taiwan issue when playing the “Taiwan card,” avoid irritating China, and avoid triggering a military conflict in the Taiwan Strait. This objectively requires that U.S. Taiwan Strait policy return to “strategic ambiguity,” which reflects a kind of American style of pragmatic diplomatic thinking."

Analysis of the Biden Administration’s “Re-Ambiguation” of its Cross-Strait Policy,"Taiwan Studies , Xia Ang , Xie Yu","Jun 20, 2022","The Taiwan issue is the most important and sensitive core issue in China-U.S. relations, and it is also a structural contradiction between China and the United States. The May 2021 cover article of The Economist, entitled “The Most Dangerous Place on Earth,” describes Taiwan as “the most dangerous place in the world,” saying that if the Taiwan issue is not handled properly, it may lead to the disastrous consequence of armed conflict between two nuclear powers, China and the United States.14On March 18, 2022, President Xi Jinping and Biden also pointed out during their video meeting that if the Taiwan issue is not handled properly, it will have a disruptive impact on the bilateral relationship. 15 Therefore, after carefully balancing risks and benefits, “re-ambiguation” has become the strategic choice of the Biden administration’s Taiwan Strait policy, mainly manifested in the release of “re-ambiguation” signals, hedging on written commitments, and obvious inconsistencies between statements and actions, as Biden attempts to “fight without breaking,” fully utilize Taiwan’s containment role, and maximize U.S. interests."

Analysis of the Biden Administration’s “Re-Ambiguation” of its Cross-Strait Policy,"Taiwan Studies , Xia Ang , Xie Yu","Jun 20, 2022","The United States has long pursued an ambiguous one-China policy, which ensures that the United States can achieve “dual deterrence” on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and maintain the so-called “status quo in the Taiwan Strait” while also avoiding the perception of “choosing sides,” thereby allowing the United States to achieve interest maximization in the Taiwan Strait. “Strategic ambiguity” is a typical low-cost, high-yield policy. Although U.S. Taiwan Strait policy tended to shift from “strategic ambiguity” to “strategic clarity” during the Trump era, Biden stopped this trend after taking office and “re-ambiguated” Taiwan Strait policy. While emphasizing his commitment to the one-China policy and to maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, Biden has repeatedly stressed that “the U.S. commitment to Taiwan is rock-solid.” This contradictory stance reflects a certain degree of strategic dilemma for the United States. That is, the United States wants to maintain its relationship with China, and it cannot let a full-scale conflict with China occur due to “using Taiwan to control China,” which would harm U.S. interests. Therefore, it must play the “Taiwan card” in a “fight without breaking” manner. In early May 2022, the U.S. State Department updated the “U.S.-Taiwan relations” statement on its official website, removing two important phrases: “The United States does not support ‘Taiwan independence'” and “Taiwan is part of China.” Some mainland scholars say this is a “regression” in the U.S. position on Taiwan and proof that the United States continues to “hollow out” the one-China policy.16 Biden has also repeatedly made “defend Taiwan” statements, telling the media twice in August and October 2021 that the United States would “defend Taiwan” if the mainland “attacked” it. 17 Most recently, on May 23, 2022, during a visit to Japan, Biden told the media that “if mainland China launches an attack, the United States would take military measures to protect Taiwan.” 18 Biden’s “defend Taiwan” statement momentarily had the outside world thinking that the U.S. Taiwan Strait policy was shifting to “strategic clarity,” but then the White House rushed to “put out fires,” saying that this was a “slip of the tongue,” and that the U.S. Taiwan Strait policy had not changed. On October 27, 2021, Tsai Ing-wen admitted in an interview with CNN that there were U.S. military personnel in Taiwan. Biden did not respond to this.19 Biden belongs to the traditional American establishment, which wants to maintain a state of “no unification, no independence, and no use of force” in the Taiwan Strait. 20 Only in this state can the U.S. gain the maximum benefit in the Taiwan Strait. Because of the sensitivity of the Taiwan issue, the United States will merely increase risks by giving “re-ambiguation” signals. As President Xi Jinping emphasized during his video meeting with Biden, it is very dangerous for some people in the United States to send wrong signals to the “Taiwan independence” forces.21"

Analysis of the Biden Administration’s “Re-Ambiguation” of its Cross-Strait Policy,"Taiwan Studies , Xia Ang , Xie Yu","Jun 20, 2022","The three U.S.-China Joint Communiqués are important historical documents guiding U.S.-China relations and the Taiwan issue, the core of which is the one-China principle. However, since coming to power, Biden has intentionally highlighted the importance of the “Taiwan Relations Act” and the so-called “six assurances” to the Taiwan authorities, elevating the “one act and six assurances” to the same level as the Three Communiqués or even higher. In a video meeting with President Xi Jinping on November 16, 2021, Biden emphasized the United States’ continued commitment to the one-China policy, guided by the “Taiwan Relations Act,” the three U.S.-China Joint Communiqués, and the six assurances. 22 The statement released by the White House places the “Taiwan Relations Act,” a domestic law of the United States, ahead of the three U.S.-China Joint Communiqués. On February 11, 2022, the Biden administration released its first Indo-Pacific Strategy Report, which made several references to Taiwan, but placed the three U.S.-China Joint Communiqués after the “Taiwan Relations Act” and the six assurances, despite emphasizing that the United States will adhere to the one-China policy. The State Department recently listed on its official website that the United States will “develop its relationship with Taiwan based on the longstanding one-China policy of the “Taiwan Relations Act,” the three U.S.-China Joint Communiqués, and the six assurances.” 23 One can see that the Biden administration has prioritized the “Taiwan Relations Act” for guiding the Taiwan issue, indicating that the U.S. commitment to Taiwan is higher than the U.S. commitment to the three U.S.-China Joint Communiqués.24 On one hand, this reflects the greater importance the United States attaches to domestic politics than to international politics, and on the other hand, it shows the Biden administration’s bias in favor of Taiwan. Biden is well aware of the sensitivity of the Taiwan issue in U.S.-China relations, and therefore intends to hedge the “Three Communiqués” with the “one act and six assurances.” This is an attempt to throw off the shackles of the one-China principle and provide room in which to play the “Taiwan card” in a “fighting without breaking” fashion."
Analysis of the Biden Administration’s “Re-Ambiguation” of its Cross-Strait Policy,"Taiwan Studies , Xia Ang , Xie Yu","Jun 20, 2022",(3) Statements and actions are clearly inconsistent
Analysis of the Biden Administration’s “Re-Ambiguation” of its Cross-Strait Policy,"Taiwan Studies , Xia Ang , Xie Yu","Jun 20, 2022","When the United States adheres to the one-China policy, there are safety “guardrails” to a certain extent on the competition and differences between China and the United States. But once the U.S. side does not adhere to the one-China policy, the “guardrail” edges will be breached, making it difficult to have a stable Sino-U.S. relationship. 25 Hence, while the Biden administration has many times verbally emphasized adherence to the one-China policy, such statements are more about symbolism. In terms of actions, Biden has been the same as Trump in pursuing a kind of hollowed-out one-China policy, that is, elevating the U.S.-Taiwan relationship. Since Biden came into office, statements on the Taiwan issue have generally led the outside world to believe that Biden is more rational and predictable than Trump, and the risk of conflict in the Taiwan Strait has fallen. However, Biden has positioned China as “the most serious competitor,”26 and in this context, Biden has played the “Taiwan card” to “use Taiwan to control China” with a forcefulness which has even surpassed Trump. On January 20, 2021, Taiwan’s “Representative to the United States,” Bi-khim Hsiao, was invited to Biden’s inauguration, breaking more than 40 years of practice in normalizing Sino-U.S. relations. Tsai Ing-wen claimed that “this fully demonstrated the improvement in Taiwan-U.S. relations.” In February 2021, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Asian and Pacific Affairs Sun Yong Kim met with Bi-khim Hsiao at the U.S. State Department, which also broke the “taboo” against Taiwanese officials entering the State Department, instead only operating outside the State Department.27 In June 2021, three U.S. Senators arrived in Taiwan aboard a U.S. Air Force C-17 transport plane to donate vaccines to the Taiwanese authorities on behalf of the U.S. government. In November 2021, four U.S. Senators and two U.S. Representatives again arrived on a U.S. Navy C-40A to meet with Tsai Ing-wen and entered Taiwan’s Department of Defense for the first time, strengthening U.S.-Taiwan military exchanges. In the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Biden has repeatedly sent delegations to Taiwan to demonstrate his so-called “support” for Taiwan. In addition, Biden approved three arms sales to Taiwan in August 2021, February 2022, and March 2022, worth $750 million, $100 million, and $250 million, respectively, for a total of more than $1 billion. On a fourth occasion in June 2022, Biden again approved $120 million in arms sales to Taiwan. This indicates that the Biden administration is stepping up the arming of Taiwan. The above actions by the Biden administration clearly violate its commitment to abide by the one-China principle, and they send the wrong signal to the Taiwan authorities. On March 15, 2022, Yang Jiechi, Director of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission General Office, met with U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in Rome, where Yang Jiechi emphasized that the U.S. side clearly has recognized that there is only one China in all three Sino-U.S. Joint Communiqués. The one-China principle was the prerequisite for the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, and it is the political foundation of China-U.S. relations. On the Taiwan issue, the current U.S. administration has made a commitment to uphold the one-China policy and to not support “Taiwan independence,” but its actions are clearly inconsistent with its statements. 28"

Analysis of the Biden Administration’s “Re-Ambiguation” of its Cross-Strait Policy,"Taiwan Studies , Xia Ang , Xie Yu","Jun 20, 2022","Against the background of the intensified strategic game between China and the United States, a consensus on the Taiwan issue has formed between the two U.S. political parties regarding “using Taiwan to control China,” but there are differences between the two parties in terms of how to implement “using Taiwan to control China” and thereby achieve U.S. interests. Under Trump, the United States took a simple and truculent approach to containing China, such as launching trade and technology wars against China and suddenly announcing the closure of Chinese consulates. On the Taiwan issue, Trump went from a phone call with Tsai Ing-wen right after he was elected, questioning the one-China principle, to announcing “the lifting of all restrictions on dealings with Taiwan” before he left office. On one hand, this stemmed from Trump’s character trait of personal recklessness; on the other hand, it reflects the Republican Party’s unilateralism and conservatism. However, this series of actions by the Trump administration had little effect and did not bring China to its knees, which prompted the United States to change its strategy and seek a more pragmatic policy toward China and the Taiwan Strait. Biden came to power as a Democratic president, and his foreign policy has distinctly Democratic undertones, namely its emphasis on values, ideology, and multilateralism. Biden has repeatedly expressed his intention to “deepen relations with ‘democratic Taiwan,'” and has clearly favored Taiwan in the chain of logic on high-level issues such as democratic values and “international rules.” 29 In addition, Biden is also facing pressure from the 2022 midterm elections, and playing the “Taiwan card” has always been an important means for both U.S. parties to boost their popularity during elections. On March 1, 2022, Biden sent a so-called “high-powered delegation” consisting of five former top military and national security officials to Taiwan to allay the uneasiness of the DPP authorities in the context of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on one hand, and more importantly, to show “support for Taiwan” to domestic voters in the United States. The nuance here is that former Trump administration Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a Republican, also visited Taiwan later, showing that the two U.S. parties are competing in the election to play the “Taiwan card” in order to reap political benefits."

Analysis of the Biden Administration’s “Re-Ambiguation” of its Cross-Strait Policy,"Taiwan Studies , Xia Ang , Xie Yu","Jun 20, 2022","From the Biden administration’s Indo-Pacific Strategy Report, one can see that the Taiwan Strait is the key direction of the administration’s Indo-Pacific strategy. The Biden administration’s “re-ambiguation” of Taiwan Strait policy provides a “helping hand” and an “implementation opportunity” for the United States to contain China in the Indo-Pacific region. In recent testimony before Congress, a senior Biden administration official described Taiwan as a “strategic asset” for the United States that is “critically important to defending U.S. interests in the Indo-Pacific.” Moreover, the U.S. Congress increasingly agrees with this view. 30 The sensitivity of the Taiwan issue dictates that the United States must calculate the risks and benefits cautiously when formulating its Taiwan Strait policy. As former U.S. Ambassador to China J. Stapleton Roy has said, there is a real risk of a nuclear war between the United States and China over the Taiwan issue, and the U.S. government should handle the Taiwan issue cautiously to prevent a slide into disorder and war. 31 When formulating Taiwan Strait policy, the United States wants to avoid conflict on one hand and maximize its benefits on the other, so “strategic ambiguity” has become the guiding principle of the Biden administration’s Taiwan Strait policy. Biden is well aware of the important role of the “Taiwan card” in containing China, and the “Taiwan card” is the least costly and most strategically beneficial “card” the United States has for containing China. Therefore, Biden must seize the “strategic opportunities” presented by the “Taiwan card,” and play the “Taiwan card” in various practical ways to contain China. The Taiwan Strait is a core interest of China, a matter of Chinese sovereignty and territorial integrity, and without a solution to the Taiwan issue, one cannot talk of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The Taiwan Strait does not constitute a core interest of the United States, and in the Taiwan Strait, the strategic pressure on the United States to “use Taiwan to control China” is much less than China’s strategic pressure. Relatively speaking, the United States is in a detached position in the Taiwan Strait, and by putting the “Taiwan card” to good use, the United States guarantees its strategic interests and strategic advantages. The United States can use the “Taiwan card” to restrain China’s development, deplete China’s strategic resources, and contain China’s rise."

Analysis of the Biden Administration’s “Re-Ambiguation” of its Cross-Strait Policy,"Taiwan Studies , Xia Ang , Xie Yu","Jun 20, 2022","Since the beginning of the 21st century, faced with the fact of China’s continuous rise, the United States has felt profoundly ill at ease, fearing that a rising China will challenge U.S. hegemony. In 2021, China’s economy will exceed 110 trillion yuan, 32 representing about 75% of the U.S. economy. This is the first time in history that any country’s economy has reached such a high proportion of the U.S. economy. The power gap between China and the United States is further narrowing. The power shift theory maintains that when a rising power reaches 80% of the dominant power, a “power parity” stage is entered in which a war for hegemony is most likely to occur, bringing a shift in power.33 China’s economy is moving steadily forward and is rapidly approaching the 80 percent mark, and this has heightened the anxiety of the U.S. strategic community, which has long held a realist view of power politics. How to handle relations with China, and what ways should be used to preserve the U.S. hegemonic position, have become a focus of discussion within the United States. A report released by the RAND Corporation on January 21, 2021—Implementing Restraint: Changes in U.S. Regional Security Policies to Operationalize a Realist Grand Strategy of Restraint— argues that China’s growing power and uncertain future intentions make it a major challenge to U.S. interests in the Asia-Pacific. The current U.S. domestic and foreign environment has changed. The United States is not strong enough to support a global expansion strategy and needs to engage in “strategic contraction,” and maintain U.S. hegemony using a less costly strategy of restraint from the perspectives of realism and pragmatism.34 The “re-ambiguation” of Taiwan Strait policy exactly meets the requirements of the U.S. restraint strategy, which emphasizes the role of Taiwan as a “pawn” on the condition of “maintaining the status quo” in the Taiwan Strait, so while the United States is helping Taiwan to improve its military capabilities, at the same time it is blurring its security commitments to Taiwan to avoid irritating China. The “re-ambiguation” of Taiwan Strait policy is a pragmatic way of “using Taiwan to control China” that helps ease the pressure on the United States to maintain hegemony."

Analysis of the Biden Administration’s “Re-Ambiguation” of its Cross-Strait Policy,"Taiwan Studies , Xia Ang , Xie Yu","Jun 20, 2022","Although the Biden administration has continued the Trump administration’s approach of strategic competition with China, at the same time Biden has not ruled out the possibility of China-U.S. cooperation. In fact, there are many areas in which China and the United States have common interests, such as dealing with COVID-19, climate change, terrorism, and nuclear proliferation. In the current U.S.-China climate, cooperation is just what the Biden administration urgently needs to promote. Addressing climate change was one of Biden’s priorities when he took office, and Biden has called climate change an “existential threat” to human civilization. He said during his campaign that he would “rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement on the administration’s first day,” and would “make large-scale, urgent investments domestically to put the United States on track to having a clean energy economy—achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.” According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), China and the United States together accounted for more than 40 percent of global carbon emissions in 2019. 35 For addressing climate change, China is a natural partner for the United States. The Chinese government has also proposed peak carbon and carbon neutrality targets. China is now a world leader in clean energy development, and is strong in green energy technologies such as solar panels. To reduce carbon emissions, the United States must quickly shift to clean energy sources such as solar power, and the cheapest place to get solar cells is China. If Biden really believes that climate change is an “existential threat” and that the United States “must lead the world,” he should turn his attention to China and seek China’s help. He should stop the slide toward a “new Cold War” with China, and instead accelerate the transition to a green energy economy focused on ensuring global compliance with the Paris Climate Agreement. 36 The two visits to China in April and September 2021 by Biden’s Special Envoy for Climate, John Kerry, are evidence of the Biden administration’s efforts to promote U.S.-China climate cooperation."
Analysis of the Biden Administration’s “Re-Ambiguation” of its Cross-Strait Policy,"Taiwan Studies , Xia Ang , Xie Yu","Jun 20, 2022",V.   Trends in the Biden administration’s Taiwan Strait policy
Analysis of the Biden Administration’s “Re-Ambiguation” of its Cross-Strait Policy,"Taiwan Studies , Xia Ang , Xie Yu","Jun 20, 2022","First, the Biden administration’s Taiwan Strait policy will continue to oscillate between “ambiguity” and “clarity. Biden’s previous “slip of the tongue” incident with regard to “defending Taiwan” reflects the subtlety of U.S. Taiwan Strait policy. It is foreseeable that the Biden administration’s Taiwan Strait policy will continue to be “ambiguous” and oscillate further between “ambiguity” and “clarity.” One cannot rule out that Biden will give similar signals on “defending Taiwan” in the future, to deliberately make the situation in the Taiwan Strait more confusing, and thereby maximize benefits for the United States. The Biden administration’s current team of senior officials has not achieved complete unanimity on China policy. Treasury Secretary Yellen, Commerce Secretary Raimondo, Trade Representative Tai, and Special Presidential Envoy for Climate Kerry can be regarded as the cooperation faction, advocating, from a pragmatic view of long-term interests, for a cooperative attitude in relations with China. Secretary of State Blinken, National Security Adviser Sullivan, and Coordinator for Indo-Pacific Affairs Campbell belong to the containment faction, which advocates a hardline containment policy toward China. From a long-term perspective, there are clear differences in the China policies of the two factions. In September 2021, U.S. Commerce Secretary Raimondo said “it makes no sense to talk about decoupling the United States and China,” and as a result was attacked in an article by Republican Senator Tom Cotton for “appeasement” of China and being “hooked on Chinese capital and cheap labor.” In February 2021, Biden was accused by American conservatives of “surrendering to China” when he expressed some goodwill toward China in an interview. So Biden’s “defending Taiwan ” statement in a sense comes from a balancing of internal political considerations."
Analysis of the Biden Administration’s “Re-Ambiguation” of its Cross-Strait Policy,"Taiwan Studies , Xia Ang , Xie Yu","Jun 20, 2022","Second, Biden will adhere to a pragmatic approach to the “Taiwan card.” The Trump administration saw Taiwan as a “bargaining chip” in the strategic game between China and the United States, an obvious deal, and Trump hoped that playing the “Taiwan card” would force China into making concessions in areas such as trade and exchange rates, allowing the United States to reap benefits. Trump has said that “everything is under negotiation, including one China,” and that “the United States will not necessarily pursue a one-China policy, unless China makes concessions on currency and trade issues.” 37 Trump’s questioning of the one-China principle shook the foundations of U.S.-China relations, sparking great concern. Biden is representative of the traditional U.S. political elite, and he understands the sensitivity and importance of the one-China principle in U.S.-China relations. The Biden administration has already shifted from “extreme competition” during the Trump years to seeking “guardrails” for U.S.-China relations, and Biden does not approve of Trump’s anti-establishment, transactional approach to the “Taiwan card.” But Biden also sees Taiwan as an important U.S. “strategic asset,” the value of which will be “extracted” as much as possible without crossing red lines. Therefore, Biden will adhere to a pragmatic approach to the “Taiwan card” and rationally calculate the costs and benefits."
Analysis of the Biden Administration’s “Re-Ambiguation” of its Cross-Strait Policy,"Taiwan Studies , Xia Ang , Xie Yu","Jun 20, 2022","Third, Biden will step up his efforts to “internationalize” the Taiwan issue. The Taiwan issue is ultimately a U.S. factor. The United States has now realized that, as China and the United States grow closer in strength, it is becoming clear that the United States does not have strength desired to face China alone in the Taiwan Strait. This, coupled with Biden’s foreign policy preference for multilateralism, has prompted the Biden administration to step up its efforts to “internationalize” the Taiwan issue. In March 2022, the Biden administration signed into law the “FY 2022 Omnibus Spending Act,” which stipulates that “any map produced, procured, or displayed at the expense of the United States Government shall not treat the island of Taiwan as a territory of mainland China, and shall not use the same color to designate the island of Taiwan and mainland China.”38 This is intended to deliberately separate the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, to create the illusion of “separation” between Taiwan and China among the American public and the international community, and to create an “internationalization” of the Taiwan issue. In addition, the Biden administration has spared no effort to support Taiwan’s expansion of its so-called “international space.” Besides trying to “stabilize” Taiwan’s “diplomatic relations,” the United States has mentioned Taiwan in several joint statements with the EU, Japan, South Korea, and the G7, expressing “concern for peace in the Taiwan Strait.” At the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on June 11, 2022, U.S. Secretary of Defense Austin emphasized that the United States will strengthen its relationships with allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific region, including its traditional alliances with Japan, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, and the Philippines, as well as its relationships with ASEAN members and members of the Quadripartite Security Dialogue.39 The implication is that the United States will bring these nations together to intervene in the Taiwan Strait. Blinken even issued a statement supporting Taiwan’s “active and meaningful participation in the United Nations system.” 40 This is an attempt to make the Taiwan issue more international and to manufacture obstacles to China’s reunification."

Biden’s foreign policy has a strong ideological and values-based overtones, dividing the world into the so-called “democracy” and “dictatorship” camps. Biden, who waves the “freedom and democracy” banner, believes that Taiwan is a like-minded “democratic partner” and always been viewed by the United States as a “beacon of democracy” in Asia, on the front lines of the fight against “autocracy and authoritarianism.” In the Biden administration’s “alliance of democracies” strategy, Taiwan can be compared to traditional U.S. allies Japan and South Korea. The DPP authorities also claim to be “a member of the democratic world,” attempting to use a so-called “values identity” to join the United States-led “democratic camp” and “rely on the United States to seek independence,” so as to oppose the mainland. In December 2021, the Biden administration organized a so-called “democracy summit” with the participation of 110 countries, to which the DPP authorities were also invited. Biden is openly “setting the stage” in the international arena for the “Taiwan independence” forces. Another reason for Biden to play the “liberal democracy card” in the Taiwan Strait is that, by strengthening ties with Taiwan in soft ways such as ideology and values, Taiwan’s “strategic value” can be brought fully into play without bumping up against the red line of the one-China principle. In the future, the Biden administration will certainly continue “making a fuss” over “freedom and democracy” to promote U.S.-Taiwan collusion and contain China."

On May 23, 2022, Biden said in Japan that the Russia-Ukraine conflict has made the responsibility of defending Taiwan “even more significant” and that mainland China “taking Taiwan by force” would “dislocate” the entire region, warning that the PLA military aircraft flying around Taiwan were “playing with fire.” This was one of the strongest public statements of U.S. support for Taiwan in the last decade.41 In his China policy speech, Blinken mentioned that the United States considers Russia’s military actions in Ukraine to be “the most serious and immediate threat to international stability,” but the United States still sees China as “a greater threat.” 42 At the recent Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, Secretary of Defense Austin said the Indo-Pacific region is a priority for the U.S. military, which has more than 300,000 troops stationed there, implying that the United States has not changed its strategic focus on account of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. 43"
Analysis of the Biden Administration’s “Re-Ambiguation” of its Cross-Strait Policy,"Taiwan Studies , Xia Ang , Xie Yu","Jun 20, 2022","U.S. strategic interests in the Taiwan Strait are far greater than those in Ukraine, and the United States has not neglected the Taiwan Strait because of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. First of all, the United States wants to avoid as much as possible responding simultaneously to two major geopolitical crises that could occur in Europe and the Taiwan Strait. Second, the United States also wants to focus on preventing China from taking similar actions in the Taiwan Strait, and has consequently increased its intervention in the Taiwan Strait. Since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Biden has sent one delegation after the other to Taiwan in a short period of time, and even U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wanted to visit Taiwan, but later failed to do so due to a positive COVID-19 test. Jacob Stokes, a researcher with the Indo-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, pointed out that his U.S. delegation was visiting Taiwan “to demonstrate our continued robust support for Taiwan” and that at a time of conflict between Russia and Ukraine, “the United States has not lost focus on the Indo-Pacific region, and China should not think or act like Russia.” 44 Stokes added that “maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is of the utmost importance to the United States and its regional allies and partners. And any use of coercion or force that seeks to upend the status quo would pose a major threat to U.S. interests and values.” 45 The clear increase in the frequency of U.S. warship and military aircraft activity around Taiwan recently could be interpreted as a kind of “warning” to China."
Analysis of the Biden Administration’s “Re-Ambiguation” of its Cross-Strait Policy,"Taiwan Studies , Xia Ang , Xie Yu","Jun 20, 2022",Conclusion
Analysis of the Biden Administration’s “Re-Ambiguation” of its Cross-Strait Policy,"Taiwan Studies , Xia Ang , Xie Yu","Jun 20, 2022","The current framework of U.S.-China relations dictates that the Biden administration will not abandon its strategic thinking of playing the “Taiwan card” and “using Taiwan to control China.” Since Biden took office, he has used nominal adherence to the one-China policy to undermine the one-China principle in order to achieve U.S. strategic interests, reflecting consideration of a pragmatism of sorts. The core goal of the Biden administration’s “re-ambiguation” of Taiwan Strait policy is to use the United States’ relatively superior geopolitical advantage in the Taiwan Strait to counterbalance China, in order to slow down China’s rise and maintain U.S. hegemony. Although the Russia-Ukraine conflict has made the United States more vigilant in the Taiwan Strait, and the United States has taken measures to increase its intervention there, such as sending delegations to Taiwan and warships across the Taiwan Strait, the United States still has not breached the bounds of “strategic ambiguity” in general. The U.S. Taiwan Strait policy has not changed from “strategic ambiguity” to “strategic clarity,” but has only seen a tactical “re-ambiguation.” While the Biden administration’s “re-ambiguation” of Taiwan Strait policy appears to be “shrewd,” in fact it seriously undermines China’s security interests and sovereignty claims, leaving hidden dangers for future conflicts in the Taiwan Strait. As the United States and China grows closer in strength, Taiwan will gradually change from a strategic “asset” to a “liability” for the United States. 46 At present, the mainland has firmly grasped leadership and the initiative in cross-strait relations, and the U.S. policy of Taiwan Strait “re-ambiguation” is becoming increasingly ineffective."
Areas Where Key Breakthroughs Are Needed to Cross Over the Middle-income Stage,China Reform Net,"Mar 30, 2022","The middle-income stage is an objectively existing stage that is necessary for a country’s economic and social development. In 1998, the World Bank’s per capita GDP for lower-middle-income countries was $761-3030 USD while China’s per capita GNI was $800 USD that year. After 12 years of rapid growth since entering the ranks of lower-middle-income countries in 1998, China entered the ranks of upper-middle-income countries in 2010. Since then, after more than 10 years of rapid growth, our current per capita GNI has already exceeded $10,000 USD. According to the World Bank’s standard, China is currently in the middle-income stage and close to the high-income range."
Areas Where Key Breakthroughs Are Needed to Cross Over the Middle-income Stage,China Reform Net,"Mar 30, 2022","For the present, to cross over the middle-income stage, we need key breakthroughs in the following areas."
Areas Where Key Breakthroughs Are Needed to Cross Over the Middle-income Stage,China Reform Net,"Mar 30, 2022","First, we must build an international environment conducive to crossing over the middle-income stage. No matter how the global structure changes, we must adhere to reform and opening up. We must vigorously promote the construction of a “community with a shared future,” carefully handle the relationship between international common interests [共存利益] and national self-interests [自存利益], seek the greatest points of cooperation, seek international common interests, create new cooperation platforms, and seek mutually beneficial solutions. At the same time, we must actively promote the globalization process and expand China’s trade circle. Practice has proven that the global free trade environment is beneficial to China. China must expand its trade circle, with free trade as the standard, and accelerate the negotiation of multilateral and bilateral free trade agreements. In addition, we must coordinate the relationships between various values from around the world and China’s core values. The world is diverse, allowing the existence of various values and systems, so we must implement a harmonious diplomatic route."
Areas Where Key Breakthroughs Are Needed to Cross Over the Middle-income Stage,China Reform Net,"Mar 30, 2022","Second, we must speed up the cultivation and expansion of the middle-income population and create conditions for the formation of a new olive-shaped society dominated by the middle-income population. The middle-income population is the main entity for innovation, the main entity for consumption, the main entity for human capital improvement, and the main entity for social stability. The expansion of this population will help us cross over the middle-income stage. Cultivating and expanding the middle-income population is a systems project. Under the premise of continuously increasing the proportion of labor income in the distribution of national income and with the goal of “raising the lower class, expanding the middle class, and regulating the upper class,” we must accelerate the reform of the fiscal and taxation system, financial system, household registration and social security system, and national income distribution system, remove institutional and policy obstacles, and create a tolerant institutional environment for the growth of the middle-income population. First, we must work to reduce the size of the low-income population, enhance the development skills of low-income people, and generally improve their level of social security. Second, it is necessary to reduce taxes and burdens for the middle-income population, continue to raise the threshold of personal income taxes, lower the personal income tax rate, and reduce the number of tax brackets. At the same time, pre-tax deductions and subsidies for the purchase of energy-saving home appliances should be provided upon the first home purchase by low- and middle-income populations."
Areas Where Key Breakthroughs Are Needed to Cross Over the Middle-income Stage,China Reform Net,"Mar 30, 2022","Third, we must speed up urbanization and create the conditions for promoting the upgrade of the industrial structure and expanding social consumption. In the future, we must use more public resources for urbanization, promote the transfer of the agricultural population to cities and build an urbanized society (市民化社会). Urbanization provides a golden opportunity (黄金结合点, lit. golden convergence point) to increase the new kinetic energy for both sides of supply and demand. To actively promote new urbanization, we must adjust the urbanization strategy and accelerate related institutional reforms. First, we recommended implementing the strategy of building “clusters” at the upper level and expanding the “base” at the lower level. To build a “cluster” at the upper level means building several large urban agglomerations in the national regional layout in order to enhance and drive urbanization through “clusters.” The expansion of the “base” at the lower level means building administrative villages with populations of more than 2,000 people into small towns according to urban standards while also increasing the population-carrying capacity of existing small towns. Second, with the exception of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other megacities, the standards and conditions for farmers to enter and settle in cities should be relaxed within a limited time. In addition, we must establish a public cost-sharing mechanism conducive to promoting the urbanization of the agricultural transfer population and minimizing the settlement costs for this population."
Areas Where Key Breakthroughs Are Needed to Cross Over the Middle-income Stage,China Reform Net,"Mar 30, 2022","Fourth, we must accelerate the cultivation of new drivers of economic growth and create the conditions for realizing the transition from old to new drivers of economic growth. In the future, the main task will be to promote the transformation of traditional industries and support the development of emerging industries while eliminating outdated production capacity. The main idea of the transformation of traditional industries is to firmly grasp the new opportunities presented by the new global round of industrial technology revolution and make full use of new technologies, new processes, new formats, and new models to transform traditional industries and take the intelligent, green, and high-end road. In supporting the development of emerging industries, we must give priority to supporting the development of a number of new industries, cultivating a number of leading enterprises with international competitiveness, focus on innovation to make breakthroughs in a number of advanced technologies, key core technologies, and common basic technical difficulties that are “chokepoints,” cultivate and introduce a group of leading talents and a group of high-end skilled talents, and introduce a number of major reform-and-opening-up measures, promulgate a series of new policies that can quickly improve the business environment, such as reducing approvals, reducing license issuance, reducing monopolies, and continuing to reduce taxes and fees."
Areas Where Key Breakthroughs Are Needed to Cross Over the Middle-income Stage,China Reform Net,"Mar 30, 2022","Fifth, we must strengthen science and technology (S&T) innovation and improve China’s independent innovation capabilities. We must further increase the intensity of R&D investment, and especially the investment intensity of enterprises. We must strengthen the research and development of key, core, and basic technologies, focus on industrial transformation and upgrades, urgently form a number of major technical projects, and carry out technological research. We must improve guidance mechanisms, innovation incentive mechanisms, and innovation policies. While strengthening national centralized innovation, we must support private innovation and encourage public scientific research institutions, universities, and enterprises to carry out innovation partnerships. We must improve the S&T innovation service system, support the development of S&T service institutions, such as those for R&D design, intellectual property protection, S&T achievement testing, and intermediary consulting, and create a number of public S&T service platforms in order to serve the innovation of small and medium-sized enterprises."

We must further relax market interventions, let the market play a decisive role in resource allocation, and give enterprises greater autonomy in market operations. We must promote the transition of the function of the government from management to governance and improve social governance."

Building a Generational Mechanism for Policy Coordination,"Chinese Academy of Fiscal Sciences , Liu Shangxi","Mar 30, 2022","China has entered a new stage of development with diverse goals and policies. In the past, we pursued high-speed growth, but now we pursue high-quality development. From the perspective of development economics, it is the pursuit of development from the pure pursuit of growth. Growth is just the quantitative concept of getting bigger. Moreover, development is not only a matter of scale and quantity but also a matter of quality and structure. It is not only an economic issue but also a social, ecological, and environmental protection issue. The overall characteristics of China in the new stage of development are becoming more and more obvious. At present, only the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) is not enough. All aspects of the economy and society are interrelated and restrict one another so they must all be considered. Therefore, the overall characteristics of development are derived from multiple goals and multiple policies. The pursuit of high-quality development is not a certain aspect, a certain field, or a certain region but rather an overall, all-round, long-term high-quality development. The theme of high-quality development in the new era also provides legitimacy for governments at all levels and departments to issue campaign-style policies. As a result, the protracted war has turned into an assault."
Building a Generational Mechanism for Policy Coordination,"Chinese Academy of Fiscal Sciences , Liu Shangxi","Mar 30, 2022","From the previous stage of focusing on growth goals to a multi-target stage such as growth goals, people’s livelihood goals, and security goals and when putting forward these goals, there is no clear order or priority to hierarchical classifications. As practical departments tend to advance hand in hand, policies are becoming more and more diversified. The economic impact of policies grows, not only from the economic policies and market supervision policies formulated and implemented by the economic authorities but also from the non-economic policies and social supervision policies issued by the education authorities, S&T authorities, health and wellness authorities, environmental authorities, publicity authorities, and network and information authorities."
Building a Generational Mechanism for Policy Coordination,"Chinese Academy of Fiscal Sciences , Liu Shangxi","Mar 30, 2022","In this process, the contradiction between the new stage of pluralistic goals and pluralistic policies and the imperfect institutional foundation of pluralistic policies has become prominent, which is reflected in the “Three Transformations that Do Not Align.”"
Building a Generational Mechanism for Policy Coordination,"Chinese Academy of Fiscal Sciences , Liu Shangxi","Mar 30, 2022","First, social transformation does not match economic transformation. The reform and opening up over the past 40 years has mainly changed the planned economy but in the past it was not just the planned economy but a “planned society” based on the planned economy. So far, the planned social system has not undergone real major reforms, and many of the problems currently encountered are a result of the planned social system, not the problems of the planned economy. Factors in the planned economy still exist, such as the market-based allocation of factors, but the bigger constraint is the planned social system, which has seriously hindered the deepening of market reform. This is the result of social transformation failing to keep up with economic transformation. The new development stage pursues many goals, such as higher efficiency and fairer and more beautiful development. Whether it can be successfully realized depends on social transformation, but social transformation has not kept up with the pace of development."
Building a Generational Mechanism for Policy Coordination,"Chinese Academy of Fiscal Sciences , Liu Shangxi","Mar 30, 2022","Second, economic transformation does not match green transformation. From the perspective of social transformation and economic transformation, economic transformation is at the forefront, and social transformation lags behind. Moreover, from the perspective of economic transformation and green transformation, green transformation rushes ahead, and economic transformation lags behind. How to avoid the moving approach in green transition is a governance-level issue to be resolved. The moving approach has recurred in different ways and in different sectors, and it remains a question whether it can be truly avoided in the future."
Building a Generational Mechanism for Policy Coordination,"Chinese Academy of Fiscal Sciences , Liu Shangxi","Mar 30, 2022","Third, there is a mismatch between government transformation and development transformation. Over the years, the emphasis has been on accelerating the transformation of government functions, but what changes have been made in government functions? How have they transformed? Government functions include economic functions and social functions. From the perspective of national governance, government transformation is the transformation of national governance. This is precisely the goal of comprehensively deepening the reform determined by the Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Several Major Issues Concerning Comprehensively Deepening the Reform issued by the Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Government transformation must further keep up with the overall requirements of development and transformation."
Building a Generational Mechanism for Policy Coordination,"Chinese Academy of Fiscal Sciences , Liu Shangxi","Mar 30, 2022","The mismatch of these three transformations has led to the lack of a foundation for the current multi-goal and multi-policy system. The overall framework for deepening the reform has been set up, but from the perspective of the whole of society, there are actually many problems. For example, the planned social system based on the planned economy of the past still requires breakthrough reforms. The basic framework of the institutional system left over from the planned social system has not changed. Many of the micro-foundations of education, science, culture, and health are public institutions, involving tens of millions of people, and it is a knowledge-intensive group. It is still difficult to unleash the creativity of personnel in the institutional system. This is the root cause of many livelihood issues such as education, medical care, and employment that are difficult to solve through policies alone."
Building a Generational Mechanism for Policy Coordination,"Chinese Academy of Fiscal Sciences , Liu Shangxi","Mar 30, 2022","2. Avoid the “fallacy of composition,” “fallacy of decomposition,” and engineering thinking tendencies of policies"
Building a Generational Mechanism for Policy Coordination,"Chinese Academy of Fiscal Sciences , Liu Shangxi","Mar 30, 2022","Under the current multiple goals, the rigid assessment of policies can easily lead to the pursuit of extremes, short-termization, and indexation. Excessive pursuit of indicators is somewhat similar to the planned indicators of the past. There are many goals and many policies, and each indicator must be assessed. If one is not managed well, it will be rejected. Excessive indexing in policy also leads to a lack of necessary policy innovation space to account for local conditions. Under the circumstance of multiple and rigid policies, local governments have limited financial resources and cannot adjust financing uses, such that the space for autonomy is gradually narrowing. It is difficult for local governments to give full play to their initiative, enthusiasm, and creativity. Under a strict accountability mechanism, local governments must have a basis for everything they do, and they must wait for documents, instructions, or notices, otherwise they may be judged as “flexible,” “discounted,” or “disorderly behavior.” This issue continues to grow. The risk of post liability will involuntarily lead to the overall contraction of the creative behavior of local governments. Extreme and mechanical behaviors have instead increased, a departure from the vitality of the past."
Building a Generational Mechanism for Policy Coordination,"Chinese Academy of Fiscal Sciences , Liu Shangxi","Mar 30, 2022","In this case, the way the policy is implemented brings forth the “fallacy of composition” and the “fallacy of decomposition.” The “fallacy of composition” is that the policies are correct from the perspective of various authorities, and they all have certain goals, but when viewed together, if they advance in unison, it will be impossible to achieve the “thousands of threads and governments at the community level as a single needle that weaves.” The “fallacy of decomposition” is that systematic tasks that should not be decomposed are decomposed. Some are broken down across various authorities and various places, and some are broken down over various time periods. For example, on the issue of pollution reduction and carbon reduction, if the assessment is conducted every five years, there will be some flexibility for local governments. If there is time to make necessary preparations, enterprises will have clear expectations and know how to change and adjust. If the assessment is conducted every six months, the local government has to take tough administrative measures, which will lead to the stagnation of development, thus the “fallacy of decomposition.” Excessive and overly detailed task decomposition arises from the idea that better clarification of responsibilities and greater pressure can serve as a motivation. In fact, pressure does not serve as motivation but rather results in overall disorder."
Building a Generational Mechanism for Policy Coordination,"Chinese Academy of Fiscal Sciences , Liu Shangxi","Mar 30, 2022","At a deeper level, this is directly related to the engineering mindset. Solving social problems with engineering thinking can lead to widespread chaos. The task of building a house can be very finely divided, even by several companies working at the same time because precise calculations can be made, and there are very precise standards for construction locations and required materials such as for rebar and cement. However, if a solution for social goals, social policies, and social problems is implemented as a project and the indicators are decomposed, the finer the points are, the greater the degree of uncertainty. To depart from engineering thinking, do not assume that greater design detail at the high level is better or that more indicators would be better to avoid the alienation of the grassroots. Since there are many uncertainties in economic and social issues and information asymmetry, it is difficult to fully foresee possible changes over time, so in this case, it is necessary to reserve room for ambiguity. Social coupling is not a precise coupling in the sense of physics but rather a kind of ambiguous coupling, so it is necessary to allow for the existence of ambiguity, otherwise it will be counterproductive."
Building a Generational Mechanism for Policy Coordination,"Chinese Academy of Fiscal Sciences , Liu Shangxi","Mar 30, 2022","Therefore, under the condition of an uncertain macro environment, it is necessary to leave more room and flexibility for policymaking, and the direction of policy assessment should serve as a guide rather than an excessive pursuit of indicators."
Building a Generational Mechanism for Policy Coordination,"Chinese Academy of Fiscal Sciences , Liu Shangxi","Mar 30, 2022",3. Build a mechanism for generating policy coordination
Building a Generational Mechanism for Policy Coordination,"Chinese Academy of Fiscal Sciences , Liu Shangxi","Mar 30, 2022","Policy synergy across divisions of power: Documents of the Party Central Committee have always called for giving local governments greater autonomy and governance, but now the tendency towards “meticulous” policies has weakened local autonomy. Every move hinges on a one-vote veto such that any single authority can have the power of life and death over local governments. Some have ridiculed this as “a thousand knives slicing down upon a single head” rather than the “thousands of threads and governments at the community level as a single needle that weaves.” From the perspective of national governance, the local government should be regarded as the main body of first-level governance and given independent decision-making power in governance. In terms of major national strategies and major policies, local governments should creatively transform and implement them according to actual local conditions, rather than mechanically and dogmatically copying central policies."
Building a Generational Mechanism for Policy Coordination,"Chinese Academy of Fiscal Sciences , Liu Shangxi","Mar 30, 2022","Policy synergy along lines of authority: Synergy along lines of authority is first and foremost the policy synergy between the economic sector and the non-economic sector. It stands to reason that China has more political advantages and institutional conditions for coordination across departments, but from the results, the level of coordination is poor. If there is a sense of the overall situation, coordination along lines of authority should be a breeze. There is also a particularly important relationship between lines of authority, that is, the relationship between matters and money. Due to the lack of an effective coordination mechanism, in fact, many policies issued by non-financial authorities require local governments to increase spending, which is adding a lot of potential spending to future finances. If a locality is financially constrained and its policy enforcement is compromised, the locality will be held accountable. As a result, the local government can only find ways to raise funds or even utilize illegal financing and borrowing, resulting in hidden debts. In order to achieve the goal of preventing and controlling financial risks and assuming the main responsibility of the local government, the local government will integrate finances, link local state-owned enterprise platform institutions with finances, and make overall use of financial resources. However, in this way, there will be no division between local governments and enterprises, and there will be no division of labor between the government and the market, which will lead to greater risks."
Building a Generational Mechanism for Policy Coordination,"Chinese Academy of Fiscal Sciences , Liu Shangxi","Mar 30, 2022","Therefore, policies issued by various authorities should be evaluated in advance, and the accounts of future fiscal expenditures should be calculated, which should be matched with the future fiscal capacity. This game of chess should be formed into the overall consideration of future budgets. If many policies are introduced without considering the conditions of future budget constraints, policies will fail or local finances will be skewed and financial pressure will increase. This is a major risk that must be considered for high-quality development. When policies are introduced, take less for granted, expect more uncertainty, and do more risk assessments on policies to avoid many things that should not happen."

For the latter two, China can basically achieve self-sufficiency and the level of autonomy over market development and government supervision is relatively high. In contrast, Chinese dependence on external oil and gas exceeds 72% and 44% respectively, and it is necessary to take both the international and domestic markets into account. A “high external and low internal” price inversion will swallow up the profits of the import link and produce a situation wherein supply is tight. On the other hand, a “low external and high internal” price situation would lead to a large volume of imports, which would dampen the enthusiasm of China’s upstream oil and gas industry and would not be good for the healthy development of the domestic oil and gas industry."

The regional markets will be unified with each other, but there is no clear requirement for a single market operating entity. In view of the current domestic situation, it is very much necessary to standardize the construction of oil and gas trading centers and establish a unified national oil and gas futures and spot market system. Resolutely putting an end to the “popping up everywhere” style of construction of local oil and gas trading centers will help to reduce homogeneous and vicious competition, break down local barriers, improve allocation efficiency for the cross-regional flow of resources, and form international price influence as quickly as possible."

At the same time, China is in a critical period of building a new type of electricity system. The increase in the penetration rate of clean energy has posed higher requirements for the comprehensive regulation capabilities of the electricity system and posed a challenge to the secure and stable operation of the electricity system. There is a need to further improve the composition of the electricity market system, unify the types and standards for the inclusion of diversified market entities, realize the integrated operation of sources, networks, loads, and storage using marketized means, fully incentivize the enthusiasm of market players to participate, release flexible regulation capabilities, and promote the linkage of balanced electricity system supply and demand and electricity market operational order.

We must adhere to strengthening political building as the guide, deeply understand the decisive significance of the “Two Affirmations,” resolutely live up to the “Two Upholds,” forever maintain a political character of loyalty, cleanliness, and responsibility, and help “China’s governance” to create new miracles.
The most fundamental guide to political building work: Arm the mind with Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, strengthen the political consciousness of casting the soul and strengthening the body
Political resolve stems from theoretical clarity. Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is the latest achievement of the Sinification and modernization of Marxism, the essence for our times of Chinese culture and Chinese spirit, the ideological banner that guides the Chinese nation to grow strong, and the guide to action for the people of the nation to march towards the second centenary goal. We must treat studying deeply, understanding thoroughly, and putting into action Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as our own political requirements, work needs, and spiritual pursuits. We must strengthen the endogenous driving force for the study of the Party’s innovative theory and constantly seek practical results in the combination of “learning, understanding, research, and application.” We must take the lead in being firm believers, active disseminators, and faithful practitioners of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.
Be committed to the pairing of study with understanding to promote comprehension. Be committed to reading more of the original works, diligently studying original texts, and deeply understanding the principles, earnestly studying the significance, scientific system, essence, and practical requirements of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and deeply comprehending its original contribution to the Sinification and modernization of Marxism. Deeply understand the truth that when it comes to “why the Chinese Communist Party can, and why socialism with Chinese characteristics is good, ultimately, it is because Marxism is great.” Instill this in your mind and take this truth to heart.
Be committed to the pairing of study with research to promote deepening. Accurately grasp the Marxist epistemology contained in Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and continuously deepen understanding and research on the laws of the Communist Party’s governance, the laws of socialist construction, and the laws of the development of human society. Consciously use Marxist standpoints, viewpoints, and methods, deepen research on “the great matters of the nation” (国之大者), deepen research on major theoretical and practical issues in the field of politics and law, and better grasp the laws of politics and law work in the new era.
Be committed to the pairing of study with application to promote transformations. Promote the learning style of linking theory with practice and strive to transform achievements in studying and implementing Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era into political consciousness regarding strengthening the “Four Consciousnesses,” firming up the “Four Matters of Confidence,” and achieving the “Two Upholds.” Transform such achievements into innovative ideas for promoting the high-quality development of politics and law work. Transform such achievements into effective measures for promoting self-revolution on the politics and law front; and transform them into a strong capacity for preventing risks, ensuring security, and protecting stability, striving to build a higher level of security for China.
The most important requirements of political building: Resolutely achieving the “Two Upholds” and resolutely obeying the command of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core
The politics and law front must treat achieving the “Two Upholds” as the top priority of strengthening political building, implement this throughout all aspects and the whole process of performing duties and responsibilities, and resolutely safeguard General Secretary Xi Jinping’s status as the core of the Party Central Committee and the core of the whole party.
In terms of sentiment, wholeheartedly embrace the core. The Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core has led the whole Party and the people of the whole nation to usher in a new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, opening up a new realm of Sinification and modernization of Marxism, creating a new great cause to achieve the first centenary goal, and launching a new journey in the march towards the second centenary goal. The Chinese nation has ushered in a great leap, from standing up and becoming rich, to becoming strong. General Secretary Xi Jinping’s great prestige, leadership style, outstanding wisdom, charisma, and feelings for the people have become a huge spiritual force that inspires and motivates us. We sincerely feel that the fact that General Secretary Xi Jinping has become the popularly supported and well-deserved core of the Party, people’s leader, and commander-in-chief of the army is the great fortune of the Party, the country, and the people. We must always be loyally devoted to protecting the core and embracing the core.
Mentally, always keep close to the core. In the face of great changes unseen in a century, the closer we get to our goal, the more complex the situation and the more arduous the task, the more we need General Secretary Xi Jinping to be at the helm to navigate and the more we need the steadying role of the CCP Central Committee’s centralized and unified leadership. The politics and law front must unremittingly arm our minds with Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and make timely efforts to follow, study and implement General Secretary Xi Jinping’s new ideas, new thoughts, and new strategies, and fully understand what General Secretary Xi Jinping is concerned with and is emphasizing. We must consolidate the ideological foundation of aligning with the core and listening to the command of the Party Central Committee, ensuring that new-era politics and law work always moves ahead in the right direction as pointed out by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
Politically, remain absolutely loyal to the core. Building political loyalty is the primary task of building an invincible political and legal army. Achieving the “Two Upholds” is the most fundamental requirement of political loyalty. The politics and law front must treat achieving the “Two Upholds” as the basic political norm to abide by, as the fundamental political requirement to implement, and as the greatest political discipline and political rule to enforce. We must always maintain a high degree of consistency with the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core in terms of political position, political direction, political principles, and political path.
In action, resolutely defend the core. Being committed to achieving the “Two Upholds” means it is imperative to put them into action. The politics and law front must thoroughly implement the important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping and the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee. We must resolutely obey the orders of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core, ensuring that we resolutely respond to what the Party Central Committee advocates, resolutely comply with what the Party Central Committee decides, and resolutely put a stop to what the Party Central Committee prohibits. We must resolutely oppose words and actions that undermine the Party’s centralized, unified leadership, resolutely struggle against phenomena that affect the unity of the Party, and resolutely eradicate risks and hidden troubles that affect national political security.
The most urgent issue of political building work: thoroughly eliminate the toxic effects of Sun Lijun’s political gang and effectively optimize the political ecology of politics and law organs
The earnest investigation and punishment of Sun Lijun’s political gang fully demonstrates the firm determination of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core to comprehensively and strictly govern the Party. The politics and law front must be certain to completely eliminate the toxic influence of Sun Lijun’s political gang, use cases to warn, use cases to promote reform, and use cases to promote governance so as thoroughly “detoxify” and purify the political ecology of politics and law organs.
Recognize the critical nature of “detoxification.” Sun Lijun’s political gang is a typical example of disloyalty and dishonesty to the Party and the “Seven Presences [of Political Misbehaviours]” (“七个有之”).  It is a typical example of the intertwining of political and economic problems and extreme corruption and degeneracy. It is a typical example of aggressively engaging in privileges, acting recklessly, and flagrantly violating discipline and law as enforcement is being tightened. Completely eradicating the toxic influence of Sun Lijun’s political gang is an inevitable requirement for ensuring that the “knife handle” is firmly in the hands of the Party and the people and is the top priority of politics and law organs for creating a clean and upright political ecology. We must deepen our understanding politically, and we must take the complete eradication of the poisonous influence as an urgent and serious political task.
Face square on the complexity of “detoxification.” Since the launch of efforts to earnestly eradicate the poison, relevant localities and units have attached great importance to it and achieved good results, but the task of “detoxification” is still formidable and complicated. Sun Lijun’s political gang is a cancer that seriously endangers the health of the Party’s whole. The poison has affected politics and law workers in certain localities and departments. We must keep a clear head and face square on the seriousness of the “toxic disease” and the breadth of “toxicity,” and resolutely avoid negative phenomena such as passing over issues prematurely, “turning a blind eye,” or responding unevenly.
Be committed to the thoroughness of “detoxification.” To eradicate the poisonous influence of Sun Lijun’s political gang, we must never just go where the wind takes us and must never act superficially; we must take swift, concrete, and sufficient action. Thought warnings must be up to par, using cases to interpret discipline and law, and creating an atmosphere of reflection, warning, and vigilance. Lead verification must be up to par, and we must dig deep regarding the problems mentioned in the Central Circular and regarding the leads to issues found in retrospective reviews and approvals of relevant units. The investigation and handling of “persons, matters, and cases” must be up to par. We must comprehensively investigate key personnel who have been in close contact with or have associated with Sun Lijun’s political gang, and we must severely investigate and deal with violations of discipline and law.
The most prominent task of political building work: To solve the problem of deficiencies in our systems, mechanisms and institutions, truly addressing shortcomings, strengthening points of weakness, plugging loopholes, and preventing risks
Draw lessons from the failures of that which proceeds us. To strengthen political building work, we must thoroughly analyze the deep-seated reasons for Sun Lijun’s political gang and the serious violations of discipline and law by leading politics and law cadres since the 18th Party Congress. We must pinpoint the crux of the problem, strengthen efforts to grasp the source and cure the root cause of problems, and effectively improve the systems, mechanisms, and institutions for comprehensively and strictly governing the Party and the police.
We must address “the weak sense of absolute Party leadership.” Adhering to the Party’s absolute leadership is the fundamental principle of politics and law work in the new era. For a period of time before now, some politics and law units have failed to diligently and satisfactorily study and implement the Regulations of the Chinese Communist Party on Politics and Law Work, and the systems for the Party’s absolute leadership have not been sufficiently sound. It is necessary to thoroughly implement the Regulations, comprehensively strengthen the Party’s leadership of politics and law work in terms of politics, ideology, organization and work style, implement it in all aspects and whole processes of politics and law work, and give full play to the leadership role of politics and law units’ Party committees (Party groups) in law enforcement and justice.
We must resolve the “erosion of ideals.” Ultimately, the corruption and degeneration of Party members and cadres is due to a decline of ideals and a wavering of beliefs. In times of peace, politics and law ranks must face not only “high winds and raging fires” but also many “temptations and traps.” The “master switch” of ideals and beliefs must be utterly unshakable. We must treat education on ideals and beliefs as a strategic initiative to consolidate the foundation, cultivate the mind, and forge the spirit. Guide politics and law cadres to diligently sweep away “ideological dust,” to think hard on “greed and desire,” and often vanquish the “thieves within our hearts.” Settle “political accounts, economic accounts, reputation accounts, accounts at home and within extended families, accounts of freedom, and health accounts” and from therein obtain powerful antibodies against erosion and degeneration and truly measure up to having rock-solid ideals and beliefs.
We must address “improper promotions.” Corruption and malpractice in the selection and deployment of people are akin to chronic toxicity, and the damage to the political ecology is systematic and long-term. We must strictly implement the Party’s policy on cadres, improve the systems for supervising, placing checks on, and pursuing accountability for personnel selection and deployment, and carry out retrospective investigations of “improper promotions.” Insist on putting political standards first and conduct in-depth and practical inspections of the political character of cadres, highlight good gatekeeping on politics and integrity, and implement a “one-vote veto” for those who are politically unqualified, using upright practices in the environment for using personnel to promote the good cleanly landscape of the political ecosystem.
We must resolve the “lack of supervision.” It is an iron law that power which lacks supervision inevitably leads to corruption. If supervision is properly maintained, once a nascent problem is identified, early warnings will be triggered, and it may be possible to make some politics and law cadres who have lost their way come to their senses, and rein in their horses at the precipice’s edge. To prevent the abuse of power, the key is to improve supervision and restriction mechanisms and form a synergy of supervision. We must strengthen supervision of leadership teams, especially “Number Ones.” “Number Ones” should not only accept supervision consciously but also pay attention to enforcing supervision. Enhance the political, up-to-date, principled, and combative nature of intra-party political life and improve capacity to discover and solve the problems of leadership teams themselves. Strictly implement the Central Committee’s Eight-Point Provisions, strengthen top-down supervision, make good use of internal inspections, resolutely eliminate the notion of privilege, and persevere in rectifying the “Four Malfeasances.”
We must resolve the dilemma of “attempting to confine cats within a cattle pen.” “Cats cannot be confined within a cattle pen”—with gaps that are too large, cats can come and go freely. Powers of law enforcement and judicial powers are highly specialized and discretionary; if the institutional cage is not tightly woven, corruption is unavoidable. We must take the comprehensive deepening of political and legal reform as the starting point, constantly improve the operation mechanisms of law enforcement and judicial powers and the restriction and supervision systems, and truly use an institutional cage to control power. Improve the list of powers and responsibilities for law enforcement and case handling, regularly conduct random checks, evaluations, and retrospective inspections on the quality of law enforcement and judicial cases, improve standardized management systems for people, property, and goods, and strictly prevent the use of power for personal gain. Strengthen the binding nature of system implementation, rigorously investigate and rectify problems such as arbitrary flexibility, malicious evasion, and disregard for the system, and strictly implement the “Ten Prohibitions” for politics and law workers in the new era so as to truly give teeth to and electrify the system.
We must resolve the problem of “weak accountability.” Without accountability, responsibility can easily become nothing but empty words, and responsibilities for the comprehensive and strict management of the Party and police will not be implemented well. Dare to hold people accountable, conscientiously implement the Accountability Regulations of the Chinese Communist Party, and in cases of weakened Party leadership, lack of Party building, and ineffectiveness in comprehensively and strictly governing the Party, comply with the principle that failures must be met with accountability and accountability must be strictly enforced. Excel in accountability, improve the mechanisms for initiating law enforcement and judicial accountability, lifelong accountability systems for the quality of case handling, retrospective accountability mechanisms for wrongful cases, and disciplinary mechanisms to ensure that law enforcement and judicial responsibilities are implemented concretely and that punishments can reach specific individuals.
The most thorough strategy for resolving root causes in political building: Continuously promote self-revolution on the politics and law front and ensure that the politics and law ranks do not deteriorate, decline, or degrade
Persistence in self-revolution is the second answer given by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core on how to break out of the historical cycle. Carrying out the education and rectification of the politics and law ranks is a beneficial exploration in Party self-revolution on the politics and law front in the new era. The politics and law front must thoroughly study and implement General Secretary Xi Jinping’s strategic thinking on self-revolution, consolidate and deepen the educational and rectification achievements of the politics and law ranks, unswervingly promote self-revolution, and forever maintain the loyal, pure, and reliable political character of the politics and law ranks.
We must strengthen the ideological consciousness and political initiative of self-revolution. The fight against corruption has won an overwhelming victory, but the fight never ends. At present, the soil that breeds corruption has not been completely eradicated, and formalism, bureaucratism, privileged thinking, and the phenomenon of privilege still exist. The outstanding problems existing in the politics and law ranks cannot be completely cured by a single centralized round of education and rectification and cannot be expected to be defeated in one battle. It is necessary to strengthen consciousness and initiative for self-revolution, combine centralized education and rectification with normalized solving of emerging problems, not only using strong measures to address prominent problems in a concentrated way but also frequently sweeping away ideological, organizational, disciplinary, and work style “dust.” We must work hard to treat minor illnesses and cure irregularities.
We must grasp the goals, requirements, and basic tasks of self-revolution. Be committed to self-purification, self-betterment, self-innovation, and self-improvement and forever maintain the Party’s advanced nature and purity so that the “knife handles” of politics and law never rust. Be committed to self-purification, maintain a high-pressure campaign against corruption, adhere to the tenets of no restricted areas, full coverage, and zero tolerance, investigate “two-faced people” who are disloyal and dishonest to the Party, thoroughly investigate law enforcement and judicial corruption, and strictly investigate corruption that has not be reined in since the 18th Party Congress so as to eliminate the black sheep and maintain the health of the politics and law ranks. Be committed to self-betterment, use systems to address shortcomings, strengthen points of weakness, plug loopholes, and prevent risks, and strive to ensure that we “do not dare, are not able, and do not want to be corrupt,” promoting these goals simultaneously. Be committed to self-innovation, resolutely eliminate all outdated ideological concepts and institutional ailments, resolutely rectify formalism and bureaucratism, and resolutely rectify unhealthy trends, especially stubborn diseases. Be committed to self-improvement, strengthen ideological tempering, political experience, practical exercise, and professional training and continuously improve the ability and quality of politics and law ranks.
Master the important principles and main strategies of self-revolution. Adhere to the unity of the Party’s leadership and the resolution of intra-party problems, the integration of organizational promotion and individual initiative, and the coordination of principled policy and strategic flexibility to promote a deepening and solidification of the concrete practice of self-revolution. Adhere to communication between upper and lower levels, integrate a strengthening of top-level design with encouragement for local exploration, strengthen Party leadership, pay attention to higher-level supervision and guidance, and build a communication mechanism of “supervising subordinates from above and pressing superiors from below” so as to achieve full-chain synergy and system-wide advancement. Adhere to the integration of leniency and strictness, pair “leniency in self-examination” with “strictness in investigation.” Guide by “leniency in self-examination” and enforce with “strictness in investigation.” Make coordinated use of the “Four Forms” to achieve the purpose of educating the vast majority and punishing the select few. Adhere to both breaking and establishing, combining the rectification of prominent problems with the establishment of rules and regulations, not only scraping poison from the bones but also treating the root causes. Excel at integrating effective innovative measures and raising them into institutional mechanisms. Adhere to mutual promotion internally and externally, combining self-revolution with supervision by the people, actively exploring new forms and new measures to receive supervision by the people, and wholeheartedly taking on the role of good public servants of the people, forever remaining loyal to the Party and never letting down the people.

The most thorough strategy for resolving root causes in political building: Continuously promote self-revolution on the politics and law front and ensure that the politics and law ranks do not deteriorate, decline, or degrade
Persistence in self-revolution is the second answer given by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core on how to break out of the historical cycle. Carrying out the education and rectification of the politics and law ranks is a beneficial exploration in Party self-revolution on the politics and law front in the new era. The politics and law front must thoroughly study and implement General Secretary Xi Jinping’s strategic thinking on self-revolution, consolidate and deepen the educational and rectification achievements of the politics and law ranks, unswervingly promote self-revolution, and forever maintain the loyal, pure, and reliable political character of the politics and law ranks.
We must strengthen the ideological consciousness and political initiative of self-revolution. The fight against corruption has won an overwhelming victory, but the fight never ends. At present, the soil that breeds corruption has not been completely eradicated, and formalism, bureaucratism, privileged thinking, and the phenomenon of privilege still exist. The outstanding problems existing in the politics and law ranks cannot be completely cured by a single centralized round of education and rectification and cannot be expected to be defeated in one battle. It is necessary to strengthen consciousness and initiative for self-revolution, combine centralized education and rectification with normalized solving of emerging problems, not only using strong measures to address prominent problems in a concentrated way but also frequently sweeping away ideological, organizational, disciplinary, and work style “dust.” We must work hard to treat minor illnesses and cure irregularities.
We must grasp the goals, requirements, and basic tasks of self-revolution. Be committed to self-purification, self-betterment, self-innovation, and self-improvement and forever maintain the Party’s advanced nature and purity so that the “knife handles” of politics and law never rust. Be committed to self-purification, maintain a high-pressure campaign against corruption, adhere to the tenets of no restricted areas, full coverage, and zero tolerance, investigate “two-faced people” who are disloyal and dishonest to the Party, thoroughly investigate law enforcement and judicial corruption, and strictly investigate corruption that has not be reined in since the 18th Party Congress so as to eliminate the black sheep and maintain the health of the politics and law ranks. Be committed to self-betterment, use systems to address shortcomings, strengthen points of weakness, plug loopholes, and prevent risks, and strive to ensure that we “do not dare, are not able, and do not want to be corrupt,” promoting these goals simultaneously. Be committed to self-innovation, resolutely eliminate all outdated ideological concepts and institutional ailments, resolutely rectify formalism and bureaucratism, and resolutely rectify unhealthy trends, especially stubborn diseases. Be committed to self-improvement, strengthen ideological tempering, political experience, practical exercise, and professional training and continuously improve the ability and quality of politics and law ranks.
Master the important principles and main strategies of self-revolution. Adhere to the unity of the Party’s leadership and the resolution of intra-party problems, the integration of organizational promotion and individual initiative, and the coordination of principled policy and strategic flexibility to promote a deepening and solidification of the concrete practice of self-revolution. Adhere to communication between upper and lower levels, integrate a strengthening of top-level design with encouragement for local exploration, strengthen Party leadership, pay attention to higher-level supervision and guidance, and build a communication mechanism of “supervising subordinates from above and pressing superiors from below” so as to achieve full-chain synergy and system-wide advancement. Adhere to the integration of leniency and strictness, pair “leniency in self-examination” with “strictness in investigation.” Guide by “leniency in self-examination” and enforce with “strictness in investigation.” Make coordinated use of the “Four Forms” to achieve the purpose of educating the vast majority and punishing the select few. Adhere to both breaking and establishing, combining the rectification of prominent problems with the establishment of rules and regulations, not only scraping poison from the bones but also treating the root causes. Excel at integrating effective innovative measures and raising them into institutional mechanisms. Adhere to mutual promotion internally and externally, combining self-revolution with supervision by the people, actively exploring new forms and new measures to receive supervision by the people, and wholeheartedly taking on the role of good public servants of the people, forever remaining loyal to the Party and never letting down the people.

Chen Yixin: Taking the Defense of the “Two Affirmations” and Achieving the “Two Upholds” as the Fundamental Requirement of Political Work on the Politics and Law Front,"Chang'an Net , Chen Yixin","Jul 27, 2022","
Political building is the fundamental building work of the Party. Since the 18th Party Congress, General Secretary Xi Jinping has made a series of important expositions on strengthening political building, making original contributions to the development of Marxist party building ideas and providing the fundamental guidelines for advancing political building in the new era. Strengthening political building is an inevitable requirement for comprehensively and strictly governing the Party and the police, and it is an eternal and critical issue of the politics and law front. We must adhere to strengthening political building as the guide, deeply understand the decisive significance of the “Two Affirmations,” resolutely live up to the “Two Upholds,” forever maintain a political character of loyalty, cleanliness, and responsibility, and help “China’s governance” to create new miracles.
The most fundamental guide to political building work: Arm the mind with Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, strengthen the political consciousness of casting the soul and strengthening the body
Political resolve stems from theoretical clarity. Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is the latest achievement of the Sinification and modernization of Marxism, the essence for our times of Chinese culture and Chinese spirit, the ideological banner that guides the Chinese nation to grow strong, and the guide to action for the people of the nation to march towards the second centenary goal. We must treat studying deeply, understanding thoroughly, and putting into action Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as our own political requirements, work needs, and spiritual pursuits. We must strengthen the endogenous driving force for the study of the Party’s innovative theory and constantly seek practical results in the combination of “learning, understanding, research, and application.” We must take the lead in being firm believers, active disseminators, and faithful practitioners of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.
Be committed to the pairing of study with understanding to promote comprehension. Be committed to reading more of the original works, diligently studying original texts, and deeply understanding the principles, earnestly studying the significance, scientific system, essence, and practical requirements of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and deeply comprehending its original contribution to the Sinification and modernization of Marxism. Deeply understand the truth that when it comes to “why the Chinese Communist Party can, and why socialism with Chinese characteristics is good, ultimately, it is because Marxism is great.” Instill this in your mind and take this truth to heart.
Be committed to the pairing of study with research to promote deepening. Accurately grasp the Marxist epistemology contained in Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and continuously deepen understanding and research on the laws of the Communist Party’s governance, the laws of socialist construction, and the laws of the development of human society. Consciously use Marxist standpoints, viewpoints, and methods, deepen research on “the great matters of the nation” (国之大者), deepen research on major theoretical and practical issues in the field of politics and law, and better grasp the laws of politics and law work in the new era.
Be committed to the pairing of study with application to promote transformations. Promote the learning style of linking theory with practice and strive to transform achievements in studying and implementing Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era into political consciousness regarding strengthening the “Four Consciousnesses,” firming up the “Four Matters of Confidence,” and achieving the “Two Upholds.” Transform such achievements into innovative ideas for promoting the high-quality development of politics and law work. Transform such achievements into effective measures for promoting self-revolution on the politics and law front; and transform them into a strong capacity for preventing risks, ensuring security, and protecting stability, striving to build a higher level of security for China.
The most important requirements of political building: Resolutely achieving the “Two Upholds” and resolutely obeying the command of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core
The politics and law front must treat achieving the “Two Upholds” as the top priority of strengthening political building, implement this throughout all aspects and the whole process of performing duties and responsibilities, and resolutely safeguard General Secretary Xi Jinping’s status as the core of the Party Central Committee and the core of the whole party.
In terms of sentiment, wholeheartedly embrace the core. The Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core has led the whole Party and the people of the whole nation to usher in a new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, opening up a new realm of Sinification and modernization of Marxism, creating a new great cause to achieve the first centenary goal, and launching a new journey in the march towards the second centenary goal. The Chinese nation has ushered in a great leap, from standing up and becoming rich, to becoming strong. General Secretary Xi Jinping’s great prestige, leadership style, outstanding wisdom, charisma, and feelings for the people have become a huge spiritual force that inspires and motivates us. We sincerely feel that the fact that General Secretary Xi Jinping has become the popularly supported and well-deserved core of the Party, people’s leader, and commander-in-chief of the army is the great fortune of the Party, the country, and the people. We must always be loyally devoted to protecting the core and embracing the core.
Mentally, always keep close to the core. In the face of great changes unseen in a century, the closer we get to our goal, the more complex the situation and the more arduous the task, the more we need General Secretary Xi Jinping to be at the helm to navigate and the more we need the steadying role of the CCP Central Committee’s centralized and unified leadership. The politics and law front must unremittingly arm our minds with Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and make timely efforts to follow, study and implement General Secretary Xi Jinping’s new ideas, new thoughts, and new strategies, and fully understand what General Secretary Xi Jinping is concerned with and is emphasizing. We must consolidate the ideological foundation of aligning with the core and listening to the command of the Party Central Committee, ensuring that new-era politics and law work always moves ahead in the right direction as pointed out by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
Politically, remain absolutely loyal to the core. Building political loyalty is the primary task of building an invincible political and legal army. Achieving the “Two Upholds” is the most fundamental requirement of political loyalty. The politics and law front must treat achieving the “Two Upholds” as the basic political norm to abide by, as the fundamental political requirement to implement, and as the greatest political discipline and political rule to enforce. We must always maintain a high degree of consistency with the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core in terms of political position, political direction, political principles, and political path.
In action, resolutely defend the core. Being committed to achieving the “Two Upholds” means it is imperative to put them into action. The politics and law front must thoroughly implement the important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping and the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee. We must resolutely obey the orders of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core, ensuring that we resolutely respond to what the Party Central Committee advocates, resolutely comply with what the Party Central Committee decides, and resolutely put a stop to what the Party Central Committee prohibits. We must resolutely oppose words and actions that undermine the Party’s centralized, unified leadership, resolutely struggle against phenomena that affect the unity of the Party, and resolutely eradicate risks and hidden troubles that affect national political security.
The most urgent issue of political building work: thoroughly eliminate the toxic effects of Sun Lijun’s political gang and effectively optimize the political ecology of politics and law organs
The earnest investigation and punishment of Sun Lijun’s political gang fully demonstrates the firm determination of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core to comprehensively and strictly govern the Party. The politics and law front must be certain to completely eliminate the toxic influence of Sun Lijun’s political gang, use cases to warn, use cases to promote reform, and use cases to promote governance so as thoroughly “detoxify” and purify the political ecology of politics and law organs.
Recognize the critical nature of “detoxification.” Sun Lijun’s political gang is a typical example of disloyalty and dishonesty to the Party and the “Seven Presences [of Political Misbehaviours]” (“七个有之”).  It is a typical example of the intertwining of political and economic problems and extreme corruption and degeneracy. It is a typical example of aggressively engaging in privileges, acting recklessly, and flagrantly violating discipline and law as enforcement is being tightened. Completely eradicating the toxic influence of Sun Lijun’s political gang is an inevitable requirement for ensuring that the “knife handle” is firmly in the hands of the Party and the people and is the top priority of politics and law organs for creating a clean and upright political ecology. We must deepen our understanding politically, and we must take the complete eradication of the poisonous influence as an urgent and serious political task.
Face square on the complexity of “detoxification.” Since the launch of efforts to earnestly eradicate the poison, relevant localities and units have attached great importance to it and achieved good results, but the task of “detoxification” is still formidable and complicated. Sun Lijun’s political gang is a cancer that seriously endangers the health of the Party’s whole. The poison has affected politics and law workers in certain localities and departments. We must keep a clear head and face square on the seriousness of the “toxic disease” and the breadth of “toxicity,” and resolutely avoid negative phenomena such as passing over issues prematurely, “turning a blind eye,” or responding unevenly.
Be committed to the thoroughness of “detoxification.” To eradicate the poisonous influence of Sun Lijun’s political gang, we must never just go where the wind takes us and must never act superficially; we must take swift, concrete, and sufficient action. Thought warnings must be up to par, using cases to interpret discipline and law, and creating an atmosphere of reflection, warning, and vigilance. Lead verification must be up to par, and we must dig deep regarding the problems mentioned in the Central Circular and regarding the leads to issues found in retrospective reviews and approvals of relevant units. The investigation and handling of “persons, matters, and cases” must be up to par. We must comprehensively investigate key personnel who have been in close contact with or have associated with Sun Lijun’s political gang, and we must severely investigate and deal with violations of discipline and law.
The most prominent task of political building work: To solve the problem of deficiencies in our systems, mechanisms and institutions, truly addressing shortcomings, strengthening points of weakness, plugging loopholes, and preventing risks
Draw lessons from the failures of that which proceeds us. To strengthen political building work, we must thoroughly analyze the deep-seated reasons for Sun Lijun’s political gang and the serious violations of discipline and law by leading politics and law cadres since the 18th Party Congress. We must pinpoint the crux of the problem, strengthen efforts to grasp the source and cure the root cause of problems, and effectively improve the systems, mechanisms, and institutions for comprehensively and strictly governing the Party and the police.
We must address “the weak sense of absolute Party leadership.” Adhering to the Party’s absolute leadership is the fundamental principle of politics and law work in the new era. For a period of time before now, some politics and law units have failed to diligently and satisfactorily study and implement the Regulations of the Chinese Communist Party on Politics and Law Work, and the systems for the Party’s absolute leadership have not been sufficiently sound. It is necessary to thoroughly implement the Regulations, comprehensively strengthen the Party’s leadership of politics and law work in terms of politics, ideology, organization and work style, implement it in all aspects and whole processes of politics and law work, and give full play to the leadership role of politics and law units’ Party committees (Party groups) in law enforcement and justice.
We must resolve the “erosion of ideals.” Ultimately, the corruption and degeneration of Party members and cadres is due to a decline of ideals and a wavering of beliefs. In times of peace, politics and law ranks must face not only “high winds and raging fires” but also many “temptations and traps.” The “master switch” of ideals and beliefs must be utterly unshakable. We must treat education on ideals and beliefs as a strategic initiative to consolidate the foundation, cultivate the mind, and forge the spirit. Guide politics and law cadres to diligently sweep away “ideological dust,” to think hard on “greed and desire,” and often vanquish the “thieves within our hearts.” Settle “political accounts, economic accounts, reputation accounts, accounts at home and within extended families, accounts of freedom, and health accounts” and from therein obtain powerful antibodies against erosion and degeneration and truly measure up to having rock-solid ideals and beliefs.
We must address “improper promotions.” Corruption and malpractice in the selection and deployment of people are akin to chronic toxicity, and the damage to the political ecology is systematic and long-term. We must strictly implement the Party’s policy on cadres, improve the systems for supervising, placing checks on, and pursuing accountability for personnel selection and deployment, and carry out retrospective investigations of “improper promotions.” Insist on putting political standards first and conduct in-depth and practical inspections of the political character of cadres, highlight good gatekeeping on politics and integrity, and implement a “one-vote veto” for those who are politically unqualified, using upright practices in the environment for using personnel to promote the good cleanly landscape of the political ecosystem.
We must resolve the “lack of supervision.” It is an iron law that power which lacks supervision inevitably leads to corruption. If supervision is properly maintained, once a nascent problem is identified, early warnings will be triggered, and it may be possible to make some politics and law cadres who have lost their way come to their senses, and rein in their horses at the precipice’s edge. To prevent the abuse of power, the key is to improve supervision and restriction mechanisms and form a synergy of supervision. We must strengthen supervision of leadership teams, especially “Number Ones.” “Number Ones” should not only accept supervision consciously but also pay attention to enforcing supervision. Enhance the political, up-to-date, principled, and combative nature of intra-party political life and improve capacity to discover and solve the problems of leadership teams themselves. Strictly implement the Central Committee’s Eight-Point Provisions, strengthen top-down supervision, make good use of internal inspections, resolutely eliminate the notion of privilege, and persevere in rectifying the “Four Malfeasances.”
We must resolve the dilemma of “attempting to confine cats within a cattle pen.” “Cats cannot be confined within a cattle pen”—with gaps that are too large, cats can come and go freely. Powers of law enforcement and judicial powers are highly specialized and discretionary; if the institutional cage is not tightly woven, corruption is unavoidable. We must take the comprehensive deepening of political and legal reform as the starting point, constantly improve the operation mechanisms of law enforcement and judicial powers and the restriction and supervision systems, and truly use an institutional cage to control power. Improve the list of powers and responsibilities for law enforcement and case handling, regularly conduct random checks, evaluations, and retrospective inspections on the quality of law enforcement and judicial cases, improve standardized management systems for people, property, and goods, and strictly prevent the use of power for personal gain. Strengthen the binding nature of system implementation, rigorously investigate and rectify problems such as arbitrary flexibility, malicious evasion, and disregard for the system, and strictly implement the “Ten Prohibitions” for politics and law workers in the new era so as to truly give teeth to and electrify the system.
We must resolve the problem of “weak accountability.” Without accountability, responsibility can easily become nothing but empty words, and responsibilities for the comprehensive and strict management of the Party and police will not be implemented well. Dare to hold people accountable, conscientiously implement the Accountability Regulations of the Chinese Communist Party, and in cases of weakened Party leadership, lack of Party building, and ineffectiveness in comprehensively and strictly governing the Party, comply with the principle that failures must be met with accountability and accountability must be strictly enforced. Excel in accountability, improve the mechanisms for initiating law enforcement and judicial accountability, lifelong accountability systems for the quality of case handling, retrospective accountability mechanisms for wrongful cases, and disciplinary mechanisms to ensure that law enforcement and judicial responsibilities are implemented concretely and that punishments can reach specific individuals.
The most thorough strategy for resolving root causes in political building: Continuously promote self-revolution on the politics and law front and ensure that the politics and law ranks do not deteriorate, decline, or degrade

Be committed to self-improvement, strengthen ideological tempering, political experience, practical exercise, and professional training and continuously improve the ability and quality of politics and law ranks.
Master the important principles and main strategies of self-revolution. Adhere to the unity of the Party’s leadership and the resolution of intra-party problems, the integration of organizational promotion and individual initiative, and the coordination of principled policy and strategic flexibility to promote a deepening and solidification of the concrete practice of self-revolution. Adhere to communication between upper and lower levels, integrate a strengthening of top-level design with encouragement for local exploration, strengthen Party leadership, pay attention to higher-level supervision and guidance, and build a communication mechanism of “supervising subordinates from above and pressing superiors from below” so as to achieve full-chain synergy and system-wide advancement. Adhere to the integration of leniency and strictness, pair “leniency in self-examination” with “strictness in investigation.” Guide by “leniency in self-examination” and enforce with “strictness in investigation.” Make coordinated use of the “Four Forms” to achieve the purpose of educating the vast majority and punishing the select few. Adhere to both breaking and establishing, combining the rectification of prominent problems with the establishment of rules and regulations, not only scraping poison from the bones but also treating the root causes. Excel at integrating effective innovative measures and raising them into institutional mechanisms. Adhere to mutual promotion internally and externally, combining self-revolution with supervision by the people, actively exploring new forms and new measures to receive supervision by the people, and wholeheartedly taking on the role of good public servants of the people, forever remaining loyal to the Party and never letting down the people.

China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","What sort of internal and external risks will China face in the new period? These risks arise from only two areas, namely, changes in the internal and external objective environments and incorrect coping strategies. On the whole, since entering the new period, the internal and external risks that China has faced still center on the “two traps” that have been discussed for many years before and after the 18th Party Congress, namely, the internal “middle-income trap” and the external “Thucydides trap.”"
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","The risks of these two “traps” are two-fold. On the one hand, many objective circumstances may cause the country to fall into these two “traps.” On the other hand, on the subjective level, no effective policies have been found to avoid these two traps. The decision-making error in this latter aspect is the “fatal mistake” that has been discussed in the past few years. This article will discuss the “middle-income trap”; the “Thucydides trap” will be discussed in another article."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","Before and after the 18th Party Congress, people argued about the “middle-income trap” for many years. They are not arguing anymore. There are two reasons the argument stopped. First, in recent years some people have grown overly optimistic. They believe that China has escaped the middle-income trap and is already at the lower end of developed economies. Given that the trap has been avoided, there is no need to discuss it. Second, the argument cannot be had. China has no shortage of pessimists, but pessimism can easily be seen as political incorrectness. However, with the sudden changes in the current internal and external environment, people are beginning to feel that the country is not far from either the “middle-income trap” or the “Thucydides trap.” Without strong policies, it will be difficult to avoid falling into these traps."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","So, where is the core of the “middle-income trap” crisis? The crisis has many roots, but its main manifestation is the crisis of non-development. Since reform and opening up, “development is the top priority” (发展是硬道理) has always been the primary consideration for important decisions. As a developing country, Chinese society faces endless problems. This is not surprising, as this is the case with any society. However, China’s success lies in continuous development. All problems find solutions in the process of development. However, once there is a problem with development itself, resulting in a situation of non-development, all the other problems will rise to the surface. Not only will they remain unresolved, but they will even worsen and eventually become crises."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","Like other problems, the “middle-income trap” must be avoided through sustainable development. After the 18th Party Congress, China’s economic development entered a new normal, that is, from the high double-digit growth of the past to less than 7%, which is medium-speed growth. This transition was inevitable because no economy can sustain high growth permanently. Be it the environment, energy, or human resources, all would struggle to sustain such continuous high growth. More importantly, in the high growth stage, people do not pay enough attention to an important question, that is, what kind of high growth is needed? If high growth leads to a high degree of social differentiation, environmental degradation, and resource exhaustion, such high growth is not only unsustainable, but also “bad” high growth. Therefore, the 17th Party Congress posed the question “What kind of development should we achieve?” and the focus of national policy began to shift to social distribution. In recent years, the state has put forward the policy goal of transitioning from a quantity economy to a quality economy."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","However, even with moderate growth, if China can maintain a growth rate of 6% to 7% for the next 10 to 15 years, then it can still escape the middle-income trap and enter the ranks of developed economies. The 19th Party Congress planned a vision for national development from 2017 to 2050, which called for the achievement of a moderately prosperous society in all respects by 2020, the basic achievement of socialist modernization by 2035, and the achievement of a great modern socialist country that is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious, and beautiful by 2050."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","We can expect that, by 2035, mainland China will be upgraded to a developed economy, at least at the level of the last (Taiwan) of today’s “Four Little Dragons” economies (South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Taiwan), which is about U.S. $25,000 per capita. Today, the national per capita income in mainland China today is more than U.S. $9,000. Although there is still a long way to go to reach the level of Taiwan, if the “package” of economic development policies since the 18th Party Congress can continue to be effectively implemented, this goal will not be difficult to achieve."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019",Reasons to worry about the “middle income trap”
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","So why are people now worried about the coming of the “middle-income trap”? Here, there are the factors of internal bureaucratic inaction and changes in the external international environment."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","The bureaucracy is what implements policy. Why is it inactive? There are reasons related to both decision-making and to execution. In terms of decision-making, in recent years it has become very important to emphasize the top-level design of policies. Because reforms have reached this stage—the stage of “comprehensive deepening”—sporadic reforms led by departments and local governments are difficult to sustain. However, the “top-level” nature of decision-making often leads some policies to lack scientificity and implementability. For example, if free trade zone policies are too broad and the costs of trial and error are not fully considered, this results in the inability to fully delegate many powers. The reason is simple. If these powers were all delegated, the entire national economy would be affected. Because no one can guarantee the success of a free trade zone, it is not unreasonable that some departments are wary of delegating power."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","Another example is targeted poverty alleviation, which is extremely important because it is related to social fairness and stability. However, in many areas, the policy designs are too idealistic, approaching a “Utopia,” understanding targeted poverty alleviation as the complete eradication of poverty. But the fact is that even the richest society still has a considerable number of poor people, and no society in the world is entirely without any poor people. In order to achieve a society without poor people, many places have mobilized their greatest efforts for poverty alleviation. Yet mobilization-style poverty alleviation soon caused “fatigue” among poverty alleviation personnel, leading to a transition to formulaic poverty alleviation during the implementation process. Now, some places are beginning to worry that once the government stops its “blood transfusion,” there will be a large-scale “return of poverty.”"
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","Moreover, in terms of decision-making, at some levels of government, these years have also seen a tendency for pursuing policy quantity while ignoring policy quality. One reason for this is that some people understand “comprehensively deepening reforms” in terms of numbers and pursue the quantity of decisions, thinking that the more policies there are, the more comprehensive reforms will be. In fact, “comprehensively deepening reforms” does not imply that all the areas specified for reform are of equal importance and urgency. Policies must pay attention to “breakthrough points.” Or as we used to say, “Once the headrope of a fishing net is pulled out, all its meshes open” (纲举目张, a metaphor for making widespread changes by acting on a single key point). No one can comprehensively promote reform without assigning priorities."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","In addition, the quality of policies often does not depend on their logic in theory; it relies more on their logic in practice. A policy can have strong theoretical logic without necessarily having practical logic. A policy that does not conform to practical logic is often unimplementable. There are too many policies and the policies are not implemented, which has led policies to lose credibility. This brings about the so-called “Tacitus trap,” where people do not believe in the policies formulated by the government."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","In terms of difficulties in policy implementation, there are also many reasons, but one of them is that scientific power supervision mechanisms do not yet measure up. Be it to fight corruption or to overcome the resistance of vested interests to reform, highly centralized power supervision mechanisms are needed. To this end, based on prior local practice, the 19th Party Congress established supervisory authority, indicating that an internal three-power system is in place, namely decision-making, execution, and supervision. This system is of milestone significance to China’s long-term security. However, the boundary between the three powers, the internal operating mechanisms, and the relationships between the three powers must all undergo a long period of exploration. Currently, once supervisory authority becomes excessive, or it can supervise anything, the executive power then becomes “idle.”"
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","In practice, if reforms are to be made or a policy to be implemented, there is inevitably a risk of making mistakes. Once mistakes are made, they must be supervised. To a large extent, if the sole responsibility of supervision agencies is to find the “mistakes” of policy implementers, then they are certain to be able to find “mistakes.” This is just like in a multi-party system with “mutual vetoes,” where an opposition party will always be able to find high-sounding reasons to oppose the ruling party. At present, in many areas of China, you could say that there are more people who complain than people who work, and complaining costs nothing. Under these circumstances, many bureaucrats rationally choose not to act. Although “inaction” comes with its own risks, the risk of “inaction” is still lower than the risk of making a “mistake.” Although the central government has also issued documents to tolerate “trial and error” in reforms, none of these documents have legal significance and will not easily change the actual behavior of the executors."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","In addition, the risk of the “middle-income trap” has greatly increased due to the international environment and geopolitics, especially the recent U.S.-China trade war and other factors (how external factors affect China’s “middle-income trap” need discussing separately)."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019",How to avoid falling into the “middle-income trap”
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","Internally speaking, in the present situation, how can we avoid the “fatal mistake” of falling into the “middle-income trap” through policy changes? At the very least, we can consider the following aspects."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","First, we must correctly understand “top-level design.” “Top-level design” cannot be simply understood as “upper-level design,” or as the designs of a few people from behind closed doors. Effective policies must be a combination of both bottom-up and top-down. At the same time, achieving scientific top-level design would be difficult without extensive research and investigation."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","Second, decision-making needs to transition from quantity to quality. Although reforms need to overcome piecemeal implementation and make comprehensive progress, it is vital to find effective breakthrough points among the numerous policies. Comprehensive advancement with and without breakthrough points produces different results."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","Third, the central government should focus on the general direction, while the executive departments should concentrate on the details. Currently, many policies concentrate too much on the macro-level, are too theoretical, or are even too ideological, and lack executable details. Policies without details are not only difficult to implement, but will also be bent out of shape in the implementation process. Moreover, policy details require the participation of professionals. In terms of the relationship between the central and local governments, many policies require more local participation."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","Fourth, in many fields, the state needs local policies. China’s size determines the importance of its localities. Since the reform and opening up, it is difficult to understand the huge social and economic changes in China without considering local initiative. Although in some areas, such as finance and the rule of law, the role of the central government is becoming increasingly important, meaning there is a need for centralization of power, many policy areas still require local governments to play a primary role, such as local economic and social services. In these areas, the local government is the main actor, and the central government is the supervisor."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","Fifth, policy review and evaluation are required. In recent years, a great deal of effort has been made to adjust the economic structure, but the results have been less than ideal. For example, everyone is aware that the focus should be on the development of the real economy and that we need to curb the excessive financial and Internet economies, but after so many years, the focus on finance and the Internet to the detriment of the real economy remains unchanged, and most financial strength has not flowed into the real economy. Why is this?"
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","Sixth, policy implementation needs to allow all actors to take action. This requires selective centralization and selective delegation of power. Power that should be centralized should be centralized, and power that should be delegated should be delegated. As stipulated by the Third Plenum after the 18th Party Congress, the relationship between the market and the government, and the relationship between the state and society, need to be transformed into practical and operational policies. In terms of actors, the situation in recent years has been one where the central government has taken action, but local governments, state-owned enterprises, private enterprises, and foreign-invested companies have struggled to take action, or have even not taken action. Since reform and opening up, these have been the main actors for policy implementation. If these actors fail to take action, policies will be nothing more than pieces of paper."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","Seventh, the most important thing is to establish a “government based on the rule of law” (法治政府) as stipulated by the Fourth Plenum after the 18th Party Congress. Whether it is the legitimacy or efficiency of government, both depend on government being based on the rule of law. In terms of the economy, government based on the rule of law is a regulatory government. The government needs not only to regulate the behavior of enterprises, but also to regulate its own behavior. Although building a regulatory government has long been a goal of reform, the government is still currently a control-type government (控制型政府). This is also the main reason why over the last few years it has remained difficult to decentralize despite the government itself advocating the “decentralization of approval power.” Under a regulatory-type government, the operating principles for enterprises should be “free entry, market first, government steps back, and effective supervision.” But under a control-type government, the government still stands at the door, keeping enterprises out. The same is true for society. If the government does not give society room to develop, society will never mature."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","Simply put, the government is a (rule of law) framework and should not concern itself with so many details. The details are the concern of the market and society. Without the market and society, there would be no dynamic mechanisms for sustainable development."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","The external risks of China’s new period refer to the “Thucydides trap.” This concerns how to avoid conflicts and even wars between China and the United States. Simply put, the “Thucydides trap” refers to the relationship between emerging powers and established powers. Whether due to an emerging power challenging an established power or to an established power that fears an emerging power, it is possible that this situation can eventually lead to conflicts and wars between the two."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","According to the statistics of a research team at Harvard University, the world has experienced 16 transfers of power between emerging and established powers since 1500. This has resulted in 12 wars, while only four transfers can be described as peaceful transfers. Over the past few years, whether China and the United States will fall into the “Thucydides trap” has become a hot topic of discussion for China and the United States, and even the world. Chinese President Xi Jinping himself has publicly stated a number of times that China must avoid this trap."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","How to avoid conflicts and wars between major powers has been the greatest concern of the Chinese leadership since opening up. How did reform and opening up become possible? The most important external condition was international peace. A peaceful international environment provided the conditions for China’s internal reform and opening up, and China must itself also contribute to international peace. This has basically become the highest principle in interactions between China and the outside world since reform and opening up. From Deng Xiaoping to the present day, the principles of China’s foreign policy have changed superficially, but their essential nature has remained internally consistent. In the Deng Xiaoping era, it was “hide your capacities and bide your time” (韬光养晦、有所作为), in the era of Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, it was “peaceful rise,” and since the 18th Party Congress, Xi Jinping proposed a “new type of major-country relationship” (新型大国关系). The essence of these policy goals is to properly handle external relations, especially relations between major powers."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","However, with the recent start of the trade war between the two major economies of China and the United States, people suddenly feel that the “Thucydides Trap” is approaching. In fact, there are already some people in the West who believe that China and the United States have already fallen into this trap, at least economically. The question is, why is it that the “Thucydides trap” has still emerged even though China has made so many efforts in this area? Many people point to reasons from China, believing that China has changed Deng Xiaoping’s strategy of “hide your capacities.” Perhaps, at the subjective level, policy is a reason, but the main factor is the change in objective factors. This can be understood from the evolution of the relations between China and the world."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","Simply put, the relationship between China and the U.S./Western-dominated world system has gone through three main stages. In the 1980s, when China was just embarking on reform and opening up, due to the shortage of capital, China implemented a “please come in” policy and opened its own door to welcome foreign capital to China. In the 1990s, China implemented a policy of “alignment” (接轨) in order to join the World Trade Organization. “Alignment” meant changing China’s own institutional system to conform to international rules."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","It is not difficult to understand that, in these two stages, China would not objectively have serious conflicts with the outside world. Not only that, whether for “opening up” or “alignment,” China was welcomed by the outside world. But now we are at the third stage, “going global.” “Going global” had already begun in the early 2000s, but the scale was small at first, and it was unlikely to have a substantial impact on the outside world. After the 18th Party Congress, China began to “go global” in a fairly systematic manner, and it became a national policy. This was particularly manifested in the “Belt and Road” initiative, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and the New Development Bank. The combination of excess capital, excess production capacity, and mature infrastructure construction technology constituted a massive driving force for “going global.”"
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","In the process, from the perspective of the West, China’s attitude towards the outside world has undergone a dramatic change. The West believes that the relationship between China and the world system has shifted from “learning,” “aligning,” and “maintaining” to “revisionism”. Internally, both officially and among the people, China’s diplomatic discourse has taken on an increasingly nationalistic color. China has begun to act like a “teacher” for the West. It has taught the West a lesson and begun to export its own “models,” whether economic development models or political system models."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","For the West, this turning point occurred in 2008, when a large-scale financial crisis occurred in the West. After this, most Western economies slumped and faced the difficulties of long-term structural adjustments. The “mutual veto” party system also made it difficult for Western countries to adopt effective national policies to lead their economies out of the crisis."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019",Trade war as a manifestation
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","Obviously, this contrast between China and the West is the result of both subjective cognitive components and more importantly changes in the objective environment. From this perspective, the trade war is not hard to understand. People could even say that the trade war is just a manifestation of the Sino-U.S. relationship at this stage. If it did not manifest as a trade war, it would have manifested in other forms."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","The nature of the Sino-U.S. relationship is manifested through the trade war. This indicates that the nature of the trade war is not merely economic, but the overall relationship between the two countries. What is the overall relationship between the two countries? Stated simply, as the world hegemon, the goal of the United States is to maintain its position as world hegemon. To maintain its hegemonic status, the United States must obstruct the challenge constituted by China, whether this challenge is real or imagined."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","Here, we need to make a judgment. Will there be a military conflict or even a war between China and the United States? Because China and the United States are both nuclear powers, the possibility of a hot war is extremely small. Local conflicts are possible, such as over problems in the South China Sea and Taiwan, but a full-scale war between the two countries is hard to imagine. Moreover, from the point of view of the United States, “conquering” China militarily is not only impossible, but also unnecessary. However, it is possible for relations between the two countries to develop from a local conflict to a military-political cold war. This is also the expectation of the hardline Cold War faction in the United States. The Cold War faction hopes that, whether through trade wars or other local conflicts, to lead Sino-U.S. relations to a military cold war. Once a military cold war occurs, the United States will deal with China just as it dealt with the Soviet Union in the past."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","Will the trade war turn into a military cold war? This depends on the next stage of interaction between China and the United States. From China’s perspective, what it needs to consider is how to prevent the trade war from turning into a military cold war while engaging in a trade war with the United States. Achieving this goal will require serious consideration of why Trump initiated this trade war."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","What is Trump afraid of from China? For Trump, China’s core strength lies in its gradually growing “consumer society.” What does China’s becoming a “consumer society” mean for the United States? This means that China has a “big market,” which means economic power. It is China’s massive “consumer market,” rather than other factors, that can really cause China to change the whole world structure. In recent years, China has more rapidly become a regional and even world economic center that can compete with the United States. The main reason for this is China’s consumption level."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","Therefore, it is not difficult to understand that the core of this trade war is a “technological cold war,” which targets “Made in China 2025.” In the end, through this “technological cold war,” the United States wants to stop China from improving its technological level, or at least to delay China’s modernization process. You could also say that what the United States needs to do is to push China into the “middle-income trap” or to push China back to the stage of “poor socialism.” As long as China remains in a state of “internal poverty,” China will have no external influence. From the U.S. perspective, China’s falling into the “middle-income trap” is the most effective way to prevent the two countries from falling into the “Thucydides trap.”"
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","Obviously, if China falls into the “middle-income trap” in the way that the United States hopes, and thus avoids the “Thucydides trap,” this would not be in China’s interests. Instead, it would be the minimization of China’s national interests. How can China avoid the occurrence of this situation? In a word, it is still necessary to resolve the contradiction between China and the United States through further reform and opening up, while simultaneously avoiding falling into the “middle-income trap” and “Thucydides trap.”"
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019",China should be clear about its own level of technological development
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","First, China needs to be clear about its own resources. For example, how far has its technology developed? If industry version 1.0 is defined as mechanization, version 2.0 is automation, version 3.0 is informatization, and version 4.0 is intelligentization, where exactly does China stand? Where are the gaps between China and the highest international level? How large are they?"
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","Realistically, most enterprises in China are located between mechanization and automation. Informatization and intelligentization are also in the process of development, but how much at these two levels is actually China’s own innovation? How much is the application of foreign technology? In which core technologies is China highly dependent on or even constrained by other countries, including the United States? In the event of a decoupling from U.S. technology, what kind of problems would the lack of these core technologies cause in China’s economic development and national security? Does China have ways to deal with these problems within a short period of time?"
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","This series of questions is very important when it comes to how to deal with the Sino-U.S. trade war. Although China’s economic construction in the past 40 years of reform and opening up has certainly made great achievements, in terms of technology, this was basically still the application of Western technology. Currently, there is still no “Made in China” in the true sense. After World War II, the economic take-off of countries such as Germany and Japan was indeed based on “Made in Germany” and “Made in Japan,” but this is not the case with China. In China, it was only “Processed in China” and “Assembled in China.” Only after we are clear about our own resources can we rationally evaluate the relationship between China and the United States."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019",How should we deal with the trade war?
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","To a certain extent, a trade war was inevitable, but it has to be a very limited trade war. China can fight a trade war in some areas where it can find alternative imports, such as agricultural products or automobiles, but it cannot fight a trade war in many technical fields because China itself does not have the technology. It is easier to find alternative imports for agricultural products. In terms of automobiles, countries such as Japan and Germany have the technology, and China can turn to imports from these countries."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","The rapid development of U.S. shale oil technology signifies the strengthening of U.S. energy export capacity. China can increase energy purchases and investment in the United States. Because the United States is unwilling to export high-tech products to China, and other commodities are insufficient to balance out the trade deficit between China and the United States, currently only bulk energy transactions can balance the deficit. The trade deficit is precisely what concerns Trump most in Sino-U.S. relations."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","In the trade war, we must pay attention to the role of multilateralism. After the United States officially initiated the trade war, China immediately brought a dispute against the United States for its taxation measures in the World Trade Organization (WTO). This is a constructive direction. Recently, Xi Jinping has also emphasized multilateralism many times, and China will become more open. Next, China will accelerate the opening up of the automobile and finance sectors. In addition, China may need to consider the external opening up of the Internet industry to allow more technology and capital to enter the Chinese market."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","The Chinese Internet is only the application of U.S. technology, and it does not have much original technology. If China accelerates the opening of the Internet market, even if in the initial stage the West occupies a little more in the Chinese Internet market, at least China will still have its own share and will develop its own original technology through real competition. If things continue to develop according to the current trend, the original technology in China’s Internet market will all be in the hands of the United States, and Internet development in China will be even more difficult in five or ten years. Protecting the Internet for so many years has not led to the emergence of original technology. In fact, the automobile industry’s development likewise illustrates this point. Protection is required in the beginning, but after a period of growth, it needs to be open and competitive, or else there will be no progress."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","More importantly, we must accelerate the construction of open platforms in China. For example, the “Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area” and “Hainan Free Trade Zone” should be key targets for construction. We absolutely need strong and in-depth reform policies concerning these internal platforms that are coordinated by the central government. The establishment of free trade zones with other countries and regions takes time and is not under China’s control. However, these internal free trade platforms are completely under China’s own control. We really must make these internal open platforms attractive to high-quality international capital."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","We must also accelerate internal reforms, especially in the area of intellectual property rights. The purpose of intellectual property rights protection is not only to deal with the pressure from the West, but more importantly to provide an effective mechanism for technological innovation for Chinese enterprises themselves. Without the protection of intellectual property rights, enterprises will not have motivation to innovate. At the same time, since China obtains technology from the international market, we must educate enterprises to accept international rules. The experience and lessons of the ZTE incident should be carefully summarized."
China’s Current Internal and External Risks,"Aisixiang , Zheng Yongnian","Jul 28, 2019","Generally speaking, although the Chinese market is extremely important to the United States, once a cold war begins, security considerations will dominate the United States’ relationship with China, and the United States will have to abandon the Chinese market for the sake of security. The United States can develop other markets, but if China is excluded from the world economic system dominated by the United States, or there is an economic and trade decoupling between China and the United States, this will be the beginning of the “Thucydides trap.”"

Chinese Diplomacy Forges Bravely Ahead in a Chaotic and Intertwined World,"Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Le Yucheng","Jan 18, 2022","The year 2021, which just passed, was a year full of crises and challenges. The COVID-19 epidemic has extended and resurged, changes unseen in a century have accelerated, peace and development have encountered “headwinds,” and great power relations, global governance, and regional hotspots have continued to be tense and turbulent. The political, economic, social, epidemic, and foreign relations of many countries have varying degrees of crises, and the whole world can be described as intertwined chaos and abounding disorder."
Chinese Diplomacy Forges Bravely Ahead in a Chaotic and Intertwined World,"Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Le Yucheng","Jan 18, 2022","Last year began with the “Great Occupation” of the U.S. Capitol Hill: Trump supporters violently stormed the U.S. Capitol, plunging American-style democracy and freedom into chaos. Then the whole world witnessed the “Great Defeat” of the U.S. military in Kabul: They left Afghanistan in turmoil and chaos, and the American-style “democratic transformation” failed again. At the end of the year and into the beginning of the new year, there was another “Great Loss of Control” of the epidemic in many countries: The number of newly confirmed cases per day in the United States peaked above 1.5 million, and the cumulative number of deaths reached 850,000, with major hospitals struggling to cope. The world economy is facing the most serious “Great Inflation” in 40 years: Prices in the United States, Europe, and other countries are “rising” everywhere, supply chains are blocked and disrupted, and normal people are complaining."
Chinese Diplomacy Forges Bravely Ahead in a Chaotic and Intertwined World,"Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Le Yucheng","Jan 18, 2022","These instances of world chaos are not only natural disasters, but also man-made disasters. In particular, some countries are “chaotically seeking treatments” and “treating internal diseases with external measures.” This has made the problems worse and exacerbated crises. In the end, these countries simply put the blame on others, going so far as to provoke a “new cold war”. This has disturbed world peace, and various risks and hidden dangers have risen significantly."
Chinese Diplomacy Forges Bravely Ahead in a Chaotic and Intertwined World,"Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Le Yucheng","Jan 18, 2022","Where is the way forward? I think the fundamental solution lies in the promotion of building a community with a shared future for mankind as advocated by President Xi Jinping. This major concept clearly answers the question of the times: “What’s wrong with the world and what should we do?” It has become a bright banner under which China can lead the trend of the times and the progress of human civilization. In his speech at the Davos Forum yesterday, President Xi Jinping pointed out that, to promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind, we must uphold dialog rather than confrontation, inclusion rather than exclusion, and oppose all forms of unilateralism and protectionism, and oppose all forms of hegemonism and power politics. This is a further enrichment and development of the concept of a community with a shared future for mankind and fully demonstrates President Xi Jinping’s intense responsibility for maintaining and promoting world peace and justice. The upcoming Beijing Winter Olympics will play the main theme of “Together to the Future” and will also compose a new movement for the building of a community with a shared future for mankind."

We solemnly celebrated the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, achieved the first centennial objective, and started a new journey to build a modernized socialist country in an all-round way and to march toward the second centennial objective. China’s economic development and epidemic prevention and control maintain its leading position in the world. In the first three quarters of 2021, GDP increased by 9.8% year-on-year, and the annual growth rate reached 8.1%. In 2021, China had two distinctive identifiers, which were common prosperity and open development."

Over the past 40 years, China has lifted more than 800 million people out of poverty, contributed more than 70% of global poverty reduction, and achieved the poverty reduction goal of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 10 years ahead of schedule. A few months ago, a reporter from the UK magazine The Economist visited Malipo County, Yunnan Province, which is designated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a region for assistance and support. The reporter published an article titled The confidence of China’s Communist Party is striking, reporting the story of Chinese diplomats who went to Malipo County to serve as deputy county magistrates and volunteer teachers and praising that “the Chinese Communist Party is serving a rising China” and “the concern of President Xi Jinping can be felt even in remote villages” [Translator’s note: These quotes are taken slightly out of context. The original article is more objective: “They want the masses to believe that, even in the remotest villages, their welfare is the concern of an all-knowing leader, Xi Jinping, served by officials striving to follow his stern but wise example.”] When he left his post at the end of last year, SCO Secretary-General Norov said excitedly that, in his three years in China he had the honor to witness the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China and the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. Having witnessed China’s poverty alleviation and anti-epidemic struggle, he was very moved, feeling admiration for and optimism about China from the bottom of his heart!"
Chinese Diplomacy Forges Bravely Ahead in a Chaotic and Intertwined World,"Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Le Yucheng","Jan 18, 2022","We continue to push forward reforms, expand opening up, and share development opportunities with all other countries around the world. 2021 marked the 20th anniversary of China’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). China’s opening up to the outside world is marching forward at a high level. In the first 11 months of 2021, China’s foreign trade increased by 22% year-on-year, and the scale of our annual foreign trade exceeded US$6 trillion. At last year’s Fourth China International Import Expo, nearly 3,000 companies from 127 countries and regions participated in the exhibition. The number of countries and companies exceeded the previous expo, and the value of intended transactions exceeded US$70 billion. 120,000 tins of Afghan pine nuts that had just arrived in China at that time were bought up in the “blink of an eye” during the live broadcast, and Russian manufacturers sold more than RMB4.6 million in chocolate and ice cream within seconds, once again proving the huge potential of the Chinese consumer market. China formally applied to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), showing China’s resolute determination to expand opening up and promote regional economic cooperation. With the entry into force of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) at the beginning of this year, China will open its door wider and wider, providing more opportunities for cooperation to the world."

Chinese Diplomacy Forges Bravely Ahead in a Chaotic and Intertwined World,"Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Le Yucheng","Jan 18, 2022","The first highlight moment was when President Xi Jinping proposed the “Global Development Initiative” at the 76th United Nations General Assembly. This is another important contribution China has made to promote stronger, greener, and healthier global development and accelerate the implementation of the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In addition, we have seen that President Xi Jinping has personally carried out a series of head-of-state diplomacy actions with nearly 120 video and phone calls with foreign leaders and heads of international organizations. He proposed a series of new concepts such as “a community of life for mankind and nature” and “a global community of development with a shared future,’ which have further contributed Chinese solutions and Chinese wisdom to the international community’s response to new problems and challenges."

The two heads of state issued a joint statement, jointly announcing the extension of the Treaty and giving it a new connotation for the times, while setting out on a new journey of friendship from generation to generation and mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries. Next month, President Putin will come to China to attend the “Winter Olympics” and “New Year’s Meeting” together with President Xi Jinping, further demonstrating to the world the strong momentum and vitality of high-level strategic cooperation between China and Russia."
Chinese Diplomacy Forges Bravely Ahead in a Chaotic and Intertwined World,"Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Le Yucheng","Jan 18, 2022","The third highlight moment was the first video meeting between Chinese and U.S. heads of state. This is a historic meeting that will steer Sino-US relations. The two heads of state had a candid and in-depth conversation on fundamental, overall, and strategic issues related to the development of Sino-US relations. President Xi Jinping put forward the three principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and mutually beneficial cooperation between China and the United States. Through this meeting and a series of confrontations from Anchorage, Tianjin, and Zurich to Rome, we have demonstrated our firm position as far as defending national interests and opposing hegemonic powers. We took the initiative to clarify the “Three Bottom Lines” (三条底线) and “Two Lists” (两份清单) to the U.S. side and loudly stated that “the old problem of the U.S. constantly interfering in other countries’ internal affairs needs to be changed.” We laid down rules to the Americans who are accustomed to being condescending and domineering, opened up a new paradigm of mutual respect and equal exchanges for Sino-US relations."
Chinese Diplomacy Forges Bravely Ahead in a Chaotic and Intertwined World,"Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Le Yucheng","Jan 18, 2022","The fourth highlight moment was the safe return to China of Ms. Meng Wanzhou. When, with deep emotion, Meng Wanzhou told the cameras at Shenzhen Airport that “If belief has color, it must be China red,” I think that the hearts of 1.4 billion Chinese people filled with emotion and pride. Over the past three years or so, President Xi Jinping was personally concerned about this situation and made unremitting efforts on the diplomatic front, while the people of the whole country showed strong solidarity. This “Return of the Late Boat” (晚舟归航, a poetic allusion to describe the long-delayed return of Meng Wanzhou) has become a vivid footnote of diplomacy for the people. As many netizens have said, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has entered into an irreversible historical process, putting an end to the era when intimidation, coercion, and sanctions were used to hinder the progress of the Chinese people!"
Chinese Diplomacy Forges Bravely Ahead in a Chaotic and Intertwined World,"Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Le Yucheng","Jan 18, 2022","As the fifth highlight moment, the China-Laos Railway opened to traffic. On December 5 last year, the China-Laos railway, which required 11 years of painstaking construction, was officially put into operation as the heads of state of the two countries jointly shouted the order to “start the train.” This railroad links China and Laos more closely, transforms Laos from a “land-locked country” to a “land-linked country,” increases domestic railways from 3 km to 430 km, and has brought broader space for development and wider hopes to the Lao people. It has also created another successful example of the joint construction of the “Belt and Road.” Concerning this point, Chairman Thongloun said excitedly at the opening ceremony that, “This is a proud moment, and the people of all ethnic groups in Laos can finally see their dreams come true.”"
Chinese Diplomacy Forges Bravely Ahead in a Chaotic and Intertwined World,"Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Le Yucheng","Jan 18, 2022","As the sixth highlight moment, China’s vaccine diplomacy assisted in the global fight against the epidemic. When the world was facing a serious “vaccine gap” and in many countries, especially developing countries, it was “hard to find a vaccine”, as a responsible major power, China was the first to commit to making the COVID-19 vaccine a global public good, the first to support intellectual property rights exemptions for vaccine research and development, and the first to cooperate in vaccine production with developing countries. Over the past year, China has provided more than 2 billion doses of vaccines to more than 120 countries and international organizations. Half of the vaccines used globally come from China. The leaders of more than 30 countries went to their airports to welcome the Chinese vaccine. Serbian President Vucic affectionately kissed the five-stared red flag when welcoming the Chinese vaccine. This was a touching scene and one that is now recorded in the history of Sino-Serbian friendship."
Chinese Diplomacy Forges Bravely Ahead in a Chaotic and Intertwined World,"Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Le Yucheng","Jan 18, 2022","Dear friends, looking back on the diplomatic work in the past year, I feel strong emotions. In today’s world that has too many frauds and too many poisonous lies about China, Chinese diplomacy has to expend a lot of energy “fighting fraud and providing antidotes to poison” in order to dispel falsehoods and reveal the truth."
Chinese Diplomacy Forges Bravely Ahead in a Chaotic and Intertwined World,"Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Le Yucheng","Jan 18, 2022","We can see some countries pulling together “small circles” and engaging in “group politics” under the banner of “multilateralism;” interfering in other countries’ internal affairs under the guise of human rights and engaging in unilateral sanctions and “long-arm jurisdiction” [长臂管辖]; and wearing a “democratic” vest and arriving as a teacher to swindle and cheat on all sides, concocting an ugly farce that pits “democracy” against “authority.” In our resolute opposition to these counterfeit and shoddy practices, we do not stand on ceremony. We firmly crack down on counterfeiting, so that everyone will shut down “fake human rights,” we will expose the true form of “fake democracy,” and strip off the disguise of “fake multilateralism” leaving it nowhere to hide. 1"
Chinese Diplomacy Forges Bravely Ahead in a Chaotic and Intertwined World,"Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Le Yucheng","Jan 18, 2022","Concerning the spread of political viruses in individual countries, all kinds of groundless accusations were leveled against China’s combating of the epidemic in the name of virus origin tracing, going so far as to concoct the bizarre theory that COVID-19 was leaked by a Chinese laboratory. On the one hand, we resolutely expose criticism and take countermeasures. On the one hand, we have actively cooperated with WHO in global origin tracing and twice invited WHO experts to China to carry out joint research on origin tracing. The experts said with satisfaction that, “I went wherever I wanted to go, and met everyone I wanted to meet.” They finally came to the scientific conclusion that “a laboratory leakage is extremely unlikely.” At the same time, more than 80 countries around the world sent letters to the WHO opposing the politicization of origin tracing, and more than 25 million Chinese netizens joined together to sign a petition for the WHO to investigate the Fort Detrick laboratory in the United States. This shows how unpopular it is to manipulate the politicization of the pandemic. On the other hand, in some countries, although they were notified immediately, still could not effectively control the raging spread of the pandemic, whether it be the Delta or Omicron variants. Facts have once again proved that the old problem of “prescribing medicine to others when one is sick” is a classic way to harm others without benefiting oneself, causing no end of harm."
Chinese Diplomacy Forges Bravely Ahead in a Chaotic and Intertwined World,"Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Le Yucheng","Jan 18, 2022","Another example is that some people in the United States are hyping up the “hard-line theory of China’s diplomacy”, and even label us as practicing “coercive diplomacy.” But just how does the United States treat China? The U.S. side positions China as its “most severe competitor” and will stop at nothing in suppressing China, wantonly interfering in China’s internal affairs, and infringing upon China’s core interests. Just recently, U.S. dignitaries continued to babble their slanders about Xinjiang “genocide” and the “lack of freedom” of Hong Kong’s Legislative Council elections. In addition, another batch of Chinese high-tech companies was sanctioned by the United States for no reason. The U.S. side has repeatedly stated that it wants to conduct “extreme competition” with China. But what is “extreme competition”? The report A Guide to Extreme Competition with China recently released by the RAND Corporation reveals the goal in a single sentence. To put it bluntly, it is to contain China’s by “doing everything possible,” including framing China, manipulating international institutions and rules, bringing together anti-China alliances, undermining the “Belt and Road,” alienating China in its relations with other countries, manipulating international public opinion, “decoupling” with China in key areas, and enhancing military deterrence against China. They can’t wait to put China to death. In the face of such “extreme competition,” do they still expect China to be indifferent, to allow our hands to be bound, and to go to our death like a lamb to the slaughter? That was the old dream of the empire from more than 100 years ago. It’s time to wake up."
Chinese Diplomacy Forges Bravely Ahead in a Chaotic and Intertwined World,"Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Le Yucheng","Jan 18, 2022","There is also a fallacy that accuses China of breaking international rules and trying to overthrow the current order and claims to maintain the so-called “rules-based international order.” However, they still do not seem to know what rules China has broken. And what rules are they maintaining? In fact, they are trying to override international law and impose “family law” [家法, the rules that govern a particular household] or the “rules of a secret society” on the international community. These people bypass the United Nations and international law on their own, do whatever they want, leave groups and break contracts, and engage in unilateral power plays. How are they qualified to talk about obeying rules and maintaining order? Last year, we solemnly celebrated the 50th anniversary of the restoration of the legitimate seat of the People’s Republic of China in the United Nations. Over the past 50 years, China has put the aims and principles of the UN Charter into practice with concrete actions, unswervingly upheld justice, defended justice, and opposed hegemony. We have shown the integrity and responsibility expected of a major country in the world and won the respect and praise of the international community."
Chinese Diplomacy Forges Bravely Ahead in a Chaotic and Intertwined World,"Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Le Yucheng","Jan 18, 2022","Dear friends, the world is undergoing major changes, and China has entered a new era, which requires new thinking and great wisdom. A year ago, I came here to discuss with you how to solve the problem of being scolded after we had solved the problem of being beaten into submission and faced with starvation. The “fighting fraud and providing antidotes to poison” I mentioned just now is aimed at this issue of “scolding.” This is not only a task on the diplomatic front, but also the common mission of the experts and scholars seated here. “Fighting fraud and providing antidotes to poison” requires courage, but even more, it requires thought and wisdom. In this regard, think tanks have unique advantages. Think tanks are not “cold storage.” They need to continuously output fresh and effective thoughts and ideas. They must be resourceful, offer advice and suggestions, and be fonts of wisdom and guiding lights. At the same time, think tanks cannot “shut up” themselves and hide away in ivory towers. Everyone still needs to get out of the office and go out into the world. You must have the courage to rectify the name of the Party, defend the country, and speak for the people. You must demonstrate the character and responsibility of Chinese scholars and make greater contributions to promoting communication and understanding between China and the world."

This initiative provides Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions for maintaining world peace and tranquility, and demonstrates China’s shouldering of its responsibilities as a major country. After this major initiative was proposed, it attracted a high level of attention in China and abroad. Some experts from the Research Center for Overall National Security Outlook and the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR) organized study seminars to earnestly grasp the initiative’s profound meaning. Through study, everyone came to believe that the proposal of the initiative is a major strategic conclusion made by President Xi Jinping having considered the changes in today’s world, the changes of the times, and the changes of history. It is another important innovation to the Party’s national security theory for the new era, the main content of which is the overall national security outlook. It is of pioneering significance and must be systematically and deeply understood, comprehensively implemented, and continuously enriched and developed."

The notions of security of different countries are becoming more complex. Faced with questions such as how to promote common security on the basis of realizing one’s own security, how to maintain one’s own security while maintaining common security, and how to balance the security of today and the security of tomorrow, there are varying ideas and fierce collisions, some of which even give rise to serious conflicts and turmoil. The notions are complex and the paths are diverse, posing real challenges to the security of all countries and world peace."
Deep Comprehension of the Global Security Initiative: Coordinating Our Own Security and Common Security,"China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR) , Chen Xiangyang , Dong Chunling , Han Liqun","May 9, 2022","In today’s world, the reasonable concerns of many countries regarding national sovereignty, territorial integrity and such, have not yet received a proper response. The basic pursuit of a development path and political system that suits one’s own characteristics is still not fully respected, and the basic requirements of equal rights such as the right to development, the right to have a voice, and the right to govern have not yet been effectively realized. In an era of turbulence and change, the exploration and pursuit by different countries of political systems, development paths, and social culture are at an unprecedentedly high level, which stands in sharp contrast to the brutal interference in other countries’ internal affairs, the wanton destruction of international norms, and selfish arrogance in the face of equal debates which we see from some countries."
Deep Comprehension of the Global Security Initiative: Coordinating Our Own Security and Common Security,"China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR) , Chen Xiangyang , Dong Chunling , Han Liqun","May 9, 2022","In today’s world, the international community is facing many major real contradictions and disputes. Issues such as competition and cooperation among major countries, the world economic recovery, the advancement of global governance, and industrial and scientific and technological progress are not just important elements of the changes unseen in a century, they also determine the direction of the changes unseen in a century, and they determine each country’s future development environment. To deal with these problems, major countries must shoulder their responsibilities, cooperate, and coordinate. However, the reality is that some countries have not put the aims and principles of the UN Charter first, but instead adhere to the Cold War mentality and unilateralism. They rope in allies and partners to engage in bloc politics and confrontations between camps, deceive and divide the world with pseudo-multilateralism, and seriously erode the cornerstone of world peace."
Deep Comprehension of the Global Security Initiative: Coordinating Our Own Security and Common Security,"China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR) , Chen Xiangyang , Dong Chunling , Han Liqun","May 9, 2022","In today’s world, some countries seek to achieve absolute security, base their own security on the insecurity of other countries, and disregard the reasonable security concerns of other countries. The security architecture has lost its balance and effectiveness, the reasonable security needs of the weaker party long go ignored, and long-accumulating security contradictions go unalleviated. This can very easily lead to the emergence of extreme behaviors and give rise to the expansion of contradictions and conflicts. This loss of balance and effectiveness in the security architecture is not only reflected in traditional military security and homeland security, but is also increasingly reflected in non-traditional security fields such as economics, science and technology, information, culture, and climate."
Deep Comprehension of the Global Security Initiative: Coordinating Our Own Security and Common Security,"China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR) , Chen Xiangyang , Dong Chunling , Han Liqun","May 9, 2022","In today’s world, there are still many countries that, in the face of contradictions and disputes, cast dialogue and peace negotiations to one side. They might threaten to use force themselves or fan the flames and encourage others to use force to solve problems, and when opportunities for dialogue and negotiation arise, they single-handedly obstruct and sabotage them. They might practice double standards on security issues and resort to means such as unilateral sanctions, “long-arm jurisdiction,” and “decoupling and cutting off supplies,” leading to the expansion of disputes and deepening rifts, and driving problems down the wrong path. These measures are causing serious and continuous damage to international peace and regional stability. They are the most direct obstacle to maintaining world peace."

The division of labor, cooperation, and interdependence established by economic globalization are being used by some countries as a weapon to exert leverage for their own interests and to attack other countries. The vigorous development and mutual integration brought about by the deep development of cultural diversity are being used by some countries as a tool to incite confrontation and create turmoil. The efficient communication and convenience of expression formed by the accelerated development of social informatization are being used by some countries as a channel for ideological infiltration, subversion, and destruction. Fields that could have promoted international cooperation such as climate, space, deep sea, polar regions, biology, and anti-terrorism are also being politicized and militarized at an accelerated pace."

Deep Comprehension of the Global Security Initiative: Coordinating Our Own Security and Common Security,"China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR) , Chen Xiangyang , Dong Chunling , Han Liqun","May 9, 2022","The Initiative has as its core essence the “Six Persistences” (六个坚持), forming a dialectical unity and complete system that is rich in meaning. It is not only a continuation and development of China’s fine traditional culture and wisdom and an integration and innovation of international security thinking with Chinese characteristics, but also the sublation and transcendence of Western security theory, a major contribution to international security theory, a strong response to the main security threats of today’s world, and an answer to the call of the times. It is a powerful theoretical weapon that we can use to maintain world peace and promote mutually beneficial cooperation."
Deep Comprehension of the Global Security Initiative: Coordinating Our Own Security and Common Security,"China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR) , Chen Xiangyang , Dong Chunling , Han Liqun","May 9, 2022","First, we must persist in the concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative, and sustainable security and jointly maintain world peace and security. Emphasizing a common, comprehensive, cooperative, and sustainable security outlook is an important connotation of our Party’s innovative theory of diplomacy in the new era as well as the most distinctive feature of the Global Security Initiative. President Xi Jinping pointed out that security is a precondition of development, and humankind is an indivisible security community. The current impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict has fully proven that no country can stand alone in the face of risks. Maintaining world peace and security is the common denominator of the interests of all humankind."
Deep Comprehension of the Global Security Initiative: Coordinating Our Own Security and Common Security,"China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR) , Chen Xiangyang , Dong Chunling , Han Liqun","May 9, 2022","Second, we must persist in respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, non-interference in other countries’ internal affairs, and respect for the development paths and social systems independently chosen by the people of each country. The national conditions, social conditions, and people’s conditions of the various regions of the world vary widely, and there is no universal development path. Forcing one’s will on others will inevitably hurt others and one’s self. Before now, the United States has forcibly attempted to transplant flowers and trees [移花接木, impose its own politics/culture on others], carrying out “democratic transformation” in countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan. As a result, they not only suffered disastrous defeats, but also brought catastrophic disasters to the local people. Reflecting on the past tells us that all the world’s countries, big or small, rich or poor, should fully respect the autonomy of other countries to prevent such tragedies from happening again."
Deep Comprehension of the Global Security Initiative: Coordinating Our Own Security and Common Security,"China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR) , Chen Xiangyang , Dong Chunling , Han Liqun","May 9, 2022","Third, we must persist in observing the aims and principles of the UN Charter, abandon the Cold War mentality, oppose unilateralism, and refrain from bloc politics and confrontations between camps. The success of one country does not mean that another country must fail. The world can fully accommodate the common growth and progress of all countries. All the world’s countries should take the road of unity and cooperation, rather than allowing individual countries to “set the rhythm” in the world from a so-called “position of strength.” All countries should shoulder their due responsibilities, abide by the aims and principles of the UN Charter, adhere to openness, inclusiveness, and mutually beneficial cooperation, practice genuine multilateralism, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for humankind."
Deep Comprehension of the Global Security Initiative: Coordinating Our Own Security and Common Security,"China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations (CICIR) , Chen Xiangyang , Dong Chunling , Han Liqun","May 9, 2022","Fourth, we must persist in taking seriously the reasonable security concerns of all countries and uphold the principle of the indivisibility of security. Humanity is an indivisible security community. The sovereignty, security, and development interests of any country should be protected, and the reasonable security concerns of any country should receive respect. In the recent Ukraine crisis, NATO, led by the United States, ignored the principle of the indivisibility of security and blindly pursued eastward expansion. This violated the pan-European security arrangement, and instead gave rise to the current security crisis in Europe. Military alliances and group confrontations will only jeopardize world peace. Only by taking seriously each other’s reasonable security concerns and building a balanced, effective, and sustainable security architecture can we achieve universal security and common security and find the path to a long-term solution to global security challenges."

War has never been the fundamental solution to resolve differences and disputes. Instead, it will only increase hatred and give rise to a greater crisis. The three India-Pakistan wars did not resolve the territorial disputes and religious conflicts between India and Pakistan. The five Middle East wars likewise failed to resolve the differences and conflicts between Arabs and Israel. The international community should recognize that dialogue and negotiation is the most effective way to resolve differences and should support all efforts that are conducive to the peaceful resolution of crises, using dialogue, negotiation, mediation, and other such means to resolve disputes, using the establishment of rules and mechanisms to manage and control situations, using the enhancement of mutual trust to ease tensions, and using political means to resolve crises."

Non-traditional security threats such as supply chain disruptions, food crises, energy shortages, terrorism, and climate change have become increasingly prominent. Countries around the world, especially the many countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, are facing graver security challenges. No country can stand on its own in the face of such threats, and no country should be left to face these challenges alone. All countries should strengthen coordination and share responsibilities, building a higher-standard global governance mechanism. As President Xi Jinping pointed out: “All countries are on board a great ship with a common destiny. To cross the stormy seas and sail to a bright tomorrow, we must act as if we are all in the same boat…”"

Deep Industrialization Is the Key to Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Xinhua News Agency , Yao Yang","Jul 14, 2016","Recently, Yao Yang, Dean of the National School of Development of Peking University, gave a speech entitled “China’s Prospects for Economic Growth and Current Economic Situation.” This article is adapted from the content of this speech."
Deep Industrialization Is the Key to Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Xinhua News Agency , Yao Yang","Jul 14, 2016","The 13th Five-Year Plan has set a very ambitious goal, calling for the economic growth rate to reach 6.5% for the next five years. Whether this goal can be achieved is highly related to whether China can cross over the middle-income trap. This article is divided into two sections. The first section looks at the commonalities of the countries or regions that have successfully crossed over the middle-income trap. The second section discusses China’s advantages and the problems we are facing."
Deep Industrialization Is the Key to Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Xinhua News Agency , Yao Yang","Jul 14, 2016",Successful Experience in Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap
Deep Industrialization Is the Key to Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Xinhua News Agency , Yao Yang","Jul 14, 2016","What helps countries cross over the middle-income stage and successfully reach high-income standards? As Tolstoy said in Anna Karenina, “All happy families are alike, but every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” Failure is actually very easy. Just make one mistake, and you may fail. High-income economies are all very similar. To become a high-income economy all aspects need to be in the best possible state."
Deep Industrialization Is the Key to Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Xinhua News Agency , Yao Yang","Jul 14, 2016",Economies that have successfully grown from middle-income to high-income have all done the following.
Deep Industrialization Is the Key to Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Xinhua News Agency , Yao Yang","Jul 14, 2016","First, high savings and high investment. At above 20%, the national savings rate in the United States is certainly not low. This savings rate mainly reflects corporate savings, while ordinary people save only a small amount, and the government has negative savings. High savings allows for high investment. When we talk about investment, it includes not only fixed assets, but also investment in scientific research. Engaging in scientific research means spending money, and China is willing to spend money in this regard. We have the Natural Science Foundation, which is already half the size of the U.S. National Science Foundation. At this rate of growth, it is estimated that it will surpass the United States within ten years."
Deep Industrialization Is the Key to Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Xinhua News Agency , Yao Yang","Jul 14, 2016","Second, in-depth industrialization. Successful economies have all implemented in-depth industrialization. This in-depth industrialization means that industrialization lasts for a long time. After a country enters the middle-income level, industrialization needs to continue for about 25 years. The changes in the proportions of the various industries are significant. The proportion of agriculture constantly declines, while the proportion of the service industry constantly increases. Only the manufacturing industry is distinct, as its proportion first rises and then falls. This is the case in the United States, South Korea, Taiwan, and all other successful economies. At the peak of industrialization in these economies, employment in manufacturing could account for more than 30% of total employment, and the added value of manufacturing could account for more than 40% of GDP. It is often said that the manufacturing industry represents too high a proportion of China’s economy, while the proportion of the service industry is too low. In fact, the data shows that the share of manufacturing in China is only slightly high, and the difference compared with those successful economies is not great. The statistics on China’s service industry are inaccurate – it is estimated that about 10% of the service industry is not included in the statistics. If we add this missing portion, the proportion of the service industry will be higher, and the proportion of the manufacturing industry will be reduced."
Deep Industrialization Is the Key to Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Xinhua News Agency , Yao Yang","Jul 14, 2016","Why is manufacturing important? The reasons include the following. First, manufacturing can create savings. Manufacturing has extremely high capital intensity, the return on capital is relatively high, and the savings rate of capital owners is high. Second, manufacturing improves the technological level of the entire country. Third, manufacturing supports the service industry. High value-added service industries such as finance and design must serve the manufacturing industry."
Deep Industrialization Is the Key to Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Xinhua News Agency , Yao Yang","Jul 14, 2016","Take India as an example. Even if the United States outsources all telephone and software jobs to India, it would only employ 5 million people in India, only 1% of India’s workforce of 500 million. Plus, it is not possible for the United States to outsource all service jobs to India. If India wants to catch up to China, it has no choice but to rely on manufacturing, but India is not doing this currently. This is a serious obstacle to the sustained growth of India’s economy."
Deep Industrialization Is the Key to Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Xinhua News Agency , Yao Yang","Jul 14, 2016","Brazil’s problem is premature de-industrialization. Starting in the 1980s, it abandoned the process of industrialization. Of course, this was tied to the sovereign debt crisis at that time. Since then, Brazil has suffered from a serious case of “Dutch disease.” What is “Dutch Disease?” During the oil crisis in the 1970s, the western world was very nervous. One after another, countries searched for oil, and oil fields were discovered in the North Sea. The large volume of oil exports from the Netherlands led to two results: First, the appreciation of the local currency made domestic goods extremely expensive. Second, the manufacturing industry completely disappeared. Brazil is in the same situation. This is a classic example of failure due to a lack of industrialization."
Deep Industrialization Is the Key to Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Xinhua News Agency , Yao Yang","Jul 14, 2016","The third is large-scale exports by the manufacturing industry. Successful economies are export-oriented, and manufacturing accounts for a relatively high share of exports. In the 1980s, China exported some resource products and agricultural products, but the technical content of exported products continued to improve. Currently, machinery products represent the largest share of export products. Many people say that our exports are low-tech and the profits go to others (给别人打工). In fact, our progress over the past three decades has been unparalleled. No country has done it better than China."
Deep Industrialization Is the Key to Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Xinhua News Agency , Yao Yang","Jul 14, 2016","The fourth is a high Human Development Index (HDI) value. In many indicators, successful economies are not very different from less successful economies. However, in education and health, they were superior to the failed economies from the very beginning. For example, Taiwan and South Korea popularized primary education very early on. China made many mistakes in the first 30 years after its founding. However, by comparing China and India in the 1970s and 1980s, we can see that China’s HDI value is much higher than India’s. This laid the foundation for China’s subsequent development."
Deep Industrialization Is the Key to Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Xinhua News Agency , Yao Yang","Jul 14, 2016","The fifth is a stable macro economy. An important reason why Latin America has not developed over the long term is inflation. Inflation in Brazil in the 1990s was 20% per month. In this sort of environment, no one can run a business. China has done very well in this regard. Inflation peaked at 24% in 1994 and has been on the decline since, never exceeding 10% after 1997."
Deep Industrialization Is the Key to Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Xinhua News Agency , Yao Yang","Jul 14, 2016","The sixth is a stable political environment. The failed economies often see government overthrown, while the successful ones have mostly stable political situations."
Deep Industrialization Is the Key to Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Xinhua News Agency , Yao Yang","Jul 14, 2016","The seventh is a lower degree of inequality. This is probably the area where China is lacking at present, while the successful economies have done this very well. For example, in Taiwan, the Gini coefficient is less than 0.37, and income distribution is very fair. The Gini coefficient for mainland China is high because of its huge size and the huge gap between urban and rural areas and different regions."

Deep Industrialization Is the Key to Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Xinhua News Agency , Yao Yang","Jul 14, 2016","China has two huge advantages: one is the advantage of a large country, and the other is the advantage of economic reform."
Deep Industrialization Is the Key to Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Xinhua News Agency , Yao Yang","Jul 14, 2016","The advantage of being a large country is first reflected in the scale of university enrollment. There are about 30 million students in Chinese universities, and more than 6 million students graduate every year. In addition, we have the largest number of scientific researchers in the world, and R&D investment already exceeds 2.1% of GDP. If this proportion increases by 0.1% every year, it will reach the 2.5% level of developed countries by 2020."
Deep Industrialization Is the Key to Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Xinhua News Agency , Yao Yang","Jul 14, 2016","The advantage of being a large country is also reflected in our huge space. China’s land area is larger than that of Europe, our population is 2.4x that of Europe, and our internal differences are also greater than those of Europe. The gap [in the level of development] within China is far greater than the gap between the coastal regions of China and developed countries. In the past, development mainly relied on the coastal regions, but in recent years, inland areas have begun to close the gap rapidly."
Deep Industrialization Is the Key to Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Xinhua News Agency , Yao Yang","Jul 14, 2016","The advantage of economic reform is also important. In this round of economic reform, financial reforms have been relatively thorough. By liberalizing shadow banking and other methods, the government has successfully realized the marketization of interest rates. Due to the risk-averse nature of banks, a financial system dominated by banks is not suitable for innovation. If we want to promote innovation through finance, we must turn to direct financing or capital markets. Through capital markets, the whole society bears the costs of innovation, while the innovators personally enjoy the benefits. China is currently working on developing capital markets."
Deep Industrialization Is the Key to Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Xinhua News Agency , Yao Yang","Jul 14, 2016","Next, let’s talk about the short-term problem China faces, the slowdown in economic growth. There are three reasons for this. One is that the world economy is adjusting. The second is that China’s economic structure is adjusting, that is, the peak moment in our industrialization process has already passed. The third is the influence of the economic cycle. Many people have been talking about structural issues, ignoring the economic cycle. In fact, China has experienced a total of four cycles of seven years each since the 1990s, and we are now at the bottom of the economic cycle."
Deep Industrialization Is the Key to Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Xinhua News Agency , Yao Yang","Jul 14, 2016","When analyzing these issues, we need to dispel some misunderstandings."
Deep Industrialization Is the Key to Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Xinhua News Agency , Yao Yang","Jul 14, 2016","The first misunderstanding is attributing the root cause of all problems to overcapacity. It seems that all we have to do is solve overcapacity and then everything will be perfect. In fact, the last round of economic growth was too good, and business expectations were too optimistic, so they increased investment. Eventually, overcapacity emerged in the cyclical adjustment of the economy. It is because of the recession, and especially the lack of demand, that there is excess capacity, not vice versa. Reducing production capacity is best performed by the market. Otherwise, all private enterprises will be affected, making capacity reduction a rent-seeking method for state-owned enterprises. Instead, the government should make full use of production capacity."
Deep Industrialization Is the Key to Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Xinhua News Agency , Yao Yang","Jul 14, 2016","The second misunderstanding is that, because China’s investment efficiency is declining rapidly, investment should be curtailed. Actually, the efficiency measured by economists is total factor productivity. This is a residual concept, and it is completely procyclical. During an economic upswing, production capacity is fully utilized and efficiency is high. However, during an economic downturn, the operating rate is very low, many workers do not have jobs, and efficiency is very low. This calculation method is not accurate."
Deep Industrialization Is the Key to Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Xinhua News Agency , Yao Yang","Jul 14, 2016","The return on investment (ROI) is indeed declining, but it is also reasonable. The ROI of capital depends on the marginal product. Before, there was a steady flow of cheap labor from the countryside to the cities and towns that could combine with capital, so the marginal product of capital did not decline. Now that the transfer of labor has basically ceased, the marginal return to capital has naturally declined. In addition, a lot of investment is in infrastructure construction. This kind of investment has a long period and is slow to produce results. In addition, many returns are social returns, which greatly improve the welfare of the people, but these are not necessarily economic returns."
Deep Industrialization Is the Key to Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Xinhua News Agency , Yao Yang","Jul 14, 2016","The third misunderstanding is that supply-side reforms and structural adjustments are the only options to improve the speed and quality of China’s economic growth. Actually, supply-side reforms involve implementing the communiqué of the Third Plenum of the 18th Party Congress, letting the market play a decisive role in resource allocation, and improving medium and long-term growth potential. Of course, in the short term, there are tasks to do, such as reducing capacity, destocking, and deleveraging, but in the long run, we must improve efficiency."
Deep Industrialization Is the Key to Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Xinhua News Agency , Yao Yang","Jul 14, 2016","These actions do not contradict demand management. We are now in a period of economic downturn, so the actual growth rate has not reached the potential growth level. The only way to increase the economic growth rate is through demand management. In terms of methods, demand management is nothing more than monetary policy and fiscal policy. Contrary to popular belief, fiscal spending has been declining since 2012, and the savings of government agencies and institutions have risen sharply. This is a major mistake in the context of an economic downturn."
Deep Industrialization Is the Key to Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Xinhua News Agency , Yao Yang","Jul 14, 2016","In summary, during the 13th Five-Year Plan period, the potential growth rate of the Chinese economy will remain above 6.5%. As the current growth rate is lower than this level, demand management must be carried out. The central government must instill confidence in enterprises so that entrepreneurs have good expectations. At the same time, the central government must increase the intensity of reform. If it can do this, China will be able to cross over the middle-income trap and achieve the dream of becoming a high-income country by the centennial of the country’s founding."

Since the beginning of the new century, with China’s accession to the WTO, China has begun to deeply participate in global development cooperation: From signing the United Nations Convention against Corruption to fully participating in international economic cooperation under the G20 framework, from proposing the Belt and Road Initiative to signing the Paris Agreement, and from proposing to build a community with a shared future for mankind to proposing the Global Development Initiatives, China has continued to accelerate its participation in global development cooperation and put the realization of sustainable development goals into practice. China is the first developing country to achieve the poverty reduction target of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals and has contributed more than 70% to global poverty reduction.

Second, while participating in global development cooperation, China has also demonstrated to the outside world our major achievements and valuable experience in advancing the modernization of national governance, providing Chinese solutions and propositions for global governance and jointly promoting global sustainable development."

One of the important reasons why Western countries are caught in a governance dilemma is the Western rejection of global development cooperation in concept and practice."
Deepening Global Development Cooperation and Improving Global Governance,"Party Construction , Xiong Hao","Jul 14, 2022","On the one hand, unlike China, which actively advocates and participates in global development cooperation, in recent years, Western unilateralism, protectionism, and egoism have been rampant, and anti-globalization voices have been rampant. On the other hand, contrary to China’s emphasis on “South-South cooperation” in international development cooperation, the international development cooperation exaggerated by the West adheres to a “Western-centric” stance, such that international cooperation is often accompanied by political and economic conditions, and the two sides of the cooperation lack equality and mutual benefit. Among them, it is particularly obvious that the West has built a relationship of hierarchy and subordination in cooperation with African countries. The real purpose of the West’s cooperation in this region is not to help them eliminate poverty and achieve sustainable economic and social development but to take control of Africa through cooperation and keep it attached to the asymmetric structure of dependence on the West."

We must implement the military education policy for the new era, putting into action the strategy to prioritize the development of universities and institutes of learning and deepening the reform of China’s military universities and institutes of learning. We must persist with cultivating and discovering talent during major missions and on the front lines.

Destruction and Reconstruction of Order in the Field: Reflections on Ukraine,"China Social Sciences Network , Yao Lu","Mar 1, 2022","After more than two years of havoc wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic, and following Sweden’s becoming the first country in the world to declare the end of the pandemic on February 9, many European countries have followed suit by lifting all pandemic restrictions. Just as humanity seemed to have just seen a glimmer of light in this fierce battle against COVID-19, another hot war came unexpectedly to the Eastern European hinterland. Early in the morning of February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin made an emergency televised address announcing the decision to launch a special military operation in the Donbas region. This special military operation then quickly turned into a full-scale war in Ukraine. In the blink of an eye, a Cold War shroud once again loomed over the European continent, and people even wondered aloud whether World War III was coming."
Destruction and Reconstruction of Order in the Field: Reflections on Ukraine,"China Social Sciences Network , Yao Lu","Mar 1, 2022","When there is an avalanche, no snowflake is innocent. The outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine was sudden, but as to its root cause, it is the inevitable consequence of the complex security game between the United States, Russia, and Ukraine after the Cold War. The “gray rhino” of war has entered the field, and the order within the field will be an overlapping of destruction and reconstruction."
Destruction and Reconstruction of Order in the Field: Reflections on Ukraine,"China Social Sciences Network , Yao Lu","Mar 1, 2022",The conflict in Ukraine is in essence the result of U.S.-Russian strategic interaction
Destruction and Reconstruction of Order in the Field: Reflections on Ukraine,"China Social Sciences Network , Yao Lu","Mar 1, 2022","In Mackinder’s [1904] geopolitical map, whoever controls the “heartland” of Eastern Europe will control the world. It was through its control of Eastern Europe that the former Soviet Union established a bipolar pattern to counterbalance the hegemonic United States. The collapse of the Soviet Union emptied the “heart” of the Eurasian organism, leaving a power vacuum at the center of the continent. The United States and Russia then started a struggle over this region, based on the establishment of their respective security borders, that has lasted thirty years. Russia needed a strategic buffer zone to reduce its security pressure from the west, while the United States incorporated the former Soviet sphere of influence into its own strategic space through successive eastern expansions of NATO, squeezing Russia’s strategic space step by step, and thus increasing Russia’s security anxiety."
Destruction and Reconstruction of Order in the Field: Reflections on Ukraine,"China Social Sciences Network , Yao Lu","Mar 1, 2022","In The Grand Chessboard, Zbigniew Brzezinski talks about how Russia “is more likely to become a problem, unless America fosters a setting that helps to convince the Russians that the best choice for their country is an increasingly organic connection with a transatlantic Europe.” In 1993, then-Russian President Boris Yeltsin publicly endorsed Poland’s membership in the transatlantic alliance, and thought that the process was in Russia’s national interest. Current Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed joining NATO three times. It is thus clear that post-Cold War Russia has tried to ease relations with the United States and Europe. However, the United States has never treated Russia as an equal partner, always seeing it as an adversary, and ignoring Russia’s legitimate security concerns. Russia’s assertiveness in Ukraine is a projection of Russia’s stress-induced reaction under the heavy pressure of NATO’s eastward expansion. If one says Russia today has become an enemy of the United States and Europe by going to war against Ukraine, then this enemy role is also a consequence of the United States’ failure in shaping its post-Cold War security strategy toward Russia."
Destruction and Reconstruction of Order in the Field: Reflections on Ukraine,"China Social Sciences Network , Yao Lu","Mar 1, 2022",Ukraine’s ingrained and intractable domestic contradictions are the root cause of the conflict
Destruction and Reconstruction of Order in the Field: Reflections on Ukraine,"China Social Sciences Network , Yao Lu","Mar 1, 2022","Ukraine’s own fragmentation and complexity have kept it mired in a muddle of interwoven internal and external problems, creating a diplomatic option dilemma, and eventually plunging it into the vortex of war. Many analysts believe that the U.S.-Russian rivalry dragged Ukraine into the war, but in essence, it was Ukraine’s own persistent ailments that created the battlefield for the great powers to fight over."
Destruction and Reconstruction of Order in the Field: Reflections on Ukraine,"China Social Sciences Network , Yao Lu","Mar 1, 2022","First, there is Ukraine’s special geopolitical environment. For Russia, Ukraine is the last defensive barrier in a “strategic buffer zone,” while for NATO it is the front line of offense for containing Russia. Although NATO has always been ambiguous about Ukraine’s demand to join NATO, for Russia, which is highly sensitive to security needs, the Ukraine issue is a bottom line and a core interest. Forces from the East and West have never abandoned the struggle over Ukraine."
Destruction and Reconstruction of Order in the Field: Reflections on Ukraine,"China Social Sciences Network , Yao Lu","Mar 1, 2022","Second, there is the fragmented nature of the Ukrainian state itself. Ukraine itself is the product of a collapsing empire, and its ethnic, religious, and linguistic intricacies have always put the country at risk of fragmentation. Ukrainians predominate in the western part of Ukraine, while the Donbas region in the east has a high proportion of Russians. The western part is Catholic, while the eastern part is Eastern Orthodox. Although Ukraine was once predominantly Russian-speaking, the “de-Russification” process begun by Ukraine after the Crimean Crisis in 2014 has further intensified the East-West conflict. The Donbas region in the east is pro-Russian, while the west, centered on the capital Kiev, is pro-Western."
Destruction and Reconstruction of Order in the Field: Reflections on Ukraine,"China Social Sciences Network , Yao Lu","Mar 1, 2022","Finally, there is the failure of Ukrainian state governance. Ukraine at the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union was called the “breadbasket of Europe,” and had the third largest nuclear arsenal in the world, but after 30 years of economic development and political transformation, it has almost become a “failed state,” on the verge of collapse. Zhang Hong, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, believes that the neoliberal Washington Consensus led to the emergence of oligarchy in Ukraine’s political transformation, which thus caused the form of the Ukrainian state to develop from collusion to capture, and finally to the brink of a “failed state.”"
Destruction and Reconstruction of Order in the Field: Reflections on Ukraine,"China Social Sciences Network , Yao Lu","Mar 1, 2022","To sum up, Ukraine was walking a tightrope due to the failure of state governance, the tearing of domestic fragmentation forces, and the disturbance of external forces. For Ukraine, it is safer to act as a “bridge between East and West” (Kissinger’s term) than to “choose sides.” However, both Yanukovych and Zelensky brought in external forces from one side to counter the other, ultimately eating away at their own country’s independence."
Destruction and Reconstruction of Order in the Field: Reflections on Ukraine,"China Social Sciences Network , Yao Lu","Mar 1, 2022",A New World?
Destruction and Reconstruction of Order in the Field: Reflections on Ukraine,"China Social Sciences Network , Yao Lu","Mar 1, 2022","The transformation of the international order, which has been explored continually in academic and policy circles in recent years, is based on three assumptions: first, the rapid development of China; second, the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic; and third, the disruption of the new technological revolution. While people are looking into the distance for the “metaverse,” international politics is regressing to the most primitive form—war of iron and blood. Once a war begins, it does not follow a fixed script. And though the outcome of the war remains unknown, the conflict in Ukraine is destined to have a profound impact on the transforming international order."
Destruction and Reconstruction of Order in the Field: Reflections on Ukraine,"China Social Sciences Network , Yao Lu","Mar 1, 2022","First, there is a return of great power politics, a failure of the international system, and a dramatic change of the post-Cold War international order. The collapse of the bipolar system led to the global domination of the United States, and although there are descriptions of the international landscape as “one superpower, many strong powers” or “an age of nonpolarity,” the units in the system have never formed a counterweight to hegemony, and “following the strong” has become the action logic of many countries. Today, Russia, one of the permanent five [members of the United Nations Security Council] and a nuclear power, is demonstrating to NATO, led by the United States, in the form of a war. This will have a transformative impact on the international order. In his book After Hegemony, Robert Keohane suggests that the decline of hegemony does not necessarily lead to war, as the inertia of the system still maintains the order of the system. However, the withdrawal under Trump and the failure of international organizations in the COVID-19 epidemic have put the non-neutral character of the international system in starker relief, and raised numerous questions about the existing system of international institutions. Now, NATO’s eastward expansion has brought about a hot war in Eastern Europe, and this war is also a major test for the international system with the United Nations at its core."
Destruction and Reconstruction of Order in the Field: Reflections on Ukraine,"China Social Sciences Network , Yao Lu","Mar 1, 2022","Second, the European geo-security landscape is facing a shake-up. On February 24, the day Russia launched its military special operation, German Chancellor Scholz said, “This is a terrible day for Ukraine and a dark day for Europe.” The United States, in conjunction with the EU, then imposed a series of harsh sanctions against Russia, including the announcement on February 27 that some Russian banks would be kicked out of SWIFT. Germany even changed its previous position of not providing weapons to the conflict zone and provided weapons to Ukraine. If the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact gave rise to the “NATO obsolescence theory” and Trump’s alienation of allies led to the “brain death of NATO,” then Biden’s diplomatic strategy to repair the alliance, coupled with the impact of the Ukraine conflict, could become a shot in the arm for NATO. On February 26, President Biden spoke publicly about the possibility of Finland and Sweden joining NATO. However, activating NATO would only worsen continental Europe’s security dilemma, bringing about an imbalance in the overall geo-security environment in Europe and a surge in the probability of a new Cold War."
Destruction and Reconstruction of Order in the Field: Reflections on Ukraine,"China Social Sciences Network , Yao Lu","Mar 1, 2022","Lastly, with U.S. global strategy facing “worries east and west,” China needs to take firm hold of the strategic moment and maintain strategic stability. In 2011, as the United States began to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan and Iraq, President Obama proposed an “eastward” turn in U.S. global strategy—a “pivot to Asia.” With the rapid development of China’s economy, China is facing increasingly strong strategic pressure from the United States. In 2017, Trump positioned China as a “strategic competitor” in the U.S. National Security Strategy and proposed an “Indo-Pacific Strategy” aimed at containing China. After the Biden administration took office, it intensified competition with China, and the Biden administration’s Indo-Pacific Strategy report was released on February 11. However, the outbreak of the conflict in Ukraine has required the United States to “look west” again and consider the geopolitical security challenges facing itself and its allies in Europe. A possible “east-west” shift in U.S. global strategy could bring dramatic changes to China’s strategic environment. China needs to maintain its strategic sobriety and strategic determination at all times, and resolutely follow the path of peaceful development in the midst of turmoil and crisis."

Development Orientation and Reflection of China’s International Relations Discipline,"Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) , Yan Xuetong","Oct 14, 2021","Since the reform and opening-up, China’s international relations research has gone through decades of development and has now entered a brand-new stage. Nowadays, the world is undergoing major changes unseen in a century, and relevant discipline development is constantly adapting to the great changes of the times. How to scientifically and accurately understand the development trend of China’s international relations discipline, promote the return of fundamental and theoretical research on international relations, and continuously enhance the scientific level of the discipline has become important problems that need to be solved urgently for colleagues in China’s international relations academic communities."
Development Orientation and Reflection of China’s International Relations Discipline,"Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) , Yan Xuetong","Oct 14, 2021",The Motive Force for the Development of International Relations Discipline
Development Orientation and Reflection of China’s International Relations Discipline,"Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) , Yan Xuetong","Oct 14, 2021","There are two major driving forces for the development of disciplines. The first is the natural growth of knowledge, which means the increase of knowledge would continuously form new disciplines. For example, classical physics was first developed, then relativistic astrophysics and quantum mechanics. With the acquisition and increase of new knowledge, new disciplines are born. The path of knowledge accumulation can be divided into two patterns: First, with continuous development, disciplines are subdivided into many different branches. For example, after physics and chemistry become two disciplines, chemistry is divided into polymer chemistry, organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, and so on. The other pattern is interdisciplinary integration into a new discipline. For example, physics and chemistry are integrated into the physicochemical subject. The second is to promote the development of new disciplines under human guidance, which can also be divided into two types. One is guided by the government. For example, in the first decade of the 21st century, China’s Marxist theory was designated (by the government) as a first-level discipline, no longer being a second-level discipline under the first-level discipline of political science. The other is guided by the academic community. For example, to promote international and regional studies in the New Era, a group of academic pacemakers and young or middle-aged “backbone teachers” are working hard to make it a [government-designated] first-level discipline."
Development Orientation and Reflection of China’s International Relations Discipline,"Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) , Yan Xuetong","Oct 14, 2021","The development of international relations discipline is the result of these two driving forces. In addition, the development of a discipline is inseparable from the promotion of scientific methods. Historical experience shows that only by adhering to scientific methods can we defeat regression in the real world and promote academic progress. At present, mankind has entered an era of “uneasy peace”, that is, a world without war but full of fear because people have a new understanding of the uncertainty of international politics. In this context, big data provides more possibilities for exploring new research paths and methods for international relations research. The concept of the big data research method is that we don’t need to know what the causal relationship is, and we don’t need to pay attention to how uncertain things are, but exhaust all the data to reach the conclusion directly. Therefore, in terms of scientific methods, it is appropriate to take an open mind to it rather than deny it. International issues on different levels can be studied by different methods, and what is important is to improve the reliability of research methods."
Development Orientation and Reflection of China’s International Relations Discipline,"Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) , Yan Xuetong","Oct 14, 2021",Four Judgments on the Development Trend of China’s International Relations Discipline
Development Orientation and Reflection of China’s International Relations Discipline,"Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) , Yan Xuetong","Oct 14, 2021",The development of China’s international relations discipline has shown the following four trends:
Development Orientation and Reflection of China’s International Relations Discipline,"Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) , Yan Xuetong","Oct 14, 2021","First, basic and theoretical research is being weakened. Among the keynote discussion topics of the 14th Annual Meeting of the Chinese Community of Political Science and International Studies in 2021, there are fewer discussion topics on international relations theories, international relations database construction, and basic theories. As far as the publication of academic journals is concerned, articles published in academic journals on international relations have increased, but intellectual innovation has decreased. The main reason is that there are more policy-oriented studies, and the innovation by policy-oriented articles lies not in knowledge-based innovation, but in the practicality of solving specific problems. However, basic research can often explore the mechanism and principle behind issues and can form a profound theoretical exposition of research problems, thus having a great impact on disciplines. When a hot international issue or an urgent problem is solved, those policy suggestions become “antiques”. If there are more scholars in policy studies, there will be fewer scholars creating academic knowledge, which leads to a decrease in the amount of knowledge created."
Development Orientation and Reflection of China’s International Relations Discipline,"Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) , Yan Xuetong","Oct 14, 2021","Second, the return of the tendency to oppose using scientific methods to study international relations. Whether the scientific method is based on classical physics, quantum mechanics, big data, or other scientific knowledge, using them to study international relations can improve the scientific level of this discipline. The current trend against scientific research methods has picked up. Some academic journals at leading universities on international relations have published successive articles criticizing the scientific approach to the study of international relations, saying that the scientific approach has multiple flaws. The scientific approach certainly has flaws, because every research method has flaws. However, compared with traditional research approaches, the scientific approach has two advantages. One is that it has fewer flaws than the former, and the other is that it can be improved continuously. The scientific approach can avoid many inherent flaws of traditional approaches, mainly the issue of unreliability. In fact, to oppose the scientific methods of studying international relations is to oppose the improvement of research methods and the scientification of international relations research."
Development Orientation and Reflection of China’s International Relations Discipline,"Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) , Yan Xuetong","Oct 14, 2021","Third, the admissions threshold is decreasing, the level of professional education declining, and the market for errors is increasing. For example, the admissions threshold to international relations majors for undergraduates is lowering. International relations has low entry scores compared with other majors. Also, in the postgraduate entrance examinations, the specialization of examination questions has decreased, with less examination of the fundamentals of the discipline. International relations teachers are emphasizing professionalism less and expressing their views more in other areas. All of the above practices are lowering the bar for international relations majors."
Development Orientation and Reflection of China’s International Relations Discipline,"Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) , Yan Xuetong","Oct 14, 2021","Fourth, judging academic achievements by standards in the society rather than academic standards. Online articles that are read over 100,000 times on WeChat have become equivalent to Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) articles, which is equaling online celebrity to the level of academic status. Online celebrity is the result of the market of public opinion with divergent thinking, and many related articles are imaginary without an objective basis. In fact, innovation is based on the formation of correctly divergent and convergent thinking. Divergent thinking can help scholars transcend the constraints of existing knowledge and form infinite answers or opinions, but it depends on convergent thinking to eliminate all unreasonable answers and scientifically test several answers that have not been excluded. Replacing academic standards with influence in the society leads to regarding the divergent thinking within the current “online celebrity” articles as innovation, which is a subjective imagination."
Development Orientation and Reflection of China’s International Relations Discipline,"Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) , Yan Xuetong","Oct 14, 2021",Four Suggestions on China’s International Relations Studies
Development Orientation and Reflection of China’s International Relations Discipline,"Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) , Yan Xuetong","Oct 14, 2021","China’s international relations studies have gone through decades of development. In view of its existing problems, the following four suggestions are put forward."
Development Orientation and Reflection of China’s International Relations Discipline,"Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) , Yan Xuetong","Oct 14, 2021","First, more research on academic subjects, fewer policy recommendations. Foreign policy is formulated by the state’s decision-makers. Ordinary people don’t understand the specific landscape of diplomacy, so their policy suggestions are unlikely to be operatable. Scholars should devote their energies to academic studies, aka facts and reasoning, which have strong vitality; the outcomes of policy research are only applied to specific issues, which is short-lived. In order to gain strong academic vitality and lay a solid foundation for policymaking, it is suggested that we should do more basic academic research and make fewer policy suggestions."
Development Orientation and Reflection of China’s International Relations Discipline,"Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) , Yan Xuetong","Oct 14, 2021","Second, learn more about what you cannot do, and object less to what you don’t understand. The premise of academic opposition is to knowledge on the subject to which you object. For example, the premise of objections to the quantitative analysis method should have been that you have mastered this method. Nowadays, some people are critical of academic achievements they cannot understand. This practice of opposing what you don’t understand is a symptom of ignorance. There are two possibilities if you can’t understand something: one is that the person who wrote it was wrong; the other is that readers lack the professional knowledge and ability to understand, and the latter happens frequently. Researchers need to first learn what they can’t do and what they don’t understand, so as to increase their existing knowledge."
Development Orientation and Reflection of China’s International Relations Discipline,"Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) , Yan Xuetong","Oct 14, 2021","Third, pursue more professional studies and indulge less in commentaries on current affairs. There is a division of labor in society; commentaries on current events are mainly the work of journalists, and the work of scholars is mainly to study academic issues, write academic articles, write books, write textbooks, and build databases. At present, in the international relations community, there are few scholars who build databases and few teachers who write textbooks. International relations scholars should devote more energy and time to their own work."
Development Orientation and Reflection of China’s International Relations Discipline,"Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) , Yan Xuetong","Oct 14, 2021","Fourth, uphold academic standards more and care less about online feedback. Measuring academic development by online feedback has a certain reference value, but it cannot be taken as an absolute or even the main standard. Academic research needs to have its own professional standards in evaluations, and by testing our results more through academic standards, the academic level will continue to improve."

"Disorderly Expansion of Capital: Performance, Risks, Root Causes, and Responses","China Development Observation , Jiang Zhaohui , Zheng Liansheng","Mar 25, 2022","Capital is one of the basic factors of production. Narrow capital mainly refers to equity capital, while broad capital includes not only equity capital but also debt capital.

Product chain expansion mainly focuses on integrating upstream and downstream resources of the product chain to form economies of scale and scope. Market-based expansion aims to acquire a larger market share, focusing on horizontal mergers and acquisitions and economies of scale. Resource-based expansion aims to occupy various resources, such as technology, markets, and product chains, and pays more attention to the construction of ecosystems. Permit-based expansion uses institutional permits, business permits, or franchising for the purpose of capital expansion."
"Disorderly Expansion of Capital: Performance, Risks, Root Causes, and Responses","China Development Observation , Jiang Zhaohui , Zheng Liansheng","Mar 25, 2022","An understanding of capital expansion in terms of industries offers more direct policy value. There are three main modes of capital expansion: Expansion within the industry, expansion into related industries, and expansion into unrelated industries. First, an expansion within an industry includes horizontal expansion and vertical expansion. Horizontal expansion is mainly used to expand the scale of the industry, which is mainly manifested as “copying” the mature production, operation, or business model of an enterprise and expanding its production capacity, output, or service scope. For example, an automobile manufacturing company acquires or builds more manufacturing plants to produce multiple types of products. Vertical expansion is the expansion up or down along the product chain, the purpose of which is to internalize external costs, reduce costs, and improve efficiency. For example, car manufacturers may invest in steel, rubber, and other industries in the upstream of the product chain and invest in sales enterprises in the downstream of the product chain."
"Disorderly Expansion of Capital: Performance, Risks, Root Causes, and Responses","China Development Observation , Jiang Zhaohui , Zheng Liansheng","Mar 25, 2022","Second, the expansion into related industries refers to an expansion into other industries related to the development of a given industry. For example, in order to achieve diversified financing purposes, real estate companies invest, participate in, or even control commercial banks, industrial funds, or other financial institutions. Automobile manufacturers set up consumer finance companies for sales and service facilitation. Technology companies expand into fintech to improve their technological application capabilities and develop diversified financial businesses or, alternatively, traditional financial companies invest in setting up fintech companies or establishing e-commerce platforms to cope with the pressure of digital transformation."
"Disorderly Expansion of Capital: Performance, Risks, Root Causes, and Responses","China Development Observation , Jiang Zhaohui , Zheng Liansheng","Mar 25, 2022","Third, the expansion into unrelated industries is mainly into areas that are not clearly related to a given industry. For example, network service providers and real estate companies investing in automobile manufacturing; air-conditioning manufacturers investing in mobile phone manufacturing; home appliance companies investing in pharmaceutical and biological industries; computer companies investing in transportation services. This type of expansion is all about investing in other areas that are not part of a given industry. There are three potential reasons for large corporations to diversify across borders. The first is diversification and expansion based on development and transformation. When this occurs, corporations are very optimistic about the development prospects of hot industries and make cross-border investments for higher profits or for business transformation. The second is for a diversified expansion based on corporate valuation or financing convenience. Hot industries may be very attractive to other investors, and the market valuation premium can be used to increase the overall valuation of the company so as to improve its balance sheet and ease pressure on capital financing. The third is diversification and expansion based on the transfer of funds. When it is difficult to continue financing in an industry or for a project, it is relatively easy to obtain investment through hot projects, funding for which can then be transferred to the original industry or other unrelated fields."

However, when capital expansion deviates from national policy goals and from basic value principles, arbitrarily raises the “threshold” of competition, and is used to conduct regulatory evasion or arbitrage, it gradually devolves into disorderly capital expansion. The disorderly performance of resource-based and license-based capital expansion has become more prominent, while the disorderly expansion of capital in unrelated industries has grown quite serious."
"Disorderly Expansion of Capital: Performance, Risks, Root Causes, and Responses","China Development Observation , Jiang Zhaohui , Zheng Liansheng","Mar 25, 2022","The disorderly expansion of domestic capital is universal, to a certain extent, and it is more serious in the integration of industry and finance, in real estate, and in the financial sector. At the industrial level, the disorderly expansion of domestic capital runs through a larger part of the industry, gradually forming alienated industrial capital, real estate capital, and financial capital. The use of capital factors and capital expansion permeate all areas of economic development, while disorderly expansion is more prominent in asset management, real estate, local financing, emerging technologies, and other fields. In the financial sector, some real enterprises and financial institutions, in the name of diversified expansion or comprehensive operation, control or hold various types of financial permits, substantially carry out mixed operations, and even evade supervision with the support of capital operations and conduct regulatory arbitrage to form alienated financial capital."
"Disorderly Expansion of Capital: Performance, Risks, Root Causes, and Responses","China Development Observation , Jiang Zhaohui , Zheng Liansheng","Mar 25, 2022","The forms of disorderly expansion of domestic capital is mainly reflected in five aspects. One is the issue of capital raising. Typical alienation methods are false investments, capital evasion, and illegal investments. The second is the expansion of capital with high leverage. Whether it is debt financing or equity financing, problems tend to arise, such as excessive debt or share transfers at high premiums. The third is the complex related-party transactions of capital. Some capitals take advantage of the loopholes in the supervision of separate industries and use a “sausage” or “nesting doll” approach to conduct multi-level, multi-subject, and cross-domain capital transactions. The fourth is to link to foreign capital. With the help of the so-called international influence and market credibility of some forms of foreign capital, capital expansion is carried out in various fields. Of course, some of this so-called foreign capital amounts to the alienation of domestic capital. Fifth is the disorderly exit of capital. Various trading markets and means are used to conduct transactions in a manner that seriously deviates from the fair value of the market. It is worth noting that the disorderly expansion of capital is prominent in large and medium-sized private enterprises though there are also many state-owned enterprises and financial institutions involved."

This once triggered a major risk to equity pledge financing in China’s capital market. At the same time, excessive capital expansion may deviate from the main business of an enterprise."

During the process of excessive capital concentration and disorderly expansion, it is easy to form a dominant market entity in a given market which may even grow to become a monopoly. Taking a large internet platform as an example, the process of capital expansion may produce great network effects, extreme economies of scale, and the phenomenon of “winner takes all.” When the disorderly expansion of capital builds an ecosystem that is endogenously beneficial, capital owners will infringe on consumers’ rights and interests by means of differentiated markets, discriminatory pricing, and choice restrictions. Due to the disorderly expansion of capital and an eagerness to exit to benefit, some market players choose the “shortcut” of listing, to the point where financial fraud grows serious, to the point where some Chinese concept stocks have been considered “junk stocks” by foreign investors."

"Disorderly Expansion of Capital: Performance, Risks, Root Causes, and Responses","China Development Observation , Jiang Zhaohui , Zheng Liansheng","Mar 25, 2022","First, the function of capital elements in serving the development of the real economy becomes alienated. The scale of financial capital for short-term arbitrage continues to expand, idling arbitrage becomes more and more serious, and the function of capital elements to serve the real economy weakens. In the past decade, China’s incremental capital-to-output ratio has risen rapidly from around 3.5 to nearly 7, that is, only 1 unit of output is produced for 7 units of capital input; capital efficiency is extremely low. Secondly, the strategic orientation of capital factors to serve the country’s development is not sufficiently clear. The problems of capital “grouping,” “gathering,” and “taking over the baton” have grown more serious, making it difficult to effectively allocate capital in key areas and major projects in the national development strategy. Finally, the disorderly expansion of capital will hinder the development of innovation. Capital expansion substantially raises the entry barriers for potential market competitors, and innovative or disruptive technologies may be “hidden.”"
"Disorderly Expansion of Capital: Performance, Risks, Root Causes, and Responses","China Development Observation , Jiang Zhaohui , Zheng Liansheng","Mar 25, 2022",An Analysis of the Root Cause of the Disorderly Expansion of Capital in China
"Disorderly Expansion of Capital: Performance, Risks, Root Causes, and Responses","China Development Observation , Jiang Zhaohui , Zheng Liansheng","Mar 25, 2022","As a production factor, the internal driving force of the disorderly expansion of capital mainly comes from the following aspects: The first is the inherent profit-seeking nature of capital operation. Capital raising, utilization, and exit operations are mainly measured by returns on capital, which makes capital operations inherently profit-seeking. This is especially true when profit is the only measure, such that capital operations and capital expansions will more likely fall into disorder. The second is that capital expansion enhances competitiveness. Weakening potential competition threats through capital operations is an important market behavior in the development of domestic and foreign market economies. In particular, industrial capital can establish an integrated product chain through vertical capital operations and expand market share through horizontal capital expansion. The third is to expand the “inventory” of interests through capital expansion. In the expansion of financial capital or monopoly capital, large capital owners or financial intermediaries mainly aim to expand their own permits, operations, and business scope so as to build an ecosystem that integrates diversified products and services and has self-circulating functions. The fourth is an attempt to circumvent regulation. Taking a bank’s on-balance sheet funds as an example, funds are constrained by the diversification of deposit reserves, capital adequacy ratios, and macroeconomic policies. However, turning such funds into off-balance sheet operations and capital operations in specific areas may present the bank with relatively low regulatory requirements, giving financial institutions greater incentives to participate in various “nested” and “roundabout” capital operations. Regulation-avoidant capital expansion is a major disruption to fair competition, orderly markets, and the regulatory system."
"Disorderly Expansion of Capital: Performance, Risks, Root Causes, and Responses","China Development Observation , Jiang Zhaohui , Zheng Liansheng","Mar 25, 2022","The disorderly expansion of capital has specific institutional and mechanism roots. First, there is an institutional mismatch between separate supervision and mixed operations, which enables capital owners and financial intermediaries to take advantage of the lack of supervision or the ambiguity of supervision by separate supervisors to conduct regulatory evasion and regulatory arbitrage. Secondly, there is a functional trade-off between financial development and financial supervision, which makes some financial supervisors place financial development above financial supervision. The level of investment in financial supervision resources is relatively insufficient, and the effectiveness of financial supervision must be further improved. Some regulators have adopted an attitude of “ignoring” the disorderly expansion of capital or even becoming a “catalyst” thereof. Thirdly, there are distorted interests of high financial inhibition and high returns on capital patterns. Important achievements have been made in the market-oriented reform of the financial system in the past, but the domestic financial system as a whole is still under severe financial repression. Various types of capital compete to enter the financial system to obtain financial permits and business licenses, and the disorderly expansion of financial capital has an inherent institutional driving force. Finally, capital supervision lacks a long-term mechanism. “As soon as it is released, it will be chaotic, and if it is managed, it will die” is a major problem in the supervision of China’s economic and financial sectors. Taking the recent regulatory policies against monopolies and unfair competition and preventing the disorderly expansion of capital as an example, before the fourth quarter of 2020, the regulatory authorities rarely took targeted regulatory measures. Afterward, many authorities intensively introduced many policies or measures, exhibiting “temporary” and “emergency” regulatory characteristics."

Incorporate capital operations and capital expansion into the scope of supervision, avoid insufficient supervision, gaps, and even loopholes, and support institutional supervision.

Disputes About the “Indo-Pacific” Regional Security Order and China’s Vision of Regional Order,"Foreign Affairs Review , Ge Tengfei","May 3, 2021","Represented by China and India, the economic power of emerging economies in Asia has risen rapidly, so that the vast area from the Pacific Ocean to the Indian Ocean presents a clear upward trend in geopolitico-economics (地缘政治经济). This has been accompanied by the emergence of the “Indo-Pacific” concept, and the “Indo-Pacific” region has thus become an emerging geopolitical region that is the subject of intense debates in international politics academic circles. Some countries in the Asia-Pacific region as well as the United States and Europe have launched successive Indo-Pacific strategies, which not only reflects the keen interest of the international community in the Indo-Pacific region, but also shows that the development of the Indo-Pacific region certainly has significant international political, economic, and security implications. In the words of an Australian scholar, “the traditional Asia-Pacific era has come to an end, and the world has entered the Indo-Pacific era.” 1 However, as “Indo-Pacific” is a relatively new geopolitical construction in international politics, the reason why it was able to quickly enter the strategic agenda of major countries around the world is the fact that, to a large extent, it embodies the geopolitical intentions and practices of the United States and reflects the fierce strategic competition and confrontation of the United States with China. It is precisely the negative impact of this confrontational strategic agenda that initially led to the formation of the “Indo-Pacific” concept and faced the so-called “Indo-Pacific” region with the basic need to establish a peaceful and stable regional order. Without a peaceful and stable regional order, a shadow will inevitably be cast over the development prospects of this region. Therefore, this has given discussions of the issue of security and order in the “Indo-Pacific” region a particular urgency."

Disputes About the “Indo-Pacific” Regional Security Order and China’s Vision of Regional Order,"Foreign Affairs Review , Ge Tengfei","May 3, 2021","There are different opinions concerning research on the regional security order. These mainly include the ideas of “porous regional orders” proposed by Peter Kazanstein, the “regional security complexes (RSCs)” proposed by Barry Buzan, and the “regional security communities” explained by Amitav Acharya using ASEAN as an example. The “porous regional order” described by Kazanstein refers to the regional order in Europe and Asia established under the influence of the “imperial power” of the United States and led by regional central countries. 2 Obviously, from a realist perspective, a regional order is defined as a political and economic process associated with great power relations or hegemony. This sort of power politics path must be strongly rejected in the construction of the security order in the Indo-Pacific region because the current U.S. thinking on strategic competition with China has put the region in a predicament of extreme insecurity. Acharya’s “regional security community” is established based on the most fundamental, consistent, and long-term convergence of interests among actors in order to avoid war. This is what Karl Deutsch calls a “non-war community.” 3 Obviously, this is not in line with the reality of the construction of the Indo-Pacific regional security order. After all, the Indo-Pacific regional security order is far from reaching the point where all countries in the region jointly renounce armed confrontation. Buzan’s theory of RSCs holds up the regional level as the appropriate level for conducting many applied security analyses. It aims to provide a simplified analytical framework for predicting and interpreting developments within a region. An RSC refers to such a regional level—countries or other units are closely linked to each other to the extent that their security cannot be considered separately from each other. Geographical boundaries, anarchic structures, polarities (material structures), and friendly-hostile patterns (social structures) are the four major variables that define the structure of RSCs. 4 An RSC is a relatively distinguishable, operable, inclusive, and abstract concept. It provides, in the words of Buzan and Ole Wæver, “a framework that is sufficiently open and abstract that it allows for far-reaching differentiation to develop among regions, while maintaining a general set of categories with which to describe this.” 5 This is what makes it a convenient analytical framework that we can use to analyze the security order in the Indo-Pacific region. Interestingly, in a 2003 work in which Buzan and Wæver proposed the RSC theory, they also proposed an “Asian supercomplex” encompassing East Asia, South Asia, and Australia. This was a sort of anticipation of today’s “Indo-Pacific” geopolitical region. 6"
Disputes About the “Indo-Pacific” Regional Security Order and China’s Vision of Regional Order,"Foreign Affairs Review , Ge Tengfei","May 3, 2021","The RSC theory provides an analytical framework and predicts the emergence of an Asian supercomplex similar to the Indo-Pacific geographic concept. However, how the internal material power relations of such an Asian supercomplex will evolve and how its social relations will develop are our real concerns. The RSC theory provides an open analytical framework and, in a general sense, focuses on the possibility of developing a “regional security continuum” in a general sense. This means that, as the internal structure of a security complex changes, its social structure can evolve from a conflict format to a security community through security mechanisms. 7 However, out of a certain Western-centrism, the ideological bias of the so-called “democratic peace theory,” an infatuation with U.S. hegemony, and a suspicion and fear of different civilizations and the rise of China, Buzan and Wæver negatively hold that the potential social structures of the Asian supercomplex can be reduced to an extremely narrow range, saying “The East Asian RSC seems almost certain to end up either towards the milder end of the conflict formation scenario or somewhere near the weak end of the regional security regime.” They see China as a “belligerent” and the United States as a proponent of the balance of power that is reluctant to get involved in Asia. 8 In fact, the current geopolitical confrontation in the Indo-Pacific region stems from the realist power politics manipulation by the United States in this region as foreseen or hoped for by Buzan and Wæver. The ideological biases of the authors and their fascination with U.S. hegemony obviously limit the theory’s explanatory power for the current Indo-Pacific regional security order—after all, the United States, a force from outside the region, cannot function as an endogenous driving force for regional security construction. For this reason, the United States cannot provide a benign and rational solution to solve the dilemmas of this RSC."
Disputes About the “Indo-Pacific” Regional Security Order and China’s Vision of Regional Order,"Foreign Affairs Review , Ge Tengfei","May 3, 2021","However, the pursuit of a path out of the security confrontation predicament is the primary concern of scholars of this region in their research on the regional order, and it is also the theoretical and practical aim of this paper. As the Chinese scholar Zheng Xianwu said, if the East Asia region does not want to carry on the growth and spread of hostility and other factors of insecurity that lead to turbulent situations such as crises and conflicts, there is only one choice. This is to create a stable and lasting regional security order by actively developing security regionalism (安全区域主义) on the basis of existing security regionalization (安全区域化). 9 In view of the fact that, in the current Indo-Pacific region, it is difficult to say that there is some dominant concept of security regionalism with the objective of a friendly regional security order. Moreover, taking a long view, the Indo-Pacific region has no clear prospect of developing a regional security mechanism, to say nothing of the possibility of forming some kind of Indo-Pacific regional security community. Based on this situation, this paper invokes another more fundamental concept—regionness (地区性), to provide the possibility of theoretical discussion about the construction of a security order in the Indo-Pacific region. The concept of “regionness” was proposed by Swedish scholars Björn Hettne and Fredrik Söderbaum and others, and Chinese scholars Pang Zhongying discussed the issue of regionness construction in East Asia from the three dimensions of politics, economy, and culture. Qin Yaqing, Geng Xiefeng, Zheng Xianwu, and others have also given theoretical explanations of Asian regionness issues such as the East Asian model, Asian concepts, and Asian methods. 10"
Disputes About the “Indo-Pacific” Regional Security Order and China’s Vision of Regional Order,"Foreign Affairs Review , Ge Tengfei","May 3, 2021","Regionness is a concept or idea used to express the degree and level of regionalization development and emphasizes the constructedness of regions. It emphasizes that regions are always in the process of construction, and the enhancement of regionness promotes an increased level of regionalization, which indicates better chances for success in the process of regional construction. The weakening of regionness leads to a decline in the level of regionalization, which means that the process of regional construction has failed or is moving towards failure. Thus, regionness connotes a gradual and dynamic construction process. 11 It can be said that regionness, used at a lower level, can provide a conceptual basis for discussing the construction of a security order in the Indo-Pacific region. Moreover, it is not necessary to cover all the following aspects and follow some kind of gradual historical process and cognitive process: Geographically, regionness embodies a geopolitico-economic space with specific distinguishable geographic boundaries; economically, regionness is the source of common markets, capital (financial), and knowledge (conceptual) for the countries concerned; culturally, regionness embodies the harmonious coexistence of multiple cultures; politically, regionness embodies a certain collective political will and political commitment to jointly build a regional order. 12"
Disputes About the “Indo-Pacific” Regional Security Order and China’s Vision of Regional Order,"Foreign Affairs Review , Ge Tengfei","May 3, 2021","As a region whose security relations can be discussed distinctly from other regions, because the Indo-Pacific region possesses lower-level regionness such as occupying a certain geographical space and having close regional economic ties, this provides a theoretical basis for discussing the issue of the security order in the Indo-Pacific region. Of course, we must point out that various countries currently have different views as to the geographic scope of the “Indo-Pacific” region. In the broad definition adopted by Japan, it is a broad area extending from the Pacific Ocean to the Indian Ocean and the east coast of Africa. In the narrow definition adopted by the U.S. strategic community, it refers to the area of the eastern Indian Ocean extending from the east coast of the Pacific Ocean [太平洋东岸, i.e. the west coast of the Americas] to the west coast of India. These differences in the definition of the geographic scope of the Indo-Pacific conceal differences in the strategic propositions and interests of the Indo-Pacific countries. However, for a scientific discussion of the regional security order, we must proceed from a general consensus on the geographic definition. As mentioned above, from the perspective of the regional security order, the definition of the geographic space of the Indo-Pacific region must be considered from at least the following two aspects: The first is that the region must feature convenient geographical transportation, moderate distances, and close economic ties, with the material reality or potential of regionness; the second is that the region must be closely connected in a certain security relationship, be clearly distinguishable from other surrounding areas, and possess a certain uniqueness as regards regional security. Therefore, an overly broad definition of the geographic scope of the Indo-Pacific region obviously does not meet our expectations for a “region”. A relatively clear and limited geographic framework is the condition for the Indo-Pacific to be a valid “region” in international politics. In fact, if we include the complete patchwork of regions from the Pacific Ocean to the peripheries of the Indian Ocean, with their very different geopolitico-economic and security characteristics, it can never constitute a “region.” Therefore, this paper adopts a relatively narrow perspective to define the Indo-Pacific region. That is to say, in geographic terms, the vast coastal and marine areas from the Western Pacific Ocean through Asia to the Eastern Indian Ocean include several sub-regions, such as the Western Pacific, East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, Oceania, and the East Indian Ocean. The southern part of the Asian continent, which consists of East Asia, Southeast Asia, and South Asia, is the geopolitical center of the Indo-Pacific region. This definition largely coincides geographically with the Asian supercomplex proposed by Buzan."

After the Obama administration took office, as the United States committed to ending the war on terror in the Middle East, Central and South Asia (Afghanistan, Pakistan) and other places, the emerging momentum in the Asia-Pacific region increasingly drew the attention of the United States and the world. The United States turned the focus of its strategic energy to Asia, so that Asia-Pacific became the priority direction of the attention of U.S. foreign strategy. However, while giving priority to Asia and the Western Pacific, the United States still had to take into account the security situation in the Middle East, the Persian Gulf, Central Asia, South Asia, and the northern Indian Ocean. Therefore, it was strategically necessary to create a more inclusive geospatial concept and create a power situation that could simultaneously deal with non-traditional security threats such as counter-terrorism and the needs of strategic competition among major powers. As stated in the Obama Administration’s 2010 National Security Strategy Report, “we must balance and integrate all elements of American power and update our national security capacity for the 21st century. We must maintain our military’s conventional superiority, while enhancing its capacity to defeat asymmetric threats.” 13 The shaping of the new strategy entails deepening cooperation with 21st-century centers of influence such as China, India, and Russia, as well as diplomatic and economic development cooperation with emerging partners from the Americas to Africa, from the Middle East to Southeast Asia. 14 It can be said that the geopolitical concept of “Indian Ocean–Pacific Ocean” (“Indo-Pacific” for short) originally launched by the Abe administration in Japan is in line with the strategic needs of the United States in terms of the two priorities of the Obama administration: economy and security. On October 28, 2010, then-U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton clearly put forward the “Indo-Pacific” concept in her speech in Hawaii, illustrating the changes in the geographical significance of the new U.S. policy in Asia. 15 In January 2012, in its defense strategy guide, Sustaining U.S. Global Leadership: Priorities for 21st Century, the United States implicitly proposed a new “Indo-Pacific” strategy using the wording “the arc extending from the Western Pacific and East Asia into the Indian Ocean region and South Asia.” 16 However, the Obama administration’s new foreign strategy design contained a massive contradiction, namely, that the United States must economically rely on emerging powers including China, but in terms of security, China is increasingly viewed as a strategic opponent. This irreconcilable contradiction eventually lead the latter view of China to dominate the former. In the process of implementing the strategy, the Obama administration was committed to attempting to turn the “Trans-Pacific Partnership” (TPP) into some kind of economic bloc that excluded China. In terms of security, they increasing strengthened alliance updates and deployments of forces aimed at resisting and suppressing China. As a result, this strategic design, which had some inclusive characteristics, increasingly became a strategic practice of comprehensive confrontation."

Disputes About the “Indo-Pacific” Regional Security Order and China’s Vision of Regional Order,"Foreign Affairs Review , Ge Tengfei","May 3, 2021","After the Trump administration came to power in 2017, it clearly viewed China as its primary strategic competitor and put forward three priorities in its National Security Strategy, political, economic, and military and security. The administration adopted a set of Indo-Pacific strategic designs with the construction of the U.S.-Japan-Australia-India quadrilateral mechanism (Quad) as the main path and an emphasis on strategic competition with China as the main direction. On January 5, 2021, the U.S. Strategic Framework for the Indo-Pacific declassified by the U.S. National Security Council in advance revealed the basic logic, strategic goals, and specific actions of this U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy. Its basic strategic logic was actually a simple “syllogistic” reasoning: the Indo-Pacific region will become the engine of U.S., regional, and even global economic growth; U.S. security and prosperity depend on access to the Indo-Pacific; therefore loss of primacy in the Indo-Pacific will undermine the ability of the United States to achieve its global interests. According to the document, one of the top interests of the United States in the Indo-Pacific region is to “Preserve U.S. economic, diplomatic, and military access to the most populous region of the world and more than one-third of the global economy.” The document then emphasized the so-called “China threat”, claiming that “Strategic competition between the United States and China will persist, owing to the divergent nature and goals of our political and economic systems. China will circumvent international rules and norms to gain an advantage. China aims to dissolve U.S. alliances and partnerships in the region. Chinese economic, diplomatic, and military influence will continue to increase in the near-term and challenge the U.S. ability to achieve its national interests in the Indo-Pacific region.” Therefore, the United States should work to promote the so-called “liberal economic order” in the Indo-Pacific region and prevent China from establishing a “new illiberal” influence. 17"

In December 2018, the U.S. Congress passed the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, which confirmed the implementation of the Indo-Pacific strategy in the form of legislation. On June 1, 2019, the U.S. Department of Defense released the public version of the Indo-Pacific Strategy Report, which, in terms of defense, emphasized that the United States should pursue “Preparedness, Partnerships, and Promoting a Networked Region,” to implement its lasting commitments in the Indo-Pacific. Its essence is to build a regional security relationship network with the Quad mechanism of the United States, Japan, Australia, and India as the core support, anti-China as the basic concept, and the fundamental purpose of ensuring the dominant security position of the United States. On November 4, 2019, the U.S. State Department issued another report titled A Free and Open Indo-Pacific: Advancing a Shared Vision. From the overall level of diplomacy, it emphasizes the need to strengthen and deepen partnerships with countries in the Indo-Pacific region such as Australia, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, ASEAN, and India, and even instigates the use of Taiwan to contain China. It advances a government-wide strategic approach, attempts to build a politico-security order that strengthens U.S. partnerships and jointly contains China, and creates a regionally polarized order in which China and the United States move towards comprehensive strategic competition."

The Trump administration even hopes to completely block the influence of China’s economic development path and cut it off from external markets and technology sources through an anti-globalization approach, so as to ensure that the exclusive economic position of the United States is not challenged. U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy documents emphasize that China’s different political and economic systems and China’s construction of a “new, illiberal sphere of interest” in the Indo-Pacific region challenge the liberal economic order represented by the United States. China is seeking dominance in cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence and biogenetics, and its dominance in such technologies will pose a fundamental challenge to free society in the United States. In terms of specific actions, the Trump administration has formulated the so-called Strategic Framework for Resisting China’s Economic Aggression [not the actual document title, probably refers to “United States Strategic Framework for the Indo-Pacific”], which seeks to increase technical assistance, development assistance and humanitarian assistance to Indo-Pacific countries and constrain the influence of China’s “Belt and Road” initiative; promote domestic economic reform in India, promote energy cooperation and technical cooperation between the United States and India, diversify India’s energy sources and supplies, strengthen investment in connectivity projects between India and other countries in the region, and accelerate the development of India’s national power; block China’s industrial policies and so-called “unfair trade practices” and strive to build a so-called “consensus that China’s industrial policies and unfair trade practices harm the global trading system;” maintain the innovative superiority of U.S. industries, promote the growth of critical U.S. technologies, work with allies to prevent China from acquiring strategic capabilities, and expand scrutiny of Chinese investments; and so on in the same vein. 18 Obviously, through its national protectionist perspective, the Trump administration has raised Sino-U.S. economic competition to the level of confrontation between countries and constructed its grand strategy of “economic-political-security” integration."

The chaos in U.S. domestic and foreign policies, the sharp decline in its international status, and widespread criticism from allies and the international community, in addition to factors such as the out-of-control epidemic, were also largely related to the Trump administration’s increasing focus on pursuing a Cold War-style policy agenda with the central mission of confronting China. After the Biden administration took office in early 2021, it fine-tuned the U.S. view of the Indo-Pacific region’s politico-security order, emphasizing uniting allies and partners, intervening in an ideologically based multilateral manner, and striving to restore the United States’ advantageous position in its power competition with China. Although the methods have changed, the dominant tone of the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy has not changed. In his phone call with President Xi Jinping on February 10, President Biden continued to use the phrase “maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific,” calling it one of the United States’ policy priorities. 19 In March 2021, the Biden administration issued the Interim National Security Strategic Guidance, which still clearly regards China as the primary strategic competitor of the United States. 20 After the Anchorage strategic dialogue, a new situation emerged in the strategic competition between China and the United States.

Rule shaping includes international economic rules, trade rules, legal rules, and environmental standards. It is an important means for the United States to focus on regulating China. A strong forward military deployment and presence is still the fundamental support of the U.S. government’s foreign policy. The Biden administration will even take a broader geopolitical or global perspective to deal with the Sino-U.S. strategic competition centered on the Indo-Pacific region. By strengthening the multilateralism of broader alliances and pursuing a certain “carrot and stick” negotiating strategy with China, they seek to build a security order in the Indo-Pacific region that is supported by the U.S. military’s powerful position, aimed at regulating and transforming adversaries, and realizes the United States’ own economic gains and politico-security interests."

The United States actively carries out Indo-Pacific geostrategic planning and implements strategic operations with political, economic, and military initiatives. It intends to firmly seize the huge opportunities brought by the economic and political development of the Indo-Pacific region and ensure the regional and world leadership of the United States. However, the quiet change in the balance of power between China and the United States makes it increasingly difficult for the United States to constrain China in services to its own regional influence and status. Due to the constraints of its own resources, the United States increasingly needs to rely on its allies for support and seek the cooperation of allies to advance its Indo-Pacific strategy. The practices of the Indo-Pacific strategy by the past three U.S. presidents are no exception. Mobilizing the enthusiasm of allies may allow the United States to concentrate relatively more resources in the near future. However, as the United States increasingly lacks effective strategic control mechanisms, this will inevitably stimulate the strategic independence and agency of countries in the Indo-Pacific region and will also induce more countries outside the region to increase their strategic attention and investment in the Indo-Pacific region. This will result in more complex changes in the regional power balance structure."

Japan took the lead in promoting “Asia’s Democratic Security Diamond,” launched the “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” strategic concept, and advocated for the “Asia-Africa Growth Corridor.” In its Defence White Paper 2013, Australia officially defined the region where it is located as the “Indo-Pacific”. The Defence White Paper 2017 more clearly defined the geographic scope of “Indo-Pacific” and discussed Australia’s commitment to a secure, open, and prosperous Indo-Pacific at length. India emphasizes building a strategic vision “rooted in the Indian Ocean and facing the Indo-Pacific” and is actively enhancing its visibility and voice in Indo-Pacific security affairs.

Under the banner of “Proactive Pacifism,” Japan seeks to normalize “national defense” and strengthen its independent defense capabilities. At the same time, with the parallel situations of “fulcrum construction” and “perimeter layout”, Japan is committed to using the core structure composed of Japan, the United States, India, and Australia (its “Democratic Security Diamond” concept) as the “fulcrum” and using a kind of grand strategic structure that connects key countries along the route from Southeast Asia, Oceania, South Asia, and the Middle East to Africa (its “Arc of Freedom and Prosperity” concept) as the “perimeter”. 21 By acting as the global “deputy sheriff” of the United States, Australia is striving to improve its international status and strengthen its own capacity building. Important documents such as the 2020 Defence Strategic Update and 2020 Force Structure Plan declared that Australia must be able to “respond with credible military force, when required.” 22 India emphasizes building a “strong and inclusive new India” to make India a major global political, economic, and military power. It is committed to developing its own defense capabilities, vigorously upgrading its equipment, and further promoting the implementation of its Act East policy. South Korea proposed a new southward-oriented policy to vigorously strengthen relations with ASEAN countries and India.

Small multilateral mechanisms with the U.S.-Japan relationship a the core and adopting the “U.S.-Japan+” model have been widely constructed, and the U.S.-Japan-Australia-India quadrilateral mechanism has been continuously promoted.

However, the various countries differ in their attitudes towards China. India clearly emphasizes the inclusiveness of its Indo-Pacific Vision and demonstrates its strategic independence, while Australia firmly stands by the United States.

European countries have always been highly sensitive to changes in international political power and they worry that changes in the power structure of the Indo-Pacific region will affect the interests of European countries. They have formed close economic and political ties with the Indo-Pacific region and are deeply afraid of missing out on the opportunities brought by the economic development of the Indo-Pacific region. In particular, France, the U.K., and Germany have proposed and outlined Indo-Pacific strategies, hoping to participate deeply in Indo-Pacific affairs. The European Union (EU) first proposed the concept of the Indo-Pacific as early as in its new security strategy released in June 2016, stating that it would expand its influence in the Asia-Pacific, the Indo-Pacific, and the world and actively adopt policy proposals to this end. In September 2018, the EU formulated its “Connectivity Strategy,” proposing a sustainable, comprehensive, and rules-based approach to connectivity and committing to strengthening the connectivity between Europe and Asia by building transport, energy, digital, and people connectivity, building international partnerships for sustainable connectivity based on bilateral, regional, and international cooperation, and making more and better investments in sustainable connectivity. 23"

In January 2017, then-British Prime Minister Theresa May formally proposed the diplomatic concept of “Global Britain.” The Indo-Pacific region became one of the three key areas of future British foreign policy, with increasing attention to Indo-Pacific affairs becoming an important part of the UK’s new diplomacy. To this end, the UK has vigorously strengthened its diplomatic ties with Japan and other Indo-Pacific countries, and regularly holds “2+2” talks with Japan, attended by the foreign minister and defense minister. It holds joint military training and defense and security exchanges with Japan and the United States, and frequently dispatched warships to the Indo-Pacific region, following the lead of the United States in “freedom of navigation” initiatives.

Disputes About the “Indo-Pacific” Regional Security Order and China’s Vision of Regional Order,"Foreign Affairs Review , Ge Tengfei","May 3, 2021","Traditionally, several security orders have existed in the Asian region. The first is the U.S.-led security order that has evolved from a hub-and-spoke pattern to a network-like system. After the start of the Cold War, the United States led the construction of a “hub-and-spoke” Asia-Pacific security system, with the United States as the hub and Asian allies as the spokes. After the Cold War, this basic form of security relations was consolidated and expanded for a time. At the beginning of the 21st century, after the United States proposed “Rebalancing Toward Asia-Pacific” and then the Indo-Pacific strategy, they made attempts to update this hub-and-spoke security system into a U.S.-led network-like system, with the cooperation between the United States, Japan, and Australia as the backbone and numerous small multilateral mechanisms jointly formed by the United States and its allies as the main forms. The second is the regional security order that gradually formed after the Cold War, with ASEAN as the center and “ASEAN+” as the model. Focusing on the ASEAN Regional Forum and the ASEAN Defense Ministers’ Meeting Plus, ASEAN established a multilateral security dialogue mechanism that includes the major forces in the region, leading to the gradual development of security mechanisms such as ASEAN and China, ASEAN Plus Three (with China, Japan, and South Korea), and the East Asia Summit. The third is the bilateral and multilateral regional security cooperation mechanisms jointly advocated by China and developing Asian countries and based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, including the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), the Conference on Interaction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia (CICA), strategic partnerships, the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India–China Border Affairs (WMCC), Code of Conduct (CoC) for the South China Sea consultation process, and the creation of a “Community with a Shared Future.” However, it must be noted that, due to natural concerns about the power of major powers, small and medium-sized countries tend to adopt foreign strategies that balance major powers and avoid one-sided participation in a security order dominated by one major power. This international political reality made the ASEAN-led regional security order more popular in the Asia-Pacific region. Major countries in the region such as China, Japan, and South Korea and extra-regional powers such as the United States successively joined this order. Therefore, ASEAN occupied the central role in the construction of the Asia-Pacific security order after the Cold War. As Wei Ling pointed out, from the perspective of the participation of various stakeholders in the Indo-Pacific region in regional processes, the regional consensus formed an “ASEAN-centric” path dependence. 31"
Disputes About the “Indo-Pacific” Regional Security Order and China’s Vision of Regional Order,"Foreign Affairs Review , Ge Tengfei","May 3, 2021","Looking at the Indo-Pacific strategies recently proposed by various countries, India still emphasizes maintaining the centrality of ASEAN in the construction of the regional security order to a certain extent, and has even pushed the U.S.-Japan-Australia-India Quad mechanism to support ASEAN’s centrality to some extent. However, the Indo-Pacific strategy promoted by the United States is actually not conducive to ASEAN’s leading role in the construction of the regional security order. The specific reasons are that: First, the Trump administration viewed the Quad mechanism of the United States, Japan, Australia, and India as the core, while the Biden administration may view the relationship between the United States and its allies as the core. These positions are, in fact, not conducive to the centrality of ASEAN. Second, the inclusion of the Indian Ocean in the Indo-Pacific strategy of various countries, following the lead of the United States, greatly expands the geographical scope of the Asia-Pacific and gives Australia and India a strategic position and role in the Indo-Pacific security framework. This naturally weakens ASEAN’s status in security affairs and faces ASEAN’s original East Asian-centered framework for the Asian security order framework with a complete restructuring. Third, the Trump administration promoted the construction of a polarized order based on Sino-U.S. strategic competition and even confrontation, which directly constricted the operational space for the construction of the ASEAN security order based on the guiding ideology of the balancing of great powers."
Disputes About the “Indo-Pacific” Regional Security Order and China’s Vision of Regional Order,"Foreign Affairs Review , Ge Tengfei","May 3, 2021","Of course, the increasing complexity of the regional security order also encourages ASEAN countries to use their own experience and agency to promote the establishment of a stable Indo-Pacific security order. As a major country in Southeast Asia, Indonesia’s foreign policy tradition is accustomed to adopt an Indian and Pacific Ocean perspective due to its status as an archipelago spanning the Pacific and Indian Oceans. In May 2013, at a conference on Indonesia held by the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, Indonesia’s then-foreign minister Mardi Natalegawa proposed the idea of signing an Indo-Pacific Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation. The proposal involved three major concerns of regional diplomacy: the crisis of confidence, unresolved territorial disputes, and managing regional change. This is consistent with ASEAN’s current regional security construction style, which advocates confidence building, peaceful resolution of conflicts, and security and echoes the 1976 Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia. To a certain extent, this proposal reflected the original intention of major ASEAN countries to shape the Indo-Pacific security order in the ASEAN way in the face of geopolitical changes in the Indo-Pacific region. As ASEAN’s largest economy, Indonesia’s regional political ambitions mean it does not want to see great power competition weaken ASEAN’s status as the “primary driver” in regional security. Its non-aligned policy tradition also makes it reluctant to become overly involved in security cooperation with the United States. After President Joko Widodo took office in 2014, he once again clearly put forward the two-ocean strategy, seeking to make Indonesia a “fulcrum country” in the Indo-Pacific region and thereby shaping the maritime order in the Indo-Pacific region and promoting regional and international cooperation. Led by Indonesia, ASEAN has gradually formed a unified position. 32"

ASEAN countries emphasized that the Asia-Pacific and the Indian Ocean region are closely integrated and interrelated regions, in which ASEAN plays a central role, and that the Indo-Pacific region is a region of dialogue and cooperation rather than competition and a region where everyone can achieve development and prosperity. The summit formed the ASEAN version of an “Indo-Pacific Strategy,” namely the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, which aims to promote the process of building an ASEAN community featuring the principles of cooperation, inclusiveness, common development, and ASEAN neutrality. ASEAN pointed out that there are four main areas of cooperation between Indo-Pacific countries—maritime cooperation, connectivity, the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and cooperation in economic and other areas, such as trade facilitation, digital economy, SMEs, climate change, and disaster prevention and management. 33 ASEAN’s strategic outlook for the Indo-Pacific proposes an inclusive route that promotes dialogue and cooperation, in stark contrast to the confrontational strategy of the Trump administration. They hope to redefine ASEAN’s role in shaping Indo-Pacific diplomatic, security, and economic arrangements and protect and promote the interests of ASEAN as a whole and individual ASEAN countries."

Disputes About the “Indo-Pacific” Regional Security Order and China’s Vision of Regional Order,"Foreign Affairs Review , Ge Tengfei","May 3, 2021","Geographical proximity determines mutual interests in regional security. Due to the complexity of the regional security situation and the instability it generates, forming a collective political will to jointly build a regional security order is a priority that needs to be considered in the process of building regionness. The Indo-Pacific region faces increasingly serious regional security issues. First, security tensions between countries are increasing rather than decreasing. Many countries in the region have increased their levels of defense spending, and some have adopted a more outward-looking defense strategy. The substantial increase in arms imports in the Asia-Pacific region, and even a relatively widespread situation of arms competition, is closely related to the return of the United States to the strategy of great power confrontation and the strengthening of its presence and military deployments in the Indo-Pacific. The United States has deployed its superior naval and air forces along with the most advanced combat platforms and weapon systems in the Indo-Pacific region, which has contributed to the military buildup of countries in the region. The U.S. uses the territorial and territorial water disputes between China and neighboring countries to “stir the pot” and play up the threat posed by China, emphasizing the need to enhance the capabilities of allies and partners and increase their coordination and military integration with the United States. All these factors have driven countries in the region, and especially the United States allies and strategic partners, to compete with each other for the purchase of U.S.-style advanced weapons. This upgrade of armaments will inevitably have a transmission effect between neighboring countries in the region, resulting in extensive arms competition in the region. U.S. strategies and policies have also increased the complexity of maritime disputes in the region and made them harder to resolve. The Sino-Japanese dispute over the Diaoyu Islands is further complicated by the interventions and statements of the United States. In April 2014, President Obama publicly stated that the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty applies to the Diaoyu Islands. After the Biden administration came to power, it once again explicitly intervened in the Diaoyu Islands issue. In the South China Sea dispute, the United States deliberately exaggerates the “China threat”, frequently launches “freedom of navigation” operations, maintains close strategic ties with relevant countries in Southeast Asia, and increased its strategic containment of China, further aggravating the situation in the South China Sea."
Disputes About the “Indo-Pacific” Regional Security Order and China’s Vision of Regional Order,"Foreign Affairs Review , Ge Tengfei","May 3, 2021","Second, disputes between countries exacerbate non-traditional security issues in regional societies. Small and medium-sized countries and developing countries in the region have invested resources in military and security construction, resulting in a general decline in the resources they can use for economic and social development. Under the influence of the pandemic, the economic situation has become more difficult, which has adversely affected the development of individual countries and the region as a whole and generated more social problems. This, combined with specific social soil (社会土壤, the unique social conditions of countries), provides inducements to various non-traditional security threats such as terrorism, drug problems, and transnational crimes. In fact, the security situation in the peripheral areas of the Indo-Pacific is fragile. There are many hot-button “issues,” such as ethnic and religious conflicts, transnational crime, drug smuggling, hunger and poverty, epidemic diseases, government incompetence, environmental degradation, refugees and their resettlement, and other widespread problems that have long been concerns of the region and the international community. The northern coast of the Indian Ocean is a fringe area in global politics and more likely to induce various factors of instability and spread them to Central and South Asia and Southeast Asia. In South Asia and Southeast Asia, regional conflicts caused by ethnic and religious issues as well as terrorism and extremism still pose challenges to regional security and endanger the regional security order."
Disputes About the “Indo-Pacific” Regional Security Order and China’s Vision of Regional Order,"Foreign Affairs Review , Ge Tengfei","May 3, 2021","In order to promote the formation of collective political will, as a regional public good, the construction of a regional security order should focus on the security demands of countries in the region and try to build a consensus on the security demands of all countries. Generally speaking, countries in the region are more interested in building a peaceful and stable local security environment than countries outside the region. The ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific emphasizes that “the rise of material powers, i.e. economic and military, requires avoiding the deepening of mistrust, miscalculation, and patterns of behavior based on a zero-sum game.” “It is in the interest of ASEAN to lead the shaping of their economic and security architecture and ensure that such dynamics will continue to bring about peace, security, stability and prosperity for the peoples in Southeast Asia as well as in the wider Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean regions or the Indo-Pacific.” 34 Japan’s Indo-Pacific vision likewise emphasizes the importance of regional peace and stability. As an island nation, Japan is very poor in resources and energy and highly dependent on foreign countries. It has a critical need for smooth and safe sea lines of communication. Therefore, it regards measures such as improving maritime law enforcement capabilities as one of the three pillars of its Indo-Pacific strategy and emphasizes international cooperation as one of the basic principles of its Indo-Pacific strategy. 35 India’s Indo-Pacific vision also stems from its changing national security environment and growing national security needs. For countries in the region, because of their basic need to seek a stable security environment, more emphasis is placed on dialogue and cooperation as opposed to conflict and confrontation. In its ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, ASEAN pointed out that one of the key factors in how it views the Indo-Pacific region is its view of the Indo-Pacific region as a region of dialogue and cooperation rather than confrontation. 36"
Disputes About the “Indo-Pacific” Regional Security Order and China’s Vision of Regional Order,"Foreign Affairs Review , Ge Tengfei","May 3, 2021","The construction of a regional security order should properly handle the relationships between large countries and small countries, strong countries and weak countries, and give priority to the security interests of weak and small countries in the region. Strong and large countries naturally have more means and resources to use to achieve national security than weak and small countries. Weak and small countries are naturally more anxious about national security than strong and large ones, and they are also more interested in the construction of a reasonable regional security order. For weak and small countries, it is difficult to have a real regional strategy. They have to seek a balance among powerful countries in order to ensure their own sovereign independence and seek to maximize the attainment of their economic and political interests. Facing an Indo-Pacific regional environment with strategic competition between China and the United States, the weak and small countries in the region do not actually want to see the intensification of competition and confrontation between the great powers of China and the United States as this would gradually diminish their room for maneuverer in pursuing a between the great powers, leaving them no choice can but to reluctantly pursue a hedging strategy. The weak and small countries in the region want to see that economic development and connectivity infrastructure construction in the Indo-Pacific region benefit themselves, but they are not willing to choose sides between China and the United States because they cannot afford the cost of confrontation with any great power. They prefer to de-securitize regional construction and development issues and see cooperation and dialogue between major powers so as to form a multilateral consensus around the path and mechanisms of regional construction and development. In addition, weak and small countries are more attentive to the challenges posed by some non-traditional security affairs to national security. For example, Sri Lanka, ASEAN island nations, and other coastal and island nations pay more attention to counter-terrorism and maritime security issues that threaten national security, such as piracy and armed smuggling at sea, illegal exploitation and utilization of marine resources, climate change and sea level rise, severe weather, and natural disasters, and urgently require the adoption of a collective and cooperative response. 37 In short, small and weak countries in the region are more concerned about the peace, stability, and development facilitation brought about by the regional security order and coping with specific security threats and challenges. A fair and reasonable regional security order must consider the security and development demands of small and weak countries in the region."
Disputes About the “Indo-Pacific” Regional Security Order and China’s Vision of Regional Order,"Foreign Affairs Review , Ge Tengfei","May 3, 2021","It must be noted that, unlike the Trump administration in the United States, which placed too much emphasis on weaving a network of security relations through the presence of military forces and strengthening strategic confrontation with China, most of the propositions on the Indo-Pacific order put forward by other countries around the world, including European countries, are inclusive in nature, and more non-U.S. forces inside and outside the region advocate maintaining or increasing cooperative relations with China. ASEAN places special emphasis on the inclusiveness of the Indo-Pacific order. From early on, Indonesia has explicitly supported the term “inclusive Indo-Pacific”. India has gradually made it clear that the Indo-Pacific region needs to emphasize inclusiveness. Japan’s position has also shifted from a “free and open Indo-Pacific” to a “free, open, and inclusive Indo-Pacific.”"

Disputes About the “Indo-Pacific” Regional Security Order and China’s Vision of Regional Order,"Foreign Affairs Review , Ge Tengfei","May 3, 2021","“Regionness” implies material ties from close economic exchanges within the region as well as the mutual recognition that the various countries are committed to promoting regional development. Looking at the Indo-Pacific strategies of various parties, whether or not they can seize the opportunities presented by the economic rise and significant development of the Indo-Pacific region and achieve or maintain their own economic prosperity, this is indeed one of the most basic goals pursued by all countries and one of the driving forces behind the construction of the Indo-Pacific order. Some scholars have pointed out that, for East Asian countries, security intrinsically has deep-rooted economic attributes. “Development is the essence of security” (安全以发展为要义) is the conception that serves as the backdrop for the practice of East Asian regionalism. An important background for the construction of the Indo-Pacific order is the rapid development and economic integration of East Asia in the past 30 years. In this process, unique models of practice for developing regionalism, represented by the ASEAN Plus Three cooperation mechanism, have been formed. The rise of China’s economy and the promotion of international cooperation in the joint construction of the “Belt and Road” further illustrate that China is playing an increasingly important role in the process of developing regionalism. The construction of the Indo-Pacific region with East Asia as its core region cannot be separated from the practical background of the development of regionalism in East Asia and the influence of China. 38 In fact, Democratic Party governments in the United States have long accepted the proposition that development issues are security issues. The Biden administration’s Interim National Security Strategic Guidance states that global development is the best means to express and embody American values while pursuing U.S. national security interests. 39"
Disputes About the “Indo-Pacific” Regional Security Order and China’s Vision of Regional Order,"Foreign Affairs Review , Ge Tengfei","May 3, 2021","In recent years, countries around the world have been hotly discussing the issue of infrastructure construction in the Indo-Pacific region. This shows that one of the key driving factors that has made the Indo-Pacific geospace a region of international attention is its huge demand for connectivity construction and the investment prospects and opportunities for economic profits this brings. Looking only at the growth of Chinese and U.S. foreign direct investment (stock) in 2019, the total annual growth of U.S. investments was U.S. $158.567 billion, of which growth in the Asia-Pacific region accounted for U.S. $67.23 billion, or 42% of total growth. The total annual growth of Chinese investments was U.S. $216.615 billion, of which the growth in the Asia-Pacific region was U.S. $183.589 billion, accounting for 85% of total growth. In the economic cooperation between China and the United States and the Indo-Pacific countries, infrastructure construction such as transportation accounts for a considerable proportion. Judging from the turnover data of China’s foreign contracted projects in 2019, China’s turnover in India, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, and Australia was 2.54 billion, 8.7 billion, 3.55 billion, 2.87 billion, 3.94 billion, and 3.92 billion USD respectively. Among U.S. investments in the Asia-Pacific region in 2019, investment in manufacturing industries such as computers and electronic products, transportation equipment, and electrical equipment components alone reached U.S. $83.576 billion. 40 Infrastructure construction also has a necessary and important significance. The construction of regionness must be based on the establishment of infrastructure that facilitates communication and exchanges within the region. This is also the basic requirement for the region to maintain a sustainable development process. In fact, from the first, the emergence of the concept of “Indo-Pacific” reflected the idea of economic connectivity between the two oceans. Economic connectivity also has important significance for the geopolitico-economic space of the Indo-Pacific. The Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean are important transportation routes for the global transport of commodities and raw materials. About two-thirds of global oil transportation and one-third of cargo transportation pass through trade routes in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. The Indo-Pacific region has clearly become a hub connecting East Asian production centers with key energy sources along the Indian Ocean coast. 41"
Disputes About the “Indo-Pacific” Regional Security Order and China’s Vision of Regional Order,"Foreign Affairs Review , Ge Tengfei","May 3, 2021","It is precisely based on the growing contradiction between the current level of connectivity infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific region and its massive connectivity status and demand in the world economy that the issue of connectivity infrastructure construction has been quickly put on the agenda of Indo-Pacific countries since the beginning of the 21st century. Transportation infrastructure remains the focus of cooperation among all parties, and transportation infrastructure projects represented by modern railway networks, highway networks, automated ports, and airports are key areas receiving support and attention from all parties. In October 2010, ASEAN announced its Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity, which proposed an ASEAN connectivity plan including infrastructure. In September and October 2013, China proposed the “Belt and Road” initiative, a significantly more ambitious interconnected infrastructure project focused on the Indo-Pacific region. China has also proposed the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, which is committed to promoting infrastructure construction and connectivity in Asia. Around 2012, several senior officials of the U.S. State Department, including then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, also proposed the idea of building an “Indo-Pacific Economic Corridor,” hoping to establish a South Asia-Southeast Asia economic connectivity network with India at the core. In 2015, U.S. President Barack Obama and the Indian government jointly issued the Joint Strategic Vision, emphasizing the importance of political and infrastructure connectivity: “To support regional economic integration, we will promote accelerated infrastructure connectivity and economic development in a manner that links South, Southeast and Central Asia.” 42 The U.S. National Security Strategy document released in December 2017 repeatedly emphasized the importance of infrastructure, mentioning infrastructure in 42 places. The document states that, in the Indo-Pacific region, the United States encourages regional cooperation and peaceful settlement of disputes to maintain free and open waterways, transparent infrastructure financing activities, and unhindered trade. It emphasizes cooperation with allies on high-quality infrastructure construction. 43 In 2019, the U.S. State Department published the document A Free and Open Indo-Pacific, which mentions infrastructure in 37 places. 44 At the end of July 2018, the United States also established a trilateral partnership framework with Australia and Japan to jointly build an investment framework for infrastructure development in the Indo-Pacific region and jointly mobilize investment in infrastructure. 45"

The 2014 G20 Summit in Brisbane specifically supported public and private investment in global infrastructure through the Global Infrastructure Initiative and established the Global Infrastructure Hub in Sydney. Since then, the issue of infrastructure construction and investment quality has received sustained attention from international organizations such as the G20, G7, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), and East Asia Summit. The G7 Ise-Shima Summit held in Japan in May 2016 also proposed five principles for promoting high-quality infrastructure investment, including effective management, promotion of local employment and capacity building, addressing social and environmental consequences, coordinating economic and development strategies, and improving the efficiency of resource use. 46 In September of the same year, the communique of the G20 Summit in Hangzhou, China further emphasized that investment in high-quality infrastructure is based on a combination of lifecycle costs, safety, resilience to natural disasters, job creation, capacity building, and the transfer of knowledge and expertise on mutually agreed terms so as to ensure economic efficiency while addressing the social and environmental impacts of projects and aligning them with economic and development strategies. 47 On September 6, 2016, ASEAN adopted a new version of the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity 2025 document in Vientiane, Laos, focusing on five strategic areas including sustainable infrastructure construction, digital innovation, logistics, import and export management, and human mobility.

Disputes About the “Indo-Pacific” Regional Security Order and China’s Vision of Regional Order,"Foreign Affairs Review , Ge Tengfei","May 3, 2021","The concept of region in international politics constitutes a kind of social existence in international politics. Its formation and establishment depend on the intertwined common beliefs held by international actors. The construction of a regional order is a negotiation process in which a regional community of practice forms shared beliefs, concepts, and norms through practices based on shared background knowledge. This is embodied in a process of constantly seeking and constructing “regionness.” Just as the regional concepts of “Europe,” “the Americas,” “Africa,” “East Asia,” and “Asia-Pacific,” all contain certain characteristic regional beliefs, regional cultures, and regional governance mechanisms, “Indo-Pacific,” as a regional construction, must not be an exception if it is to have long-term prospects. As a new structure, “Indo-Pacific” may not have manifested such things in an obvious way, but the existence of this new structure must have a material basis on which it is built. 48Otherwise, it will be difficult for this new structure to stand the test posed by time and space. The emergence of the Indo-Pacific concept reflects the increasingly close and inseparable economic and political ties between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean regions, and the increasingly close economic and political connection between the South Asia-Indian Ocean region and East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Western Pacific region. Geographically, it connects the two strategic regions of the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean and constitutes a strategic channel with great geostrategic value. It can be said that it is the deepening economic and political relationships between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean that constitute the cognitive basis and material foundation for the creation of the Indo-Pacific concept."
Disputes About the “Indo-Pacific” Regional Security Order and China’s Vision of Regional Order,"Foreign Affairs Review , Ge Tengfei","May 3, 2021","However, now that the “Indo-Pacific” region has been recognized in international politics, in addition to signifying huge opportunities for economic benefits, more attention should be paid to the regional culture, mechanisms, and order associated with this emerging “region.” The shaping of the “Indo-Pacific region” and the construction of a regional security order must conform to the basic attributes and historical logic connoted by the “regional” order. Taking a long-term view, this includes a set of security mechanisms and security culture dedicated to regional dispute settlement and regional integrity construction, a set of security concepts conducive to regional development and security cooperation, and a set of security governance mechanisms that help resolve regional issues. In fact, the tributary system that China once created in East Asia and its long-term peaceful exchanges with neighboring peoples, the long-standing cultural exchanges between China and South Asia and China and India along with the joint advocacy of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence by China, India, Myanmar, and other countries, and the series of cooperation mechanisms and frameworks among developing countries in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific region all constitute the historical accumulation and practical basis for the construction of the Indo-Pacific order. Major border incidents such as the Doklam standoff in 2017 and the Galwan Valley conflict in June 2020 almost led to conflict between China and India. However, China and India finally relieved the situation through bilateral political negotiations, commander-level talks, and other mechanisms, and the consensus reached by the leaders of the two sides to resolve the border issue peacefully once again withstood a test. To a certain extent, this illustrated the concept of peaceful negotiation and the historical and endogenous nature of the culture of peaceful coexistence among countries in the Indo-Pacific region. It also demonstrates the necessity of constructing a certain Indo-Pacific security order based on this security culture."

The most important situation facing the construction of a regional security order in the Indo-Pacific today is the management of the competition between the great powers of China and the United States. In the context of the basic situation of great power competition and even confrontation, how to examine and deal with the relationship between the two major regional propositions, namely, security and development, is a historic problem. Obviously, the question is not whether to give priority to security or development because the mandatory option of countries is to prioritize security. Without security, we cannot talk about development, so the development agenda is built upon the assurance of security. Therefore, the real question is, given the premise of prioritizing security, how should countries balance security and development?"
Disputes About the “Indo-Pacific” Regional Security Order and China’s Vision of Regional Order,"Foreign Affairs Review , Ge Tengfei","May 3, 2021","Further complicating the issue, the establishment of a security order in the Indo-Pacific region involves many countries outside the region. There are naturally differences between the concerns of countries in the region and countries outside the region. Generally speaking, the first thing countries outside the region see is the economic and political rise of the Indo-Pacific region and how this presents opportunities or harm to their own interests. Their primary concern is the positive or negative effect on their own interests, and their policy operations are inherently self-interested and quite speculative. For countries in the region, the regional security order is a basic and necessary public good. It is a combination of self-interest and altruism, with more emphasis on cooperation, common advantage, and mutual benefit. However, whether in terms of power structure or interest structure, the construction of a regional security order for the Indo-Pacific cannot completely exclude the views and demands of countries outside the region. The Indo-Pacific region maintains extreme openness in terms of both geopolitical reality and historical characteristics. 49 Of course, for the countries in the region, guiding the countries from outside the region to exert influence in a way that conforms to the consensus of the countries in the region is particularly important. This, in turn, depends on the formation of unity and consensus in terms of demands by countries in the region.

Disputes About the “Indo-Pacific” Regional Security Order and China’s Vision of Regional Order,"Foreign Affairs Review , Ge Tengfei","May 3, 2021","There are two very different security views in the Indo-Pacific region. One emphasizes power politics, such as hegemonic security and alliance security, which is essentially a self-interested and exclusive security order. The other emphasizes cooperative development, such as cooperative security and development security, and pursues an open security order. The regional security view that China upholds obviously belongs to the latter. As a regional economic power, China craves regional security. This determines that China can only pursue the latter’s essential attributes. To a large extent, the two aforementioned security views also reflect the different sociocultural conceptual structures of the international community. Alexander Wendt defined three international social structures with different cultural ideas, namely the Hobbesian, Lockean, and Kantian cultures of anarchy. 50 The Hobbesian culture is a culture that emphasizes struggle and confrontation, the Lockean culture implies the pursuit of a certain cooperative social relationship, and the Kantian culture hopes to achieve a permanent peace, a peaceful alliance that ends all wars. 51 In fact, because the East Asian region has inherited a cultural tradition of harmony guided by Chinese culture, it has formed a harmonious culture that emphasizes cooperation rather than confrontation. This is a shared cultural structure located between the Lockean and Kantian cultures. “In Chinese culture, the practical activities of farming society are the life foundation of this cultural body. As a result, more emphasis is placed on groups, more emphasis is placed on the relationships between group members, and more emphasis is placed on harmony between people and between people and nature, so that relationships becomes the core concept.” 52The core content of the ASEAN approach is also consensus, emphasis on national comfort, and non-interference in internal affairs. 53 Qin Yaqing pointed out that “‘Comfort’ is a unique norm for cooperation in East Asia. It serves as a key glue throughout the entire process of cooperation, preventing a relationship breakdown between the participating parties. Even in the most difficult times of cooperation, at the minimum, it allows the relationship to be maintained so that the cooperation process can continue into the future.” 54"
Disputes About the “Indo-Pacific” Regional Security Order and China’s Vision of Regional Order,"Foreign Affairs Review , Ge Tengfei","May 3, 2021","In the regional security order, as represented by China, this sort of sociocultural structure that values harmony naturally leads to a cooperative security view, which opposes hegemony and the willful use of force in confrontation, opposes realist power security, group-based security, and geopolitical confrontation, and even opposes polarization. It supports collaboration and coordination among major powers, emphasizing mutual respect, mutual trust, equal treatment, and mutual benefit among countries. At the practical level, China has always shown an inclusive attitude, and does not oppose but instead welcomes foreign countries to participate in the construction of the regional security order.

Whether in terms of influence or strength, China, as the primary representative of emerging economies in the Indo-Pacific region, has always been a model for implementing the cooperative development security view. China advocates that, under the framework of comprehensive cooperation and through open cooperation, collaborative development, and comprehensive policy implementation, we should explore the construction of regional or sub-regional mechanisms with unique characteristics and jointly find effective models and methods of good governance. At first, the “Belt and Road” initiated by China, the AIIB, the China-Indochina Peninsula Economic Corridor, the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor, the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation, and the China-Pacific Island Countries Economic Development and Cooperation Forum give the idea of mechanism construction in an economic sense, but their more far-reaching significance lies in their use of investment in infrastructure construction and economic development in developing Asian countries to improve the level of local development, resolve regional economic and security dilemmas, improve the level of regional governance, and promote the formation of a benign political and security order that can ensure long-term stability in the region. For example, under the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation framework, the six countries of China, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam have carried out a series of project cooperations to vigorously promote the economic and social development of Lancang-Mekong countries and accelerate interconnection. At the same time, they have strengthened cooperation in non-traditional security affairs such as disaster management, infectious disease prevention and control, combating illegal drug trafficking, terrorism, cybercrime, human trafficking, smuggling, and trafficking of firearms and ammunition, and border security management. China is committed to transforming the fruits of economic development into security outcomes shared with neighboring countries in Southeast Asia. 57 Driven by China’s “Belt and Road” and other development projects, countries in the region have successively issued their own economic development strategies, such as Pakistan’s New Pakistan, Laos’ Land-locked to Land-linked, and the Philippines’ Build! Build! Build!, promoting the overall development of the region. China is committed to implementing development strategy alignment and complementarity of advantages with countries along the route, transforming advantages such as mutual political trust, geographical proximity, and economic complementarity into practical cooperation and continuously increasing advantages. China emphasizes that the “Belt and Road” will first build a road to peace and then a road to prosperity. 58 This fully reflects the desire and path of promoting security cooperation and mutual political trust through development cooperation."

Disputes About the “Indo-Pacific” Regional Security Order and China’s Vision of Regional Order,"Foreign Affairs Review , Ge Tengfei","May 3, 2021","China believes that the construction of a regional security order in the Indo-Pacific is a prudent and step-by-step historical process. Undoubtedly, China’s continued adherence to the basic national policy of reform and opening up and its resulting continuous rise will become one of the decisive factors for the final formation of the Indo-Pacific security order. However, China’s contemporary rise has taken a soft approach in stark contrast to the rise of Western powers. Namely, China has become one of the leaders of the region and the world through the power projection and model influence of economic development. In terms of both psychology and policy, this is unacceptable to Western powers that are used to confrontation with hard power and they will inevitably resist this in their actions. However, in the history of Asia, China once held a dominant position of power for a long time, 59 and it possesses a natural psychological advantage and civilized self-confidence for dealing with and counteracting external forces."
Disputes About the “Indo-Pacific” Regional Security Order and China’s Vision of Regional Order,"Foreign Affairs Review , Ge Tengfei","May 3, 2021","The introverted and introspective spirit inherited from China’s thousands of years of civilization is the cultural origin of China’s prudent proposition to build a regional security order in the Indo-Pacific. The Analects of Confucius says: “The man of perfect virtue, wishing to be established himself, seeks also to establish others; wishing to be enlarged himself, he seeks also to enlarge others.” Mencius said: “If a man to rule others, and his government is unsuccessful, let him turn inwards and examine his wisdom. When a man’s person is correct, the whole kingdom will turn to him with recognition and submission.” At present, facing the complex regional security situation, China instinctively tends towards a regional strategy that is restrained, prudent, and not overly eager for success. In terms of development cooperation policies, China advocates doing what it can and doing its best, emphasizing the fulfillment of international obligations commensurate with its national strength. Within the framework of South-South cooperation, China will provide assistance to other developing countries within its capacity, will not do anything beyond the development stage of our partners that is not in line with their actual needs, and will not make “empty promises (空头支票, literally “write bad checks”). 60China maintains that the key to the process of building a regional order is to continuously promote the building of mutual trust in regional security through a series of specific measures for mutual learning between civilizations, economic exchanges, and people-to-people exchanges with people-to-people bonds as the core."
Disputes About the “Indo-Pacific” Regional Security Order and China’s Vision of Regional Order,"Foreign Affairs Review , Ge Tengfei","May 3, 2021","China’s prudence in building a regional security order is also due to the fact that its own national reunification has not been completed, and issues of sovereignty and territorial security have not been comprehensively maintained and consolidated. Regional security is built on the security of every country in the region, to say nothing of a major power in the region like China. While Western countries frequently smear and slander China’s political system and launch public opinion attacks and there are frequent incidents and interference in China’s territorial sovereignty and sovereign rights and interests, such as in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Xinjiang, the Diaoyu Islands, and the islands and reefs in the South China Sea, China’s maintenance of its own national security has also become an important part of regional security. The maintenance and assurance of China’s own national security is obviously the basic significance and unavoidable issue of the regional security order. In this regard, regional security can be fundamentally guaranteed only if all countries inside and outside the region participating in the establishment of the regional security order in the Indo-Pacific recognize that respecting the sovereignty and national security interests of other countries is a necessary precondition."
Disputes About the “Indo-Pacific” Regional Security Order and China’s Vision of Regional Order,"Foreign Affairs Review , Ge Tengfei","May 3, 2021","On the premise of ensuring national security resources, China can also exert its own influence in the construction of the regional security order. That is, through investment in domestic sustainable development, China is committed to creating regional and global “demonstration projects” (示范工程). China’s demonstrative role is reflected in two aspects: (1) the country’s governance capacity and mechanisms, and (2) its sustainable economic and social development. Since 2020, the Chinese government has vigorously promoted the construction of “new infrastructure,” promoted the digital transformation, intelligent upgrade, integration, and innovation of the infrastructure system as well as in-depth integration with 5G, blockchain, artificial intelligence, and other technologies, and successively implemented “new infrastructure” projects represented by smart transportation and smart cities. It is predictable that infrastructure projects empowered by technology will inject new impetus into the development of the “Belt and Road” countries, and the depth and breadth of infrastructure cooperation between China and the Indo-Pacific region are expected to expand further. 61 Although China’s own development is not aimed at becoming a regional and world leader, its demonstrative effect will be increasingly strengthened and, unable to be resisted by Western ideological prejudice, its influence will eventually radiate to the region and the world."

The mainland’s policy towards Taiwan should remain overall stable and maintain strategic determination, and in the face of the new international situation and the political reality on the island, a more focused and strong strategy must be taken to break through the present situation and promote cross-Strait relations so as to “overcome difficulties and move forward.”"

The Taiwan-related discourse in the 19th Party Congress report had already taken an important “home field” turn (i.e. focusing on one’s own side). On January 2, 2019, at the 40th anniversary meeting of the Message to Compatriots in Taiwan, General Secretary Xi Jinping clearly proposed an exploration of the “One Country, Two Systems” formula for Taiwan as a principled and open framework for cross-Strait political consultation and peaceful reunification.

"Exploring Institutional Preparations and Mentality Building for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan Formula","Modern Taiwan Studies , Tian Feilong","Jul 1, 2021","To resolve the Taiwan issue peacefully, the great concept of “One Country, Two Systems” was put forward and put into practice first in Hong Kong and Macau. “One Country, Two Systems” is a formula for peaceful reunification. Its essence is reunification, and its method is peace. Overall, it demonstrates China’s peaceful approach and goodwill towards compatriots in the Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan regions, as well as its fundamental moral criticism of the Cold War model, and its will to transcend it. The “One Country, Two Systems” concept is lofty, and its strategic goal is not only to achieve complete national reunification but also to try to resolve the binary opposition between socialism and capitalism through peaceful means and to demonstrate the strong inclusiveness and the superiority of socialism. This strategic vision, within the same sovereign order, uses the methods of recognition of a pluralistic governance system and the establishment of a constitutional system with the long-term coexistence of the state and the local, to explore the higher goal and vision of “One Country, Two Systems” and eliminating differences between the two “isms,” approaching a shared identity, and achieving integration. In this sense, the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula is of major institutional significance for achieving cross-Strait reunification and permanent peace and supporting the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation."
"Exploring Institutional Preparations and Mentality Building for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan Formula","Modern Taiwan Studies , Tian Feilong","Jul 1, 2021","In the speech from January 2, 2019, the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula is presented as a framework-like vision which is both based on Taiwan-related policy and is future-facing, proposed in response to the overall goal of national rejuvenation introduced at the 19th Party Congress and to the reality of cross-Strait relations. The vision incorporates both the fixed premise of “One China’s” sovereignty, security, and development interests and the flexible space for imagination of “One Country, Two Systems,” as well as a broad agenda and institutional prospects open to cross-Strait democratic consultation. The “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula is an inevitable requirement for national rejuvenation, and it is also a comprehensive practical proposition for seeking institutional breakthroughs in cross-Strait relations and completing the final reunification of the two sides."
"Exploring Institutional Preparations and Mentality Building for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan Formula","Modern Taiwan Studies , Tian Feilong","Jul 1, 2021","However, what this historical process represents is the creative development of Chinese civilization and its political system, and what it faces is the challenge of the Taiwan-centered so-called “democratic values” and the American hegemony behind it. From the Three Principles of the People of the KMT era to the Taiwan independence under DPP rule, the island is permeated with stigma against “One Country, Two Systems” and an opportunist mentality based on so-called “democratic values” and “relying on the United States and rejecting reunification.” In the external environment, the United States, based on hegemonic interests and strategic demands, continuously promotes the “self-arming” of the Taiwan authorities and carries out “stealth colonization” of the Taiwan region, pushing its allies to jointly guarantee Taiwan’s so-called “liberal and democratic” system. Thus, it ties the region to the “chariot” of China-U.S. strategic competition and geopolitical confrontation. It is the above-mentioned internal and external challenges and huge pressures that the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula needs to deal with and break through."

The typical features and essential elements of the formula include the following."
"Exploring Institutional Preparations and Mentality Building for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan Formula","Modern Taiwan Studies , Tian Feilong","Jul 1, 2021","First, firmly establishing “One Country” and its legal connotations, that is, China’s national sovereignty, security, and development interests are the fundamental premise and the object of institutional priority protection. No consultation, negotiation or design regarding “Two Systems” shall be permitted to harm this premise.

"Exploring Institutional Preparations and Mentality Building for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan Formula","Modern Taiwan Studies , Tian Feilong","Jul 1, 2021","Second, fully opening up the consultation space and room for negotiation of “Two Systems.” That is, under the premise that “One Country” has obtained political confirmation and institutional guarantee, cross-Strait political consultations and democratic negotiations can be fully carried out on the Taiwan region’s powers of autonomy covered by “Two Systems” and its flexible institutional arrangements, with the Chinese people on both sides of the Strait carrying out communication and design so as to account for the overall interests of the country and actual interests of the Taiwan region."
"Exploring Institutional Preparations and Mentality Building for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan Formula","Modern Taiwan Studies , Tian Feilong","Jul 1, 2021","Third, the peaceful reunification of the two sides of the Strait must adhere to treating the Chinese people on both sides of the Strait as the subjects in its scope, and resolutely oppose the interference of external forces and oppose the internationalization of the Taiwan issue."
"Exploring Institutional Preparations and Mentality Building for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan Formula","Modern Taiwan Studies , Tian Feilong","Jul 1, 2021","Fourth, for the smooth development of the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula, the mainland will take the initiative to create and provide various social and institutional conditions for cross-Strait peaceful consultations and democratic negotiations and will also severely crack down on Taiwan independence forces and external forces that undermine the peaceful reunification of the two sides of the Strait."

"Exploring Institutional Preparations and Mentality Building for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan Formula","Modern Taiwan Studies , Tian Feilong","Jul 1, 2021","In 2021, at the important time node of the centenary of the founding of the Party, General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important speech on July 1 once again made it clear that realizing the complete reunification of the two sides of the Strait is the historical task of the Chinese Communist Party. However, the situation of cross-Strait relations is more complicated and severe. Taiwan independence forces represented by the DPP are in control of the political situation in Taiwan and have been intensifying their collusion with external forces such as the United States and Japan, resulting in the disruption of normal cross-Strait exchanges and leaving the prospects of peaceful reunification unclear. The DPP attempts to seize the last window of opportunity for Taiwan independence, while external forces such as the United States and Japan will play the “Taiwan card” as a support to contain China’s rise and maintain geopolitical hegemony. Although the option of “abandoning Taiwan” and its related reasoning have existed within inner U.S. decision-making circles for a long time, it is unlikely to become a reality in the short term. At the same time, the structural changes in the concept and system of “One Country, Two Systems” brought about by the central government’s decisive action in response to the changing situation in Hong Kong have been stigmatized and misunderstood on the island, resulting in a weakening of the demonstration effect of the Hong Kong experience on Taiwan."
"Exploring Institutional Preparations and Mentality Building for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan Formula","Modern Taiwan Studies , Tian Feilong","Jul 1, 2021","At this stage, the dominant idea of the mainland’s policy towards Taiwan remains to maintain and continue the traditional discourse of “peaceful reunification, one country, two systems” and actively explore the political position of the “two systems” Taiwan formula. The focus of this is on promoting integration and opposing Taiwan independence, serving the greatest interests of national rejuvenation and the historical task of cross-Strait reunification. We should keep pace with the times and seek comprehensive ideas and strategies for breaking through the situation based on changed China-U.S. relations and cross-Strait relations."
"Exploring Institutional Preparations and Mentality Building for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan Formula","Modern Taiwan Studies , Tian Feilong","Jul 1, 2021","In recent years, the situation in the Taiwan Strait has become increasingly complex and severe, which not only severely counteracts the basic consensus and mutual understanding accumulated over the past decades, especially during the eight years of Ma Ying-jeou’s governance from 2008 to 2016, but also slips towards cross-Strait “cold confrontation” and oppositional popular opinion. This may even be further entangled and exploited by the United States’ strategic competition with China and its strategic arrangements for comprehensively containing the rise of the Chinese mainland. Difficulties and challenges in exploring the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula include but are not limited to:"
"Exploring Institutional Preparations and Mentality Building for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan Formula","Modern Taiwan Studies , Tian Feilong","Jul 1, 2021","First, the objective reality of cross-Strait political opposition. From a legal point of view, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are still in a state of continuation of the civil war between the KMT and the Communist Party and have not signed a peace agreement or the relevant constitutional arrangements for cross-Strait reunification. Taiwan authorities still have “diplomatic relations” with a certain number of states and receive international support from the U.S. Taiwan Relations Act and international anti-China forces and actions. The mainland’s actual influence, control, and guidance on the political trends and internal governance system of the island is extremely limited. The long-term continuation and intergenerational replacement of this state of political opposition may exacerbate the political risk and separation of people across the Taiwan Strait."
"Exploring Institutional Preparations and Mentality Building for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan Formula","Modern Taiwan Studies , Tian Feilong","Jul 1, 2021","Second, the “1992 Consensus” has been politically blocked for a long time by the DPP, and the island’s political impetus for it to regain confirmation is seriously insufficient. The “1992 Consensus” is the ballast stone for the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations and the logical starting point for institutional interaction. However, the continuous blocking by the DPP has fundamentally damaged the institutional foundation for normalized exchanges and cooperation between the two sides of the Strait, and the odds that it can be repaired in a short period of time are slim. Under these conditions, the levels, effect, and sustainability of cross-Strait regularized exchanges, communication and cooperation, and the institutional expectations for peaceful reunification, all show a downward trend."
"Exploring Institutional Preparations and Mentality Building for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan Formula","Modern Taiwan Studies , Tian Feilong","Jul 1, 2021","Third, the United States and Japan have stepped up their use of the “Taiwan card” in their geopolitical strategies, leading to a trend of “quasi-colonialization” in the Taiwan region. On the one hand, the intensification of the new situation of strategic competition between China and the United States and the involvement of Japan have led to the continuous deterioration of the situation in the Taiwan Strait. On the other hand, the more the cross-Strait power balance shifts to mainland China, the more Taiwan authorities rely on the United States and Japan, causing Taiwan to transfer more actual “governance authority” to external forces, shifting to a “quasi-colonial” state. With this, the basic conditions for cross-Strait political consultation are weakened, resulting in the actual rise of the “proxy” of the United States and Japan in Taiwan, creating obstacles to the peaceful reunification of the two sides of the Strait."
"Exploring Institutional Preparations and Mentality Building for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan Formula","Modern Taiwan Studies , Tian Feilong","Jul 1, 2021","Fourth, the island’s “electoral democracy” and the political identity of the young generation have undergone changes that are not conducive to the peaceful reunification of the two sides of the Strait. 7 For a long time, the DPP has been using the building of “Taiwan local consciousness” and a “Taiwan independence” policy system to coerce the Taiwanese people and poison the young generation, and has been drawing on “legal” tools for governing to attack reunification forces. It is very difficult to see hope in the island’s elections turning things around and returning to the “1992 Consensus” framework. Hung Hsiu-chu and Han Kuo-yu’s political setbacks on the island are examples. Without the strong and stable support of mainstream public opinion on the island, cross-Strait political consultations aimed at peaceful reunification are lacking the basic conditions to get restarted and find representativeness in public opinion on the island."
"Exploring Institutional Preparations and Mentality Building for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan Formula","Modern Taiwan Studies , Tian Feilong","Jul 1, 2021","Fifth, the demonstrative effect of Hong Kong’s “One Country, Two Systems” practice for Taiwan is not optimistic in the short term. Using Hong Kong as a demonstration model for Taiwan is an important part of the central government’s implementation of the “One Country, Two Systems” strategy and an important way to achieve peaceful reunification across the Taiwan Strait. Thus, the DPP has always attached great importance to and strongly intervened in the political development of Hong Kong and has adopted the strategy of “stigmatizing” and hedging the practice of “One Country, Two Systems” in Hong Kong. After the “Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement” of 2019, the formulation and implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law in 2020, and the revision and improvement of the SAR election system in 2021, the “One Country, Two Systems” model in Hong Kong has been rationally upgraded to version 2.0, foregrounding the central government’s comprehensive governing authority, national security, election security, and patriots governing Hong Kong. The legal theory and power of a high degree of autonomy have been structurally reshaped. However, under the stigma attached to them by the Taiwan independence forces, the above-mentioned events may lead to an increase in the negative evaluation of the “One Country, Two Systems” Hong Kong practice on the island of Taiwan. The relationship itself between Hong Kong and Taiwan is also showing a trend toward worsening, such as Hong Kong independence elements fleeing to Taiwan, and the revocation of representative offices between Hong Kong and Taiwan. U.S. negative comments and sanctions on Chinese Hong Kong will also have a negative guiding effect on popular opinion on the island of Taiwan. How the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula and the new changes in Hong Kong practice can be given an inherently self-consistent explanation will become an important theoretical and propaganda challenge for the central government in the future."
"Exploring Institutional Preparations and Mentality Building for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan Formula","Modern Taiwan Studies , Tian Feilong","Jul 1, 2021","Sixth, in the context of normalized COVID-19 prevention and control, under the DPP Taiwan independence forces’ political manipulation, cross-Strait isolation, communication difficulties, and a “cold reception” in epidemic control cooperation mean that the epidemic has not just failed to become a true touchstone and glue to bind the “cross-Strait family” and the “community of with a shared future,” conversely, it has become a political opportunity for the DPP authorities to frantically smear the mainland’s epidemic control efforts, block the mainland’s vaccination aid to Taiwan, and disrupt peaceful exchanges between the two sides. A small number of Taiwan compatriots coming to the mainland for vaccination cannot promote true cross-Strait anti-epidemic cooperation. The unfair treatment of Taiwan compatriots with mainland spouses or children in relation to epidemic control guarantees and vaccine distribution may also further intensify opposition in popular opinion on the two sides of the Strait."
"Exploring Institutional Preparations and Mentality Building for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan Formula","Modern Taiwan Studies , Tian Feilong","Jul 1, 2021","In fact, the above-mentioned difficulties and challenges faced in cross-Strait relations have a long history. They did not form overnight, nor can they be solved overnight. As such, we can consider adopting the following countermeasures to further improve the institutional system and create the most favorable foundation and conditions for exploring the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula."
"Exploring Institutional Preparations and Mentality Building for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan Formula","Modern Taiwan Studies , Tian Feilong","Jul 1, 2021","First, make preparations on “both hands” for achieving cross-Strait reunification and grasp the initiative and dominance in work on Taiwan. Although “peaceful reunification, one country, two systems” is the best outlook and institutional setup for cross-Strait relations, the “non-peaceful approach” in the Constitution and the Anti-Secession Law is also one option for national reunification. The intervention of external forces also gives the mainland no choice but to make “both-handed” preparations for realizing cross-Strait reunification. For one thing, the United States has stepped up legislation related to Taiwan and “recolonized” the Taiwan region, which has led to the U.S. “One China policy” trending towards a “hollowing out.” At the same time, Japan’s opportunistic geopolitical policy has led to its increasingly direct involvement in Taiwan Strait affairs, such as its Defense White Paper position. Induced by the bewitchment of the United States and Japan and the DPP’s own ideas, the actions of Taiwan independence separatists have intensified on the island, and their opportunistic and risky nature cannot be underestimated. The mainland must prepare on “both hands” to use peaceful and non-peaceful means to achieve cross-Strait reunification. In particular, the more fully prepared the non-peaceful reunification plan is, the greater the possibility will be of achieving peaceful reunification, and as the mainland’s ability is to deal with any unexpected events grows stronger, the increasingly clear the strategic deterrent effect will be on the United States, Japan, and Taiwan independence forces."
"Exploring Institutional Preparations and Mentality Building for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan Formula","Modern Taiwan Studies , Tian Feilong","Jul 1, 2021","Second, based on rule of law thinking, accelerate the improvement of the legal system to oppose independence and promote reunification and make full use of legal weapons to engage in anti-independence struggle and promote the reunification process. At present, the legal arsenal in the mainland to oppose independence and promote reunification awaits perfecting. On the one hand, the Anti-Secession Law needs to be interpreted and revised to keep pace with the times, and its precise applicability is not yet sufficient.8 On the other hand, a “national reunification law” 9 based on the needs of cross-Strait reunification in the new era is missing, and the principles, standards, procedures, paths, and law enforcement powers of cross-Strait reunification are unclear. Judging from the available legal tools, although the Anti-Secession Law, the Hong Kong National Security Law, and the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law have certain regulatory functions, this is clearly still insufficient in terms of the legal support needed for national reunification. We must carry out rigorous planning and accelerate the improvement of the anti-independence, reunification promoting legal system, which includes not only the interpretation and revision of the Anti-Secession Law, but also the planning and laying out of a “national reunification law.” It should also involve the precise application of the Taiwan-related provisions in the Hong Kong National Security Law and the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law, demonstrating upon different levels the national will and legal action capability for resolving the Taiwan issue in accordance with the law and for governing Taiwan after reunification."
"Exploring Institutional Preparations and Mentality Building for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan Formula","Modern Taiwan Studies , Tian Feilong","Jul 1, 2021","Third, comprehensively and accurately explain and interpret the legal principles and institutional system of Hong Kong’s “One country, Two systems” and provide positive normative guidance for exploring the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula. 10 The Hong Kong practice of “One Country, Two Systems” has proved that the “One Country, Two Systems” system design that simply delegates power and benefits is not an ideal and sound solution, and effective institutional arrangements for state authority must be made at the beginning of system configuration. The explanation of the principle of “One Country, Two Systems” should focus on four levels: first are the basic aspects of national sovereignty and its institutionalization, including the institutional guarantees for national security and development interests. Second is the globalization aspect of “One Country, Two Systems.” That is, Taiwan needs to flexibly allocate its rights and interests in accordance with its global status and role. The new concept of globalization is not about simply relying on and participating in the international system dominated by the West but rather is based on the Belt and Road Initiative and the construction of a community with a shared future for humankind. Third, in terms of national education and cultural dominance, the state must have the power and responsibility for supervision and planning, and “patriots governing” should also become the cornerstone of the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula. Fourth, if Taiwan is to achieve permanent peace and long-term development, this can only be ensured by relying on the single option of reunification; this point must be clearly explained."
"Exploring Institutional Preparations and Mentality Building for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan Formula","Modern Taiwan Studies , Tian Feilong","Jul 1, 2021","Fourth, make policy upgrades for cross-Strait integrated development. The mainland has issued many policies to benefit Taiwan in the past, but there is a lack of reasonable distinction between national standards and local standards and standardized operations in implementation. The mainland is still slightly conservative in terms of policy scope, and the strength and sustainability for driving cross-Strait integration and development remain insufficient. As such, the following is recommended: first, clear up and evaluate Taiwan-friendly policies and sort out unified national standards as the minimum standards for each locality’s implementation. On this basis, encourage all localities to introduce local standards according to local conditions, forming a policy system for benefiting Taiwan that has the same policy objectives but reasonable differences in different regions and give clear and visible guidance to Taiwan compatriots. Second, implementing the principle that the “equal treatment” of Taiwan compatriots is not national treatment as foreigners but equal treatment as Chinese citizens requires considering expanding, in an appropriate and orderly way, from an economic and wellbeing level to the level of public affairs and administration. In this regard, the “equal treatment” of Hong Kong and Macau compatriots has made certain breakthroughs and recruitment for public institutions and for civil servants include a reasonable proportion open to compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau. Taiwan policies should also be upgraded accordingly. Third, explicitly incorporate content related to the Chinese Communist Party in the curriculum of national-conditions training and teaching at all levels for Taiwan students and people from all walks of life in Taiwan, and establish a clear and complete common sense of national history, politics, and institutions. This will help with the institutional design and governance practice of the follow-up “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula. Fourth, focus on cultivating a new generation of young intellectual leaders, political leaders, and industry leaders among Taiwan students and compatriots. Shift away from the original passive, coping, waiting, and traditional approaches and concepts that focus more on guidance by interests. Break the stigmatizing and confrontation by the DPP by using the “youth-to-youth” united front and competitive thinking. Focusing on young people’s futures and the process of personal development, guide Taiwanese youth to actively “go west” and join in the historical task of promoting the peaceful reunification of the two sides of the Strait, cultivate their new political notion that “we have a share in the reunification of the two sides of the Strait, we are responsible for governing Taiwan, and we are the masters of Taiwan’s future.”"

"Exploring Institutional Preparations and Mentality Building for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan Formula","Modern Taiwan Studies , Tian Feilong","Jul 1, 2021","“One Country, Two Systems” is a brand-new institutional experiment, a functional integration of national reunification and national modernization, and represents the institutional dialectical thinking and progressive historical philosophy of the Chinese Communist Party for governing the country. Though ancient China and the West had different forms of “one country, many systems,” the political environment faced in that classical system cannot compare to the capitalist and socialist dualistic world system in which “One Country, Two Systems” is found and the depth and brutality of the system’s institutional struggle. Therefore, “One Country, Two Systems” must be an innovative historical practice. The “One Country, Two Systems” strategic vision originated from the Taiwan issue, is being implemented first in Hong Kong and Macau, and will inevitably end with the resolution of the Taiwan issue. As far as the demonstrational nature of the system is concerned, the Hong Kong experience of “One Country, Two Systems” is the most intuitive and enlightening for Taiwan, and it will therefore inevitably become the primary target of smearing and attacks by Taiwan independence forces. The legal theory and institutional development of the practice of “One Country, Two Systems” in Hong Kong has important significance as a guide and reference for exploring the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula."
"Exploring Institutional Preparations and Mentality Building for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan Formula","Modern Taiwan Studies , Tian Feilong","Jul 1, 2021","As far as Hong Kong’s whole experience of practicing “One Country, Two Systems” is concerned, system building and mentality building are equally important, or the latter may even be more important. In terms of system building, Hong Kong’s experience is roughly as follows: first, the central government’s political decision came first. That is, as early as 1982, Article 31 of the Constitution left constitutional space for the special administrative region, and then in April 1983, the central government officially adopted the 12 policy guidelines on “One Country, Two Systems.” Second, the Sino-British Joint Declaration incorporated and endorsed the 12-point policy of the “One Country, Two Systems,” and the Basic Law of Hong Kong transformed “One country, Two systems” into law, using the principle of rule of law to uphold established policies, maintaining their stability and continuity. Third, setbacks and progress coexisted in the construction of specific systems. Specifically, there have been setbacks in Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23-related national security legislation and national education. There has also been an accumulation of experience in constantly exploring and practicing the mode of exercise of central governance. With this comes stronger understanding about, and responses to, the risks of “One Country, Two Systems” and the laws of its system building. Fourth, introducing the “comprehensive governing authority” legal principle and the “One Country, Two Systems” institutional system building requirements, formulating the Hong Kong National Security Law and improving the SAR election system, and observing the basic principle of “patriots governing Hong Kong” have all been driving the practice of “One Country, Two Systems” in Hong Kong to enter version 2.0 with ample legal theory, rigorous systems, and deepening social approval. The basic experience of building these systems provides important reference for exploring the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula. General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important speech at the 40th anniversary of the Message to Compatriots in Taiwan not only discussed the space of “Two Systems” from an institutional perspective but also attached great importance to the premise of “One Country” and its institutional guarantees, especially emphasizing that any institutional design must guarantee national sovereignty, security, and development interests."
"Exploring Institutional Preparations and Mentality Building for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan Formula","Modern Taiwan Studies , Tian Feilong","Jul 1, 2021","It is relatively easy to construct a rationally conceived system, but the mentality building of communication to the heart is not simple. Still taking Hong Kong as an example, although the Constitution, the Basic Law, and the Hong Kong National Security Law have formed an increasingly strict “One Country, Two Systems” legal system, one could not describe the socio-political foundation and cultural identity of “patriots governing Hong Kong” as deep-seated and reliable, and there may even be adverse currents and conflicts. First, the setback in the implementation of Article 23 legislation and national education in Hong Kong shows the spiritual resistance of a portion of people in Hong Kong society to national security and national identity. Second, the rapid development of “nativism” in Hong Kong and its having become a social movement pose serious risks to the security of the “One Country, Two Systems” system and have misled some Hong Kong youths into the disobedience of the so-called “revolution of the times.” Third, the serious infiltration and manipulation of Hong Kong’s cultural institutions and election process by external forces has damaged some Hong Kong people’s understanding of and identification with the country. Fourth, Hong Kong’s education, media, justice, and other fields that shape public opinion and social values are filled with ideological and organizational networks of “opposing China and disrupting Hong Kong” and have become the focus of political conflict. Fifth, on the first anniversary of the implementation of the National Security Law in Hong Kong there still transpired the “July 1 stabbing of a Hong Kong police officer” sparking public opinion turmoil (the employee of Vitasoy Hong Kong committed suicide after attacking the police officer, and the company issued a statement saying that the perpetrator had “unfortunately passed away” and sent “deep condolences”; the Hong Kong University Students’ Union Council “mourned” the rioter who attacked the police officer). As well as this there has been the recent spate of resignations of district councilors and the “non-cooperation in elections” in the later period, proving that the “return of people’s hearts” in Hong Kong is still a severe challenge and an incomplete task.11 The practice of “One Country, Two Systems” in Hong Kong still needs to go through a difficult process of institutional transformation and mentality reconstruction."
"Exploring Institutional Preparations and Mentality Building for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan Formula","Modern Taiwan Studies , Tian Feilong","Jul 1, 2021","The DPP and other Taiwan independence forces, with ideology and political interests as their point of departure, have long been interfering in Hong Kong affairs and stigmatizing “One Country, Two Systems.” On basic issues involving China’s national sovereignty, security, and development interests, they have carried out a series of political operations such as “local prioritizing” and “foreign-derived self-enhancement,” not hesitating to endanger national security or betray national interests. Even in epidemic prevention and control, which relates to the lives and safety of people on both sides of the Strait, they were unable to adhere to the idea of “one family on both sides of the Strait” and interact and cooperate closely with the mainland. Therefore, learning from the Hong Kong experience of “One Country, Two Systems” to explore the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula cannot look only at the “high degree of autonomy,” simply pondering how to give Taiwan a higher degree of autonomy. Rather, we should also attach great importance to the state power and interests level, especially to system building at the level of national security, national education, and cultural leadership, and we must undertake prior research and policy design. We must also attach great importance to doing the related mentality building."
"Exploring Institutional Preparations and Mentality Building for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan Formula","Modern Taiwan Studies , Tian Feilong","Jul 1, 2021","This shows that we need to face up to the political and cultural difficulties that may exist in the specific implementation of the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula. In particular, we must clearly see the fierce resistance and struggle from the levels of both legal theory and mentality by Taiwan independence forces such as the DPP and external intervening forces. First, the primary difficulty in mentality building lies in the struggle for values. The main weapons of mentality struggle for Taiwan independence are “nativism” and “democracy.” This is a combination of local nativism and the West’s so-called “universal democratic values” and is in an oppositional relationship with the patriotism upon which the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula is based and with the rule of law philosophy of having “two systems coexist.” Second, the United States has been turning Taiwan into a chess piece and a battlefield and has continuously promoted Taiwan-related legislation and decision-making, resulting in Taiwan’s “democratic hollowing out,” dependence, and “quasi-colonialization.” Taiwan appears to be democratic in form, but under the influence of American hegemony, it has lost its democratic national sentiment, political reason, and self-determination. Third, the Taiwan independence nationalism of the DPP authorities and the KMT’s deepening awareness of local separatism or Taiwan independence have caused Taiwan to develop, ideologically and culturally, a mixture of radical Taiwan independence and “little happiness” civic culture. This has been continuously eroding the cultural, psychological, political, and social foundations of the peaceful reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. Fourth, the Taiwan authorities have revised the “Five National Security Demands” and formulated the Anti-infiltration Act under the “legal system” to obstruct cross-Strait peaceful exchanges and cultural exchanges, to deter or even punish reunification forces that respond to the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula, and to create a comprehensive cultural atmosphere of terror and institutional pressure for “rejecting reunification.” Fifth, is the painting of all cross-Strait exchanges and all the mainland’s efforts toward promoting reunification as “united front-ified” and “hostile” efforts, which greatly compresses the limited space for cross-Strait cultural interaction and institutional negotiation. Moreover, a continued exaggeration of the negative image and false threat of the mainland with anti-intellectual media hegemony has deteriorated public perception and understanding of the people on both sides of the Strait."
"Exploring Institutional Preparations and Mentality Building for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan Formula","Modern Taiwan Studies , Tian Feilong","Jul 1, 2021","In this context, the conceptual update and system building that are taking place in the practice of “One Country, Two Systems” in Hong Kong must keep pace with the times on the basis of its mentality and culture, and it is precisely this level that must be recognized as greatly important when exploring the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula, requiring serious thinking and careful development."
"Exploring Institutional Preparations and Mentality Building for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan Formula","Modern Taiwan Studies , Tian Feilong","Jul 1, 2021","First, clarify the national legal theory and institutional premise of “One Country, Two Systems.” We need to systematically explain the legal and cultural basis of “One Country, Two Systems,” especially with regard to national sovereignty, security, and development interests, as well as the system of “comprehensive governing authority” and “One Country, Two Systems.” In this regard, the white paper The Practice of “One Country, Two Systems” in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, first published by the central government on Hong Kong affairs in 2014, is still an indispensable key policy document. This white paper is an authoritative judgment of the central government on the basic experience and future direction of the practice of “One Country, Two Systems” in Hong Kong’s 17 years since return (1997–2014). It sets out clearly for the first time the core legal theory and concept of “comprehensive governing authority,” and has reorganized the complete institutional logic of “One Country, Two Systems,” highlighted the principle of “patriots governing Hong Kong,” and also put forward a more complete and basic way of thinking for preventing Hong Kong’s “local” forces and external forces from interfering in, and undermining, “One Country, Two Systems” that is more in line with the requirements of the modernization of national governance in the new era. It has become a new policy guide for the practice of “One Country, Two Systems” in Hong Kong. 12 The basic legal basis and policy basis for the formulation and implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law, the revision and improvement of the SAR election system, and the deepening of related governance areas can be found in this white paper."
"Exploring Institutional Preparations and Mentality Building for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan Formula","Modern Taiwan Studies , Tian Feilong","Jul 1, 2021","Second, pay more attention to the reasonable existence and institutional space of national security and the national leadership system in “One Country, Two Systems.” We need to go further in clearly explaining that without national security, there will be no stable and long-term “One Country, Two Systems,” let alone a “high degree of autonomy” for democratic politics. This logical chain must be articulated clearly and visibly, and at the same time, the bottom line, standards, due process, and protective functions of the national security rule of law must be made clear to Taiwan compatriots using the popularization and case studies of the National Security Law in Hong Kong. During the process of the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula’s macro conception, the one-China sovereign order should be better maintained. On the one hand, in traditional fields such as national defense and diplomacy, national security, political security, national education, and other fields that directly affect national sovereignty, security, and development interests, there must be an initial legislative configuration and a bottom line of principles; they cannot be sacrificed in the negotiation and compromise process for the “Two Systems” solution. On the other hand, under this security premise, Taiwanese society’s institutional retention, autonomous design, and international participation can take into account local conditions, with flexible negotiation and rational allocation, reflecting the institutional inclusiveness and creativity of “One Country, Two Systems.”"
"Exploring Institutional Preparations and Mentality Building for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan Formula","Modern Taiwan Studies , Tian Feilong","Jul 1, 2021","Third, based on proper, complete, and outstanding Chinese traditional culture, deepen the cross-Strait cultural blood and common bond, unite intellectuals and young people on both sides of the Strait to jointly advance the historical retrospective, consensus building, and legal consensus of the “cross-Strait community with a shared future.” In the future, we should build a cultural system of socialism with Chinese characteristics based on outstanding traditional Chinese culture, with the goal of realizing national rejuvenation and building a community with a shared future for humankind, jointly deepening the cultural content of the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula."
"Exploring Institutional Preparations and Mentality Building for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan Formula","Modern Taiwan Studies , Tian Feilong","Jul 1, 2021","Fourth, we must achieve common progress across the Taiwan Strait and make unique contributions to humankind in new globalization development and cultural creation. Chinese culture is a widespread culture of the eastern civilizational kind, with the character of a noble person embodied in the saying that “to govern a country and bring peace to all, one must first be able to govern one’s family; to govern one’s family, one must first learn to govern oneself.” The foundation of legitimacy of the historical mission of the Chinese Communist Party and the meaning of its action 13 is the key to understanding China’s system and China’s path, and is also the key of the mind for understanding the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula. The culturally correct methodology of the Chinese revolution is “the Sinicization of Marxism.” The modern history of the West and the history of globalization have made important contributions to the progress of human ideas and institutions, but the hegemonism of the major Western powers and the cultural norms of the Cold War that it has spawned have always been an inextricable threat to globalization and the peaceful development of humankind. The de-globalization and democratic populism in the West are threatening signals. Trumpism was the first of its kind. After Biden took office, the ‘Trump+’ hegemonic model has continued to threaten global peace and development. The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation cannot be a mere revival of Chinese nationalism or a mechanical imitation of the hegemony of Western powers, but instead will inevitably be a new world historical process in which the revival of Chinese culture and the Sinicization of Marxism will give back to and revive globalization. In the future, after the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula is applied to achieve peaceful reunification across the Taiwan Strait, the active participation in this process of Taiwanese people from all walks of life, especially the young, will mean participating not only in the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation but also in human peace and development. This is the fundamental way out for the realization of permanent peace and long-term stability in the Taiwan Strait."

"Exploring Institutional Preparations and Mentality Building for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan Formula","Modern Taiwan Studies , Tian Feilong","Jul 1, 2021","2021 is the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Party, and national rejuvenation has become the main theme of various commemorative activities and ideological discussions. The basic logic of national rejuvenation inevitably includes the complete reunification of the motherland. This explicit logic has long been engraved in the Party’s previous policy documents and included in the preamble of the Constitution. Solving the Taiwan issue and realizing the complete reunification of the motherland is one of the three major historical tasks of the Chinese Communist Party in the 21st century. The Chinese Communist Party, in its political ethics, adheres to the dialectical logic of “Sinicization of Marxism,” organically combines national interests with human interests, and sees that national rejuvenation and a community with a shared future for humankind complement each other. The Taiwan issue is a legacy of China’s civil war, and it is also the result of the complex effects of the hegemony of foreign powers and the Cold War. However, whether it is the unified will of the Chinese people internally or the general trend of world peace and development externally, the resolution of the Taiwan issue is a historical inevitability. In short, if the Taiwan issue is not resolved, China’s national rejuvenation and complete national reunification will be impossible to achieve, China’s modernization process will encounter serious setbacks, internal and external struggles will not end, and peace in the Asia-Pacific region and even the world will lack an orderly basis for stability."
"Exploring Institutional Preparations and Mentality Building for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan Formula","Modern Taiwan Studies , Tian Feilong","Jul 1, 2021","“One Country, Two Systems” is a long-term strategy for the peaceful reunification of the country and the modernization of the system. Its practice in Hong Kong and Macau, especially the experience in Hong Kong, having been through the “Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement” and the country’s remedial legislation, is clearer and more complete. Therefore, it is of more direct and valuable significance as a reference for thinking about and shaping the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula. The particularity of the Taiwan issue cannot be used to oppose and eliminate the applicability of Hong Kong’s experience because Hong Kong’s experience itself is not the result of Hong Kong’s practice in isolation but is instead the result of the dynamic adjustment and comprehensive effect of the central government’s “One Country, Two Systems” strategy, and it still has strong implications for the Taiwan formula. From the original intention of following the “One Country, Two Systems” policy to the continuous improvement of the “One Country, Two Systems” institutional system in practice, the central government’s principles and policies have been consistent and never wavered and, in the new era, continue to promote the positive interaction between theoretical innovation and practical innovation. 14 We expect that under increasingly severe internal and external challenges Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait can reach a consensus on peaceful reunification and negotiate the best model for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula and can create a permanent value consensus and institutional foundation for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and the long-term stability of Taiwanese society."

On the other hand, there is a need to undertake the enormous but most crucial job of mentality building rooted in civilizational foundations and world views. It is only in this way that the ideational obstacles of the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula can be gradually removed, and the institutional process can be substantively launched and steadily implemented. The “One Country, Two Systems” Hong Kong model is creative and advancing with the times, and the exploration of the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula can draw lessons from Hong Kong’s practice.

This forms the scientific guide and the fundamentals to observe for maintaining and shaping national security in the new era. Over the past eight years, under the strong leadership of the CCP Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core and under the guidance of the overall national security outlook, the path of national security with Chinese characteristics has been continuously expanded, and China’s national security has been comprehensively strengthened. The overall national security outlook is a major innovation of our Party regarding national security theory and is of great pioneering significance.

This was a major and joyous event for China’s national security cause on the new journey. It not only brings “timely rain” to further strengthen national security awareness throughout the whole of society but also brings the much needed “easterly wind” to accelerate progress in the development of national security as a primary-level discipline."
Fundamentals to Observe for Maintaining and Shaping National Security in the New Era — Study the Outline for Studying the Overall National Security Outlook,"People's Daily , Yuan Peng","Apr 26, 2022","We need to persevere in studying the overall national security outlook over the long term and firm up self-confidence in the path and consciousness of the strategy in relation to new-era national security work. The direction determines the path, and the path determines the destiny. The path of national security with Chinese characteristics is a concrete embodiment, in national security, of the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. It includes five important features, namely “Five Adheres” (五个坚持). The first is to adhere to the absolute leadership of the Party, improve a centralized, unified, efficient, and authoritative leadership system for national security work, and realize the unity of political security, the people’s security, and national interests as paramount. The Party’s leadership is the most essential feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics and the greatest advantage of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics. National security work must adhere to the Party’s absolute leadership. Political security is fundamental, the people’s security is the purpose, and national interests as paramount is the norm. Adhering to the organic unity of the three is both the ideological essence of the overall national security outlook and also the key to achieving long-term stability. The second is to adhere to safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity and to maintain stability and order in frontiers, borders, and surrounding areas. In relation to “frontiers, borders, and surrounding areas,” or “the three sides,”  “the responsibility is to defend the territory, and every inch of territory must be fought for.” Homeland security has always been a top priority of China’s national security. The third is to adhere to secure development and to promote a dynamic balance between high-quality development and high-level security. The Recommendations of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Formulating the 14th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development and the Long-term Goals for 2035 adopted by the Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee incorporated for the first time the coordination of development and security into the guiding thinking for China’s economic and social development in the period of the 14th Five-Year Plan. It also set out a chapter specifically to make strategic arrangements thereon. This highlighted the important position of national security in the big picture of the work of the Party and the country. The fourth is to adhere to total war, coordinating traditional security with non-traditional security. Faced with the intertwining of and resonance between traditional and non-traditional security risks, and the increasingly fierce competition between major powers and increasingly prominent global challenges, we should implement the overall national security outlook, and focus efforts on “total warfare” thinking, to coordinate responses to traditional and non-traditional security challenges, ensuring that responses to traditional security challenges are more proactive while responses to non-traditional security challenges keep pace with the times. The fifth is to adhere to the path of peaceful development and to promote the coordination of self-security and common security. The external presentation of the national security path with Chinese characteristics is the path of peaceful development. China insists on coordinating its own security and common security, opposes the notion that “a strong nation is bound to seek hegemony,” and is committed to helping the world."

The outlook has strong vitality and unparalleled superiority. 2022 marks the 8th anniversary of the overall national security outlook’s inception.

The brilliant achievements of national security work in the new era are obvious to all. At the same time, in the face of the historic changes in national security in the context of changes unseen in the world in a century, in the face of severe risks and challenges brought about by a period of turbulence and change in the external environment, and in the face of the transformation and upgrading of China’s high-quality economic and social development in the new development stage, we urgently need to strengthen overall national security outlook theoretical literacy and methodological guidance, we urgently need to resolutely follow the path of national security with Chinese characteristics, and we urgently need to effectively coordinate development and security and accelerate the construction of a new security setup that is compatible with the new development setup.

Since late February of this year, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has suddenly erupted, the game between major powers and geopolitical competition has heated up significantly, and the international security environment has become volatile and changeable. Poles apart from the irresponsible faction fostering and flame fueling of the United States and the West, China insists on persuading peace and promoting talks and advocates attaching importance to the reasonable security concerns of all countries. The “global security outlook” has become a high-frequency word in China’s response to current regional hotspots and international crises.

The overall national security outlook adheres to both internal and external cultivation, with the people at the center internally and with the world as its own responsibility externally. It promotes the establishment of a “common, comprehensive, cooperative, and sustainable” “global security outlook”; what it seeks is not only the security of China but the peaceful coexistence of all countries and the safety of all. The “global security outlook” will help to solve the so-called “security dilemma” of Western international security theory because it abandons the zero-sum thinking and the hegemonic mentality of “if you lose, I win” and promotes the inclusive wisdom of win-win cooperation and the equality of universal security. China is consistent in its words and deeds and has always advocated the peaceful settlement of international disputes. China has promoted the building of a new type of international relations featuring win-win cooperation and a universally secure community with a shared future for all of humankind.

This will then promote the synergy and efficiency of multilateral development cooperation processes and accelerate the implementation of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In recent years, the world as a whole has become intertwined with wars and crises, such as economic downturns, geopolitical turmoil, clashes of civilizations, and the spread of the pandemic, all of which have become superimposed upon one another.

The goal must be to continuously enhance the people’s sense of happiness, gain, and security and to realize the all-round development of mankind. The concept of primacy of people in development solves the fundamental problem of “for whom,” which not only embodies the basic principles of Marxist historical materialism about the creation of history by the masses and also demonstrates the traditional Chinese political philosophy that “the essence of governance is livelihood; and the essence of livelihood is adequacy.” General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out: Development for the sake of the people makes development meaningful. Only when development depends on the people will development gain momentum.

Efforts should also be made to solve the problem of unbalanced and insufficient development among and within countries. In the face of the crisis, mankind must help one another, coexist in harmony, and move forward in the direction of building a community with a shared future for mankind. Emphasis on inclusiveness is not the substitution of one system for another, nor the substitution of one civilization for another, but rather the fact that countries with different social systems, different ideologies, different histories and cultures, and different levels of development are all involved in international affairs.

Global Development Initiative Provides a Blueprint for Responding to World Changes,"Red Flag Manuscript , Yao Yao","Feb 25, 2022","Since the Global Development Initiative was proposed, it has garnered a strong response from the international community. So far, dozens of countries and many international organizations have made clear statements, not only have developing countries actively supported and echoed the initiative, but many developed countries also welcome it and agree with the ideas and areas of cooperation proposed by the initiative. All parties generally believe that this major initiative will help garner global synergy, and the core concepts and specific measures it embodies demonstrate China’s moral strength and key role in today’s world. They are willing to carry out exchanges and cooperation with China to jointly promote the implementation of the initiative. UN Secretary-General António Guterres spoke highly of the Global Development Initiative, believing that it is of great positive significance for promoting global equality and balanced and sustainable development, expressing that the United Nations fully supports the initiative and is willing to strengthen cooperation with China in this regard."

Global Security Initiative: China’s Answer to Challenges,"China Foundation for International Studies , Fu Mengzi","Sep 6, 2022","The world is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century. The change of the century, changes in the world, and changes in history are unfolding on different levels. The COVID-19 pandemic sweeping the world has accelerated these changes in breadth and depth. The Ukraine crisis triggered the traditional symptoms of great power conflict and has become the most recent manifestation of these changes. The free, open, cooperative, and prosperous world we have witnessed for nearly four decades seems to be fading away. Everything we are familiar with is subject to inevitable change, or we could say everything seems to suddenly jump into another picture, where the challenges facing humanity are presented as never before. Any single variable, whether the COVID-19 pandemic or the Ukrainian crisis, is only a new variable in the great changes unseen in a century. It is neither decisive nor the great change itself. These new variables have their own influence, but the superimposed influence of all these variables is far more profound and far-reaching, so much so that it poses a challenge to global security and global development."
Global Security Initiative: China’s Answer to Challenges,"China Foundation for International Studies , Fu Mengzi","Sep 6, 2022","First, the blocs and camps in world politics are becoming increasingly clear. At least at the level of major powers, the confrontational situation between the United States and the West and non-Western countries has already been revealed. This situation is less due to changes in world power, particularly the rise of China, than a result of the inherent thinking patterns of the West. The United States and the West insist on embroiling China and Russia, viewing them as “strategic competitors” and “revisionist countries.” Competition has replaced cooperation, and containment has replaced coordination. Although the situation is not completely hostile in nature, the confrontational tone is very clear and prominent. Although the practice is “cooperate when we should cooperate and confront when we should confront” (该合作的合作, 该对抗的对抗), the confrontation is comprehensive and in all areas, signaling a parting of the ways. The West came together to impose sanctions on Russia and expelled it from the SWIFT system. They are preparing digital trade agreements and Internet protocols that cover the Indo-Pacific region but exclude China and promoting a new Asia-Pacific economic framework that excludes China and Russia. Europe, Japan, South Korea, and Australia show an obvious penchant for grouping with the United States. The Democratic coalition roped together by the Biden administration may also become a normalized international platform, the goals of the “Indo-Pacific Strategy” are becoming further focused, and expansion may go further."
Global Security Initiative: China’s Answer to Challenges,"China Foundation for International Studies , Fu Mengzi","Sep 6, 2022","Second, the international power landscape has not changed, but the trend of the rise of the East and the decline of the West has slowed down. The current situation where the West is strong and the East is weak is hard to completely change in the short term. In the nearly 40 years from 1980 to 2018, the U.S. share of world GDP remained at around 25%. It could rise to around 32% in individual years such as 2000, but its overall share of the world’s GDP remained basically unchanged. Moreover, the gap between the United States and major powers such as Europe, Japan, and Russia is widening. Only China has narrowed its gap in economic size compared to the United States. The United States recently revised its statistical rules to include spending such as personal residential investment in its GDP, instantly increasing it by USD 1.5 trillion (equivalent to an economy close to the size of Russia). Emerging markets experienced a moment of collective rise, but their growth rates have slowed down in recent years. Since 2015, the size of the Russian economy under sanctions has shrunk further and the economies of South Africa and Brazil have declined sharply. The Russian economy may further contract this year and next, and China’s economic growth has slowed down. Only India is in relatively good condition. Since the global economic downturn in recent years is different from any previous one, and the COVID-19 pandemic has hindered the flow of factors, even if a stimulus policy is adopted, its effect is greatly reduced due to the constraints faced in its implementation. Moreover, the global spread of the pandemic has caused all countries to fall into a decline at the same time, so we lack the force of the rise of emerging economies that powered the recovery after the 2008 financial crisis. This outcome will slow down any potential changes to the global power landscape. Accounting for more than half of the global GDP calculated by market exchange rates, the West can maintain its dominant position in the global economy for some time."
Global Security Initiative: China’s Answer to Challenges,"China Foundation for International Studies , Fu Mengzi","Sep 6, 2022","Third, the foundation of the international order has been shaken and the global governance deficit has increased, leaving serious vacancies. The United Nations sees the maintenance of world peace and development as its mission, but in terms of security, it cannot stop conflicts or even wars launched by major powers, and it is even more difficult for it to eliminate the root causes of wars. Over the years, the United Nations has failed to constrain the drive of hegemons to start wars and could not prevent the crisis in Ukraine. In addition, while investigating the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic, the United Nations was subject to occasional coercion from hegemonic countries. In the face of increasing global challenges, it is hard for the UN to gather a consensus, its decision-making efficiency is low, and differences have become more pronounced in the context of the Ukraine crisis. The lack of progress in the reform of the United Nations itself and the further weakening of political trust among major powers have cast a shadow over the prospect of the United Nations’ ability to jointly address challenges to humanity. On the issue of development, the trade war has damaged the foundation of symbiosis and mutual benefit among countries, and the formation of cliquish “small circles” (小圈子) has hindered policies for the international flow of factors of production and arrangement for the international economic, trade, and financial order."
Global Security Initiative: China’s Answer to Challenges,"China Foundation for International Studies , Fu Mengzi","Sep 6, 2022","Finally, globalization has receded, liberalism has retreated, power politics have returned, and the global security situation has become more severe. Driven by globalization, decades of global development and prosperity have been achieved, and late-developing countries have seized the opportunity to develop and rise, relatively “eroding” the advantages of the West. Industrial outsourcing, wealth polarization, class antagonism, and other factors have provoked a wave of populism across Europe and North America, and anti-globalization, xenophobia, nationalism, unilateralism, and the supremacy of national interests have re-emerged. The “you lose, I win” zero-sum thinking and the “the strong eat the weak” law of the jungle are increasingly exposed. Liberalism has been replaced by realism, and this has even become the basic political demand in Western countries."
Global Security Initiative: China’s Answer to Challenges,"China Foundation for International Studies , Fu Mengzi","Sep 6, 2022","Under the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, the economies of various countries have further declined, and the economic expectations of the world and different countries have been repeatedly lowered. In addition, under the influence of the retreat of globalization, the difficult economic situation cannot be completely improved in the short term and the lives of people in all countries have become more difficult. The influence of the economic downturn has extended to the political and social fields, which means it is more likely that economic conflicts will evolve into social and political conflicts, or may even rise to the level of political conflicts. In all countries, the space for compromise with other countries will be further narrowed, and there will be a larger market for hard-line tendencies. Provocation and counter-provocation, repression and counter-repression, isolation and counter-isolation, sanctions and countersanctions, and deterrence and counter-deterrence between countries are being gradually manifested at different levels. Hegemonic countries adjust their military strategies, expand their military alliances, and strengthen their military machinery against other major powers, NATO may further encroach on areas outside its traditional regions, and the politicization and securitization of everything is ubiquitous. These trends all show that, given the prevalence of power politics, it is impossible to have a world with secure borders. It was once thought that war between major powers was unimaginable, but no major power has ever committed to renouncing the use of force. Moreover, with individual major powers using force to threaten or even invade other countries, history is repeating itself. Whether in the era of liberalism or in the era of realism, the threat of war never retreated, and various types of games that countries can engage in such as cyber warfare, financial warfare, trade warfare, and public opinion warfare have also intensified."

Global Security Initiative: China’s Answer to Challenges,"China Foundation for International Studies , Fu Mengzi","Sep 6, 2022","On July 6, 2021, President Xi Jinping, in his keynote speech at the CCP and World Political Party Summit, stated: “Today, human society is once again at a crossroads in history. Will it be hostile confrontation or mutual respect? Will it be closed-off decoupling or open cooperation? Will it be zero-sum games or mutual benefit? This choice rests on our shoulders.” At a moment when human security is at stake, President Xi Jinping delivered a keynote speech at this year’s Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference. In order to promote the common security of the world, he systematically proposed a global security initiative with the “Six Commitments, ” such as “staying committed to the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative, and sustainable security and jointly maintaining world peace and security,” as the main points. This is a brand-new initiative presented to the world following the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind and the Global Development Initiative. It is also a targeted initiative proposed under the conditions of complex changes in the international situation and the overlapping of various security challenges. It is related to the future stability, peace, and development of the world and demonstrates the feelings for humanity, global responsibility, and international responsibility of a rising power."
Global Security Initiative: China’s Answer to Challenges,"China Foundation for International Studies , Fu Mengzi","Sep 6, 2022","The international situation is in a time of turmoil, and the implementation of the Global Security Initiative is even more urgent and imperative. China is vigorously advocating the Global Security Initiative and promoting its better implementation at the global level. It must maintain sufficient strategic clear-headedness, be familiar with and master unusual international exchanges and ways of doing things, and calmly respond to a variety of increasingly complex challenges."
Global Security Initiative: China’s Answer to Challenges,"China Foundation for International Studies , Fu Mengzi","Sep 6, 2022","First, we must maintain the independence of national image and policies. Since its founding, New China has been respected by the world as a major power. This is because it is a major power that takes an independent stand and can play a special role in international affairs. At a time when some major powers are seeing a rise in the tendencies of unilateralism, selfishness, profit-seeking, and nationalism, China has risen in the world as an independent force. First, as a powerful force for peace and development, it is even more valuable and important. If China’s strength grows by one point, the forces of peace will increase by one point, and the impetus for development will also increase by one point. We need to develop regional or international multilateral mechanisms that consolidate cooperation, openness, inclusivity, reciprocity, and mutual support and fly the flag of unequivocal opposition to group politics as our basic stance in the face of a world being divided into blocs and camps. China does not conform to, avoid, or worry about confrontational competition. We insist on strategic confidence and face up to the unavoidable competitive nature among countries. At the same time, we seek to engage in constructive exchanges with the United States and Western countries as far as possible. In the face of confrontational political or military “small circles,” we must make efforts to develop and deepen cooperation in areas of overlapping interests."
Global Security Initiative: China’s Answer to Challenges,"China Foundation for International Studies , Fu Mengzi","Sep 6, 2022","Second, we must coordinate development and security. The future international economic environment may be very different from that of the past. Globalization is retreating, the risk of geopolitical games is rising, there is a significant trend of some countries “decoupling” and “breaking ties” with China, and the COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound and far-reaching impact on the global economy. While saying goodbye to the era of surging globalization, we must correctly deal with the aftermath and eliminate the problems it leaves behind, while simultaneously striving to promote a new type of globalization. We must continue to advocate multilateralism, jointly promote cooperation in global development, and prevent the economic difficulties of developing countries from becoming social and security issues. Development is the premise, but security is the guarantee. Without security, development is nullified. Therefore, we must seek secure development, closely intertwine development and security, strengthen risk awareness and bottom-line thinking, actively anticipate risks, and strive to resolve them."
Global Security Initiative: China’s Answer to Challenges,"China Foundation for International Studies , Fu Mengzi","Sep 6, 2022","Third, we must give priority to operations in neighboring countries [周边] and make strategic spatial reliance stronger and more robust. From the perspective of industrial chain security, although the unlimited extension of the industrial chain can dilute production costs, this makes it difficult to resolve the dangers related to industrial security and even national security. Therefore, neighboring countries should become an important area for chain supplementing and chain building. We must truly make our neighboring countries the outer edge of the internal circulation and the frontier of external circulation. In the process of unifying the large domestic market, we must strive to align with neighboring countries, expand imports from neighboring countries, increase investment in neighboring countries, and enhance the radiation of China’s geo-economic influence. We must allow the fruits of China’s economic growth to benefit neighboring countries in a more in-depth, numerous, and wide-ranging manner and promote the building of a community with a shared future for neighboring countries."

"Grasping the Basis of Journalism ——Xi Jinping, Secretary of Fujian Ningde Prefectural Party Committee, Talks about Journalism","Chinese Journalist , Xi Jinping","Jul 30, 1989","Xi Jinping believes that at present, it is necessary to further strengthen the understanding of the status and role of journalism and to further strengthen the Party’s leadership over journalism. Raising awareness and strengthening leadership must be carried out in light of the current situation. Journalism must grasp the pulse of the times and recognize the tasks and responsibilities entrusted to us by the current situation. The achievements of the ten-year reform are enormous, but it also faces many difficulties and problems. On the one hand, journalism cannot be conservative, ignoring reform with deaf ears to every voice. On the other hand, you cannot copy what others say. At present, there are various social trends of thought. We should think calmly through our own minds and not be dominated by the ephemeral. It takes time to calmly analyze and judge affairs, and rushing to make judgments often leads to a one-sided or even wrong conclusion. Judging from some of the problems currently reflected, it does seem necessary to speed up the process of democracy and the construction of the legal system. As for how to accelerate and to what extent, there are certain scientific implications. Otherwise, democracy will be absolutized, premature, and separated from the current stage. In that case, what was originally very reasonable may become a very wrong thing."
"Grasping the Basis of Journalism ——Xi Jinping, Secretary of Fujian Ningde Prefectural Party Committee, Talks about Journalism","Chinese Journalist , Xi Jinping","Jul 30, 1989","What is democracy? Democracy cannot be defined in general terms. Democracy in a socialist country, I personally understand, should be a legal embodiment of the interests of the people. It is not the will of a certain class or certain people or any of the demands of any one class. Demanding extremes from others or the country is in itself a demand of others to be democratic to oneself while one does not have any sense of accountability or responsibility. This is unacceptable."
"Grasping the Basis of Journalism ——Xi Jinping, Secretary of Fujian Ningde Prefectural Party Committee, Talks about Journalism","Chinese Journalist , Xi Jinping","Jul 30, 1989","Just imagine, if people can do whatever they want, deciding not to engage in family planning and foregoing the task of requisitioning, would this work? Therefore, democracy itself cannot be absolute. It must have certain constraints. At the same time, democratic requirements are also phased and cannot be premature. We now have a phased approach to the cultivation of democratic qualities and the training of democracy. This is the current state of democracy. Can it be used maturely? Let us discuss the election of village committees. Discuss this use of democracy. Some places have done well, knowing how to plan well for the family with the ability to serve the fundamental interests of the village people. In some places, good clan elders are chosen. This has resulted in a paralyzed and semi-paralyzed state in rural grassroots organizations. Therefore, when we ask any question, we should not abandon its premise, background, or certain conditions. Otherwise, it will be difficult to even discuss such things. Is the Cultural Revolution not a specimen of the Great Democracy? This kind of “great democracy” is not instilled with science or the legal system, but rather with superstition and ignorance, and the result was a great turmoil. Anyone can organize a few people to raid their homes, and anyone can band together a fighting team. Today, you defeat me, and tomorrow, I defeat you. Can such hard times be repeated? Without stability and unity, nothing would be possible. The problem of democracy can only be solved on the track of the legal system."
"Grasping the Basis of Journalism ——Xi Jinping, Secretary of Fujian Ningde Prefectural Party Committee, Talks about Journalism","Chinese Journalist , Xi Jinping","Jul 30, 1989","There is also the issue of corruption, which is the most likely to stir righteous indignation. It should be said that every honest journalist and every person with a conscience speaks volumes about corruption and righteous indignation. This issue, however, has to be dealt with calmly. Now, we must not merely rage against corruption. Rather, we must reach a practical solution to corruption. Some criticize corruption, while simultaneously enjoying certain privileges. It can be seen that, from delivery to cremation, transactions may occur at every stage of life, and there may be unhealthy trends. What power can we give to our stethoscope for corruption? However, even it can also generate transactions, as can the steering wheel. This problem deserves our deep thought, and it is worth our in-depth analysis to explore the reasons and reach an effective solution. Otherwise, the problem becomes oversimplified."
"Grasping the Basis of Journalism ——Xi Jinping, Secretary of Fujian Ningde Prefectural Party Committee, Talks about Journalism","Chinese Journalist , Xi Jinping","Jul 30, 1989","To grasp the pulse of the times and understand the role of news, we must realize that news is the mouthpiece of the Party and the people, and it is responsible for the important task of reflecting and guiding public opinion. Our Party has always had a tradition of using newspapers, radio, television, and other propaganda tools to publicize the Party’s line, principles, and policies, to educate the people, to reflect the people’s voice, to promote righteousness, to expose negative and corrupt phenomena, and to mobilize and organize the masses to participate in the socialist construction cause. The Party spirit we emphasize contains the profound connotation of the people’s very nature. Journalists must not only publicize the Party’s propositions but also fully reflect the people’s wishes and demands, so as to unify the two. As a science, journalism is closely related to politics. However, it does not mean that news can be equated with politics, and it does not mean that its authenticity can be ignored for political needs. Therefore, it is necessary to emphasize the Party nature of news work, but not to ignore the regularity of news work itself."
"Grasping the Basis of Journalism ——Xi Jinping, Secretary of Fujian Ningde Prefectural Party Committee, Talks about Journalism","Chinese Journalist , Xi Jinping","Jul 30, 1989","At present, China’s reform is in a critical period. The mentality of the people is diverse, and there is constant friction among the various interests. As for how to solve these problems, a very important point is to give full play to the role of the news media in propagating reform and propagating the Party’s policies. Reform is a great social practice, and the news media must timely and accurately convey the Party and government’s principles, policies, and various information in the process of implementation, prompting Party organizations and governments at all levels to correct deviations in a timely manner such that the reform will be more direct and spur healthier growth. As for some vague awarenesses that exist in the masses, news media should be guided to alleviate conflicts in communication between the Party, the government, and the people and in ideological understandings between people in different regions. We must improve people’s understanding and support for reform and guide people’s thoughts and actions to “One Center, Two Basic Points” so as to guide to the great historical mission of “realizing the four modernizations and revitalizing China.” It should be affirmed that journalism has written a glorious page in the ten-year reform, made great contributions to the reform and opening up, and made great efforts as an important part of the Party’s development of political advantages. Being good at using news tools to promote work is actually a manifestation of leadership and modern working methods. The connection between leaders and the people comes in nothing more than two forms: One is mystical, and the other is open. Mystification is often associated with feudalism, closure, and economic backwardness; openness is often associated with a high degree of civilizational progress. Party organizations at all levels in our region should attach great importance to news work and effectively strengthen their leadership over news work."

"Grasping the Basis of Journalism ——Xi Jinping, Secretary of Fujian Ningde Prefectural Party Committee, Talks about Journalism","Chinese Journalist , Xi Jinping","Jul 30, 1989",Do a good job in the guidance of public opinion and carry forward the righteousness of the society
"Grasping the Basis of Journalism ——Xi Jinping, Secretary of Fujian Ningde Prefectural Party Committee, Talks about Journalism","Chinese Journalist , Xi Jinping","Jul 30, 1989","Public opinion guidance and public opinion supervision are the two major functions of socialist journalism. The guidance of public opinion is to promote social integrity through news reports. As for the “promoting righteousness” that I speak of, this refers to strengthening people’s confidence in reform through the guidance of public opinion, recognizing the bright future of reform, and adhering to the four basic principles. At present, it is especially necessary to encourage everyone to actively participate in the work of governance, rectification, and reform in accordance with the spiritual requirements of the Central Committee, to maintain the authority of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and to maintain a stable and united political situation. How can the guidance of public opinion play the role of “promoting righteousness?” This requires every journalist to stick to positive propaganda and grasp the tone of news propaganda. In the previous period, there was such a saying: “Unspoken achievements carry no weight.” This statement is obviously one-sided. China’s ten-year reform has made great achievements, which is the mainstream of our work and is recognized by the world. News and propaganda must be truth-seeking, must publicize achievements confidently, and must enhance the cohesion of the Party and the authority of the government. Journalists should pay attention to these issues, grasp the essence of things, reflect the mainstream take of the issues, and play a role in promoting righteousness. Regarding the hot and difficult issues that the masses are concerned about, we should, on the premise of publicizing the achievements of the ten-year reform, clarify the nature of these issues to the masses and guide the masses to correctly understand that these issues arise when the democratic and legal system is not perfect during the transition between the old and the new systems. Such issues will be reduced and eliminated with the gradual deepening of China’s reform, the construction of a socialist spiritual civilization, and the continuous strengthening of democracy and legal system construction."
"Grasping the Basis of Journalism ——Xi Jinping, Secretary of Fujian Ningde Prefectural Party Committee, Talks about Journalism","Chinese Journalist , Xi Jinping","Jul 30, 1989","While strengthening the work of public opinion guidance, we must also pay attention to the role of public opinion supervision. Public opinion supervision is a key aspect of the strengthening of Party building and democratic political construction. Unchecked and unsupervised power is bound to lead to corruption. Whether corruption can be effectively stopped is related to the life and death of the Party and the success or failure of the socialist cause. This requires the establishment of various effective supervision mechanisms; public opinion supervision of the news media is the most frequent, open, and extensive method of supervision. At present, when emphasizing the strengthening of Party building and opposing corruption, we must give full play to the public opinion supervision function of news so that corruption can be exposed in broad daylight. Party organizations and governments at all levels should welcome journalists that report both good and bad news, take up the weapon of public opinion supervision, and expose and criticize problems in their own work and various corruption phenomena. Party and government leaders at all levels must correctly deal with news supervision, establish an open and enlightened attitude, not demand perfection from reporters, make friends with journalists, regard news supervision as support for local work, and create a good political environment for news supervision."
"Grasping the Basis of Journalism ——Xi Jinping, Secretary of Fujian Ningde Prefectural Party Committee, Talks about Journalism","Chinese Journalist , Xi Jinping","Jul 30, 1989","Using the weapon of public opinion supervision requires a strong sense of social responsibility and attention to social effects: It is conducive to maintaining a stable and united political situation, reform and opening up, and the Party’s work. The starting point of public opinion supervision should be positive and constructive, and the focus of supervision should be those that seriously violate the major policies of the Party and the state and major problems in social life, with a focus on common incidents. The facts revealed must be accurate. When it comes to criticism of first-level Party organizations and governments, we must be cautious and not jump to conclusions. It is necessary to conduct in-depth investigations, listen to opinions from multiple parties, and draw conclusions that are in line with the facts. In particular, we must pay attention not to criticize those problems that the masses have opinions on and which are temporarily difficult to solve due to limited conditions in our work. Let the people know that the Party and the government are taking measures to overcome difficulties to solve these problems."

It is the Party’s fine tradition to be deeply practical, to investigate, and to conduct research, and it is also the work style that journalists must have. Whether a report is well written or not has a lot to do with whether journalists can go deep into reality and conduct in-depth interviews. Judging from the situation in our region, at present, some journalists do not conduct enough research. They sit in the office to think of ideas and rely on briefings and conference materials to compile manuscripts. There are not many relevant reports in the newspapers that have in-depth content or a high level of quality; in particular, there are many good topics that go unreported, which has a lot to do with the lack of an in-depth understanding of reality. Investigation and research are the basic skills of journalists and the fundamental way for journalists to become talents.

"How Can We Achieve New Stability on the Taiwan Issue—Dialogue, Crisis, or War?","China Foundation for International Studies , Da Wei","Aug 22, 2022","Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan raises a very important question: Will China and the United States seek new stability on the Taiwan issue through dialogue, crisis, or military conflict? At present, China and the United States need to reach a new strategic understanding in a new environment. This idea is reasonable, but it is being put to the test. This situation has left us with little time. If we cannot achieve strategic stability through self-restraint and mutual assurance, we may have to wait for stability to be achieved through a larger crisis, conflict, or even war. However, this path would be extremely costly for China, the United States, and the world."
"How Can We Achieve New Stability on the Taiwan Issue—Dialogue, Crisis, or War?","China Foundation for International Studies , Da Wei","Aug 22, 2022","Over the past 50 years, the Taiwan issue has constantly been the most important and sensitive issue in Sino-U.S. relations. Over the past few years, many observers have come to believe that China and the United States have fallen into a vicious circle of action and retaliation on the Taiwan issue, making the Taiwan Strait the only area with the potential to lead to a conscious conflict or war between China and the United States. Although she was aware of the danger of the Taiwan issue, Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, still insisted on visiting Taiwan on August 2, causing the latest round of tensions between China and the United States."
"How Can We Achieve New Stability on the Taiwan Issue—Dialogue, Crisis, or War?","China Foundation for International Studies , Da Wei","Aug 22, 2022","The Chinese government and scholars have harshly criticized and appropriately countered Pelosi’s mistake. Due to the appropriate and restrained countermeasures taken by the Chinese government, the worst-case scenario people had envisioned before Pelosi’s visit did not materialize. However, the waves in the “Strait of Fear” (恐怖海峡) are far from subsiding, and “crisis stabilization” has not yet been achieved. The Taiwan issue is dragging Sino-U.S. relations down the slope to a more serious conflict, and at the moment, we are hard-pressed to find the strength to stop this slide. Relative to the next few weeks, the situation could become even worse in the next few months or years. Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan raises a very important question: Will China and the United States seek new stability on the Taiwan issue through dialogue, crisis, or military conflict?"
"How Can We Achieve New Stability on the Taiwan Issue—Dialogue, Crisis, or War?","China Foundation for International Studies , Da Wei","Aug 22, 2022","For a long time, the Chinese and the U.S. governments have criticized each other for “salami slicing” on the Taiwan issue, and both claimed that their actions were reactive actions of last resort. Both sides can make their own arguments, and in this game, it is indeed difficult to distinguish between the “chicken” and the “egg.” Due to a lack of mutual trust, even unintentional actions by one side can be perceived by the other as deliberate provocations, to say nothing of conscious policy adjustments. Neither Chinese nor American policymakers want a military conflict or even a war to break out over the Taiwan issue, but we need to be soberly aware that it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain the relative stability of the Taiwan issue as in the past because some of the long-term fundamentals underlying the Taiwan issue have changed."
"How Can We Achieve New Stability on the Taiwan Issue—Dialogue, Crisis, or War?","China Foundation for International Studies , Da Wei","Aug 22, 2022","The biggest change is the change in Sino-U.S. relations. Five or six years ago, when Sino-U.S. relations were generally stable, U.S. policymakers were more inclined to restrain their support for the Taiwan authorities to avoid overly aggravating Beijing. After the deterioration of Sino-U.S. relations, the U.S. administration and Congress are unwilling to exercise restraint on the Taiwan issue for the sake of Sino-U.S. relations. Instead, they hope to doubly “compensate” the Taiwan authorities through their actions and even challenge and anger the Chinese government by supporting the Taiwan authorities. This is the psychological root of the “salami slicing” strategy we have seen over the past few years by the United States."
"How Can We Achieve New Stability on the Taiwan Issue—Dialogue, Crisis, or War?","China Foundation for International Studies , Da Wei","Aug 22, 2022","Similarly, when Sino-U.S. relations were still good, the Chinese government did not want the Taiwan issue to undermine the overall situation in Sino-U.S. relations, and it also tried to maintain a relatively restrained attitude towards some U.S. practices. For example, Newt Gingrich, then the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, also visited Taiwan 25 years ago, an action that the Chinese government opposed at the time. However, at that time, Sino-U.S. relations were moving towards a “constructive partnership,” and Gingrich’s visit was an “interlude” in the process of improving China-U.S. relations, so China did not respond as strongly as today. Now, Sino-U.S. relations have undergone a qualitative change. When China responds to the provocative actions of the United States, the degree of scruples China has concerning the overall stability of Sino-U.S. relations has naturally declined."

Due to the lack of mutual trust between China and the United States, when mainland China is increasingly capable of achieving the goal of national unity through military action, the United States will be worried and try to help the Taiwan authorities improve their capabilities to confront the mainland even if China does nothing. At the same time, after China’s ability to act is improved, the patience of the majority of the Chinese people with regard to certain U.S. politicians and the Taiwan independence forces on the island of Taiwan will naturally and gradually decline."

After the 1970s, Sino-U.S. relations improved, and the United States gradually came to accept China’s three conditions on the Taiwan issue of severing diplomatic relations, abolishing its treaty, and withdrawing troops. Since the 1990s, Sino-U.S. relations became increasingly complex and in-depth, and the United States began to move towards the so-called “two-way containment” (双向遏制) on the Taiwan issue. On the one hand, it put pressure on the mainland so that it could not use force, and on the other hand, it opposed the rash actions of Taiwan independence forces."

In fact, while mainland China adheres to its long-term strategy of peaceful reunification, its specific policy formats and priorities are constantly changing."
"How Can We Achieve New Stability on the Taiwan Issue—Dialogue, Crisis, or War?","China Foundation for International Studies , Da Wei","Aug 22, 2022","When discussing the Taiwan issue, we often use the concept of “red lines.” “Red lines” are bottom lines that cannot be crossed. In a strategic game, clear “red lines” for all parties in the game are a necessary prerequisite for avoiding major crises. However, at least on the Taiwan issue, the “red lines” have never been clearly defined “lines,” but more like a “region.” Rather than saying that each party has a “red line,” it would be better to say that each party insists on a “red zone” with blurred boundaries and a certain degree of flexibility."
"How Can We Achieve New Stability on the Taiwan Issue—Dialogue, Crisis, or War?","China Foundation for International Studies , Da Wei","Aug 22, 2022","For example, from the perspective of the Chinese, the United States has been hollowing out its “One China Policy” in recent years, and constantly “slicing salami” through legislation, visits, arms sales, and other means. The United States still claims that it adheres to the “One China Policy” and that actions including Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan do not violate the “One China Policy.” The “One China Policy” is like a temple, which consists of the building itself and the Buddha statues in it. In the past, the United States maintained a series of self-imposed restrictions on its interactions with Taiwan in relation to the “One China Policy” to ensure that such exchanges were in keeping with the nature of “unofficial relations.”"

It is as if the United States removed the Buddha statues from the temple, leaving only an empty structure, and then claimed that the temple was still there. It seems that as long as the United States does not say it “supports Taiwan independence,” nothing else it does will violate its “One China Policy.” In fact, the United States has been continuously trampling on China’s “red zone,” causing anger and anxiety on the part of China, but claiming that it has not crossed China’s bottom line. At the same time, viewed from another perspective, despite the Chinese government’s constant reaffirmation of its basic policies of “peaceful reunification and one country, two systems,” as long as the capabilities of the Chinese military are growing, and the scope of its activities is expanding, the United States will believe that China is gradually abandoning its policy of “peaceful reunification.”"

Today, to stabilize the situation in the Taiwan Strait, we must achieve a new balance in the new environment.

This line of thought is reasonable. The challenge is that, on the one hand, it remains to be seen whether Chinese and U.S. policymakers can withstand the strong domestic forces generated by the deterioration of Sino-U.S. relations that are pulling on them. On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether China and the United States can sit down and have a really in-depth discussion to ensure that each other can send restraint signals that can be accurately grasped by the other side. Both points are undoubtedly extremely difficult, and this situation has left us with little time. If we cannot achieve strategic stability through self-restraint and mutual assurance, we may have to wait for stability to be achieved through a larger crisis, conflict, or even war.

How to View Russia’s Ejection From SWIFT,"Sina News , Wang Yongli","Feb 28, 2022","SWIFT is currently the most important global payment instruction messaging system, but it is not the case that without SWIFT cross-border economic transactions absolutely cannot be carried out. The disconnection of services by SWIFT is itself not a fundamental issue. The real concern is the possible impact that could be generated by the U.S.-European camp implementing severe economic sanctions or even fully decoupling."
How to View Russia’s Ejection From SWIFT,"Sina News , Wang Yongli","Feb 28, 2022","On February 26 (U.S. time), the White House issued a joint statement by the leaders of the European Union, the United States, and Canada on their decision to ensure the removal of selected Russian banks from the SWIFT information system. (Note that this was not the removal of all Russian banks registered with SWIFT). This has been interpreted by many as: The United States and Europe have used a “financial nuclear bomb,” a “financial killer” that will shut down Russia’s foreign trade and international financial transactions, causing a devastating blow to Russia’s economic development and social stability."
How to View Russia’s Ejection From SWIFT,"Sina News , Wang Yongli","Feb 28, 2022",This still needs to be scrutinized carefully.
How to View Russia’s Ejection From SWIFT,"Sina News , Wang Yongli","Feb 28, 2022","First, it should be clear that SWIFT is only a part of the international payment settlement system, not all of it"
How to View Russia’s Ejection From SWIFT,"Sina News , Wang Yongli","Feb 28, 2022","The components of the international payment settlement system include settlement currency selection, payment instruction messaging systems, settlement funds account systems, and the actual processing of payment settlement. SWIFT is only one of the payment instruction messaging systems."
How to View Russia’s Ejection From SWIFT,"Sina News , Wang Yongli","Feb 28, 2022","Settlement currency selection: When economic transactions occur between countries with different currencies, it is necessary to first determine the currency of denomination and settlement for the economic transactions. This may be the currency of the party in the economic transaction with the stronger voice, or it may be another country’s currency that is more internationalized. It is through an extensive global selection process that the relative shares or statuses of different countries’ currencies in international payments and foreign exchange reserves are formed. Behind this selection is a comparison of the overall national power and international influence of different countries, and only the currency of the country with the strongest international influence can become the most dominant international currency (international hard currency). At present, the dollar is the number one international currency. Its share of international payments is around 40%, and its share in international foreign exchange reserves is around 60%. The euro ranks second. Its share of international payments is close to 40%, and its share in international foreign exchange reserves is around 25%. Other national currencies lag far behind the dollar and euro."
How to View Russia’s Ejection From SWIFT,"Sina News , Wang Yongli","Feb 28, 2022","Payment instruction messaging system: When economic transactions between countries occur, it is necessary for the payer to issue a payment instruction to its clearing institution (a bank in which it has an account). The clearing institution then deducts the payment accordingly and transfers it to the recipient’s account at the recipient’s bank, or reduces its own deposit in the recipient’s bank and issues a payment notice to the recipient’s bank. After the recipient’s bank receives the instruction, it registers an increase of its own deposit in the payer’s bank or a reduction of the payer’s deposit in its own bank, at the same time transferring the amount to the account of the recipient, and sends a notice of receipt of payment to the recipient. So, to realize cross-border settlement, it is necessary to connect the payment instruction message specification and processing systems of each country. Since different countries have different languages, different legal systems, and different time standards, it would be very troublesome and uneconomical if each country were to establish independent payment instruction messaging systems with other countries, and the high cost and low efficiency of doing so might even hinder the development of mutual economic transactions. At present, SWIFT is the most widely used payment instruction messaging system in the world."
How to View Russia’s Ejection From SWIFT,"Sina News , Wang Yongli","Feb 28, 2022","Payment funds account system: International payment settlement involves the opening of funds accounts at clearing institutions and having sufficient balance of funds (including overdraft limit) to ensure the funds needed to settle payment. Because international payment settlement may involve multiple international currencies, clearing institutions are required to open many settlement accounts in banks of many countries and strengthen the management of settlement account funds (positions). Since international payment settlement involves different currencies, languages, etc., it is far more complex than domestic settlement in a single domestic currency and language. In order to prevent international payment settlement from negatively affecting their domestic settlement systems, many countries have established a relatively independent international payment settlement account system, forming a risk isolation wall while maintaining certain financial links with the domestic payment settlement system. For example, within the United States there is the Fedwire U.S. dollar system, whereas the cross-border system is CHIPS. Within China there is the High-Value Payment System (HVPS) for real-time settlement in renminbi (RMB), whereas for cross-border settlement there is the Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS). The payment settlement account system in each country has strong sovereignty attributes and needs to be subject to close supervision by the country where it is located. Worldwide, the final payment settlement account for a country’s currency is in the country whose currency it is (the final payment settlement account for the U.S. dollar is CHIPS, the final payment settlement account for the RMB is CIPS, and so on) because the supply of a currency is ultimately controlled by the country that issues it."
How to View Russia’s Ejection From SWIFT,"Sina News , Wang Yongli","Feb 28, 2022","It needs to be clarified that systems such as CHIPS and CIPS are first and foremost funds account systems. They are primarily for the currencies of their respective countries, and what they mainly resolve are the “flows of funds” of international settlements. This is not the same as being able to completely replace the payment instruction messaging system. They basically have to connect with SWIFT in order to complete international payment settlement business. SWIFT is a payment instruction messaging system. SWIFT itself does not involve the funds accounts of member units, and it mainly resolves the “information flows” of international payment settlement."
How to View Russia’s Ejection From SWIFT,"Sina News , Wang Yongli","Feb 28, 2022","Actual processing of payment settlement: To settle the payment in a cross-border economic transaction, it is necessary to determine the specific clearing institution and settlement account, thereby determining the specific path for settlement instruction transmission and processing. The clearing institution carries out settlement account processing accordingly and deducts from the payer’s deposit. The processing is not considered completed until the transfer is made to the recipient’s account. If there is any problem, error finding and handling will still need to be carried out."
How to View Russia’s Ejection From SWIFT,"Sina News , Wang Yongli","Feb 28, 2022","One can see from the foregoing that SWIFT, as the infrastructure for the standard formulation of payment instruction messages and for transmitting and processing instructions, is a very important link in international payment settlement, but it is only one of the links, not the whole of international payment settlement. Also, although SWIFT is currently the most important global payment instruction messaging system, it is not the case that cross-border economic transactions absolutely cannot be carried out without SWIFT. In fact, SWIFT was announced only in 1973, and it took a long time for it to become a payment instruction messaging system with global coverage. Cross-border economic transactions also existed before there was SWIFT. It is only that the development of cross-border economic exchanges was better facilitated after the emergence of SWIFT. Likewise, when the Soviet Union and the United States were sharply opposed to each other and it was hard for the Eastern socialist camp to obtain SWIFT services, its internal transnational economic transactions still existed. The currency of the most powerful country in the camp could be chosen as the currency for denomination and settlement, with payments settled by means of encrypted telegrams, mail, etc. Even the necessity of settling payments one by one was obviated by adopting “bookkeeping settlement,” that is, within the scope of an agreement, the economic transactions occurring between the two sides were first entered in their account books, then differences were periodically (e.g., annually) aggregated, and settlement was only carried out on the balance. If a country is excluded by SWIFT now, that country can still imitate SWIFT’s messaging rules and establish a new payment instruction messaging system with other countries for settling economic transaction payments over the internet and other channels, which is not difficult technically, though its cost of operation and efficiency might not be comparable to those of SWIFT. So, describing SWIFT as a “financial nuclear bomb or killer app” is in fact a bit of an exaggeration."
How to View Russia’s Ejection From SWIFT,"Sina News , Wang Yongli","Feb 28, 2022","Second, what needs to be clarified even more are the relationships between payment settlement and economic transactions, and between cutting off SWIFT and the implementation of economic sanctions"
How to View Russia’s Ejection From SWIFT,"Sina News , Wang Yongli","Feb 28, 2022","Payment settlement is for economic transactions. If there were no transnational economic transactions, there would be no need for international payment settlement. Safe, efficient, and convenient settlement of international payments actively promotes the development of transnational economic transactions. Blocking the use of SWIFT will also have a profound impact on the development of a country’s foreign economic transactions, but blocking the use of SWIFT is only a means of economic sanctioning. The prerequisite for cutting off a country from the SWIFT information system is that the United States and Europe impose severe economic sanctions on the country. Without economic sanctions, the United States and Europe unilaterally blocking the SWIFT connection to Russia would also block their economic transactions with the country. Therefore, the economic sanctions against Russia by the U.S.-European camp are the main role, while cutting off SWIFT services is only a supporting role, and that order cannot be reversed."
How to View Russia’s Ejection From SWIFT,"Sina News , Wang Yongli","Feb 28, 2022","Hence, the widely circulated statement that “Iran lost nearly half of its oil export revenue and a large amount of foreign trade as a result of the United States push to cut off the SWIFT connection to Iran in 2012” is actually putting the cart before the horse. The fundamental reason for the significant reduction in Iran’s oil exports and other foreign trade was that the United States and Europe had imposed a severe blockade on Iran’s oil exports and other foreign trade, including their own cut-off of Iranian oil imports, not simply because SWIFT had cut off the connection to Iran."
How to View Russia’s Ejection From SWIFT,"Sina News , Wang Yongli","Feb 28, 2022","SWIFT is currently registered in Belgium and is mainly under the control of the European Union. At the same time, the United States has a major influence on it because the U.S. dollar occupies the most important position in international payments, so the EU and the United States together have decisive control over SWIFT. The announcement by the United States and Europe on removing selected Russian banks from SWIFT, and possibly even completely cutting off all Russian banks from SWIFT, means that those Russian banks will not be able to use the SWIFT infrastructure. Once the United States, the EU, Britain, and Canada announce the complete removal of Russian banks from SWIFT, it will also mean that these countries will be completely cut off from economic dealings with Russia, and it will also make it difficult for other countries to handle payment settlement with Russia through SWIFT. If other countries want to have economic dealings with Russia, they will have to establish a separate payment instruction transmission system with Russia, but they will also face the risk of being sanctioned by the U.S.-European camp. The U.S.-European camp has announced that it will also take action against those people and entities that provide facilitation to the Russia-Ukraine war and the Russian government. That is, they require other countries to control or cut off their economic dealings with Russia, which will force other countries to choose sides, either the camp with the United States, Europe, and other developed countries, or Russia. This would have a major impact not only on Russia, but it would also create a significant trade-off of interests for the many countries that have substantial amounts of economic dealings both with Russia and with the United States and Europe. If you choose Russia, you may offend or even break away from the U.S.-European camp and face the prospect of developed countries severing economic contacts, imposing advanced technology blockades, and blocking personnel exchanges, which would cause great harm to your own economic and social development. If you choose to join the U.S.-Europe-developed countries camp, you will thus cut off economic contacts with Russia. Since Russia is a major world exporter of energy, food, and minerals, as well as a permanent member of the United Nations [Security Council] with international influence, blocking Russia’s foreign trade and financial transactions would also have an impact on the international prices of related products and on global production and supply chains and financial markets, in addition to the impact on Europe’s current energy crisis and on the greater-than-expected inflation in the United States. If this causes SWIFT to cut off service to many countries that maintain trading and funds transactions with Russia, it will also give rise to alternatives to SWIFT, accelerate the internationalization of other currencies, and have a profound impact on SWIFT’s business development and the development of the U.S.-European camp’s foreign economic relations, as well as on the international circulation and international status of currencies such as the U.S. dollar and the euro. If this were to propel a serious division in the world and the formation of two sharply opposing camps, it would also pose a great threat to the development of economic globalization and to world peace and stability."

The real concern is the possible impact of the U.S. and European camps implementing severe economic sanctions or even fully decoupling.

Ideal Security Environment and China’s Grand Strategy in the New Century,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Dec 5, 2000","A country’s ideal security environment is determined by many factors2, such as its geographical environment, and its definition of national interests. For example, the ideal security environment of the United States can be simply summarized as one where “no other power (including an alliance of powers) can compete with the United States.” Therefore, the grand strategy of the United States is to “prevent the rise of any power that might challenge the United States or prevent and impede such a power from confronting the United States.”3‎ As another example, Singapore’s ideal security environment is “a peaceful and stable regional and international environment conducive to economic development.” Therefore, Singapore’s grand strategy is to maintain peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and a prosperous international economic environment."

Ideal Security Environment and China’s Grand Strategy in the New Century,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Dec 5, 2000","1. Maintain an effective strategic deterrence. Strategic deterrence has become one of the cornerstones of the international security framework. ‎ Therefore,7 China must maintain an effective “minimum nuclear deterrence” to prevent any potentially hostile power from threatening its vital interests. The missile defense system that the United States and Japan seek to develop is the most dangerous factor that could cause structural changes in the international security environment. Once this missile defense system is successfully deployed, it will fundamentally shake the understanding of national security established since World War II, namely: that national security is based on interdependence and mutual deterrence, so national security is relative. Under such a strategic situation, the unilateral development of a missile defense system by any country or camp would break the understanding of security as interdependent and based on mutual nuclear deterrence. Offense would once again predominate over defense, thereby greatly aggravating the security dilemma between nations and leading to a new arms race. The nuclear powers must either cooperate in the development of missile defense systems or exercise restraint. Otherwise, the escalation of the arms race will be unavoidable."

A new “multipolar world” that does not repeat the constant wars and turmoil in European history is in China’s interests, but China’s grand strategy should not be determined by a particular international structure. Although human history records many large-scale wars that broke out in Europe under multipolar world conditions, from the perspective of international relations theory, a multipolar structure greatly restricts the behavior of states in at least three aspects: 1) A multipolar world places the most powerful constraints on the actions of states, especially great powers;8 2) In a multipolar world there is minimal pressure for great powers to involve themselves in conflicts where they have no real interest because of “face” or “credibility;” 9‎ 3) Uncertainty about their allies makes great powers cautious10‎."
Ideal Security Environment and China’s Grand Strategy in the New Century,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Dec 5, 2000","The new multipolar world will be qualitatively different from the war-torn “multipolar world” of continental Europe in the following ways: 1) None of the major powers is (or at least is not explicitly) an enemy of any other, and all major powers maintain relatively stable bilateral relations in order to maintain strategic ambiguity and flexibility. The ambiguity and flexibility of this strategy help to undermine the ambitions of great powers. 2) Great powers are determined to repair relationships when they fall to a low point (such as in Sino-U.S. relations). 3) The deepening of economic interdependence and international norms/international institutions are even more important factors for stabilizing relations between great powers. 4) In addition to bilateral cooperation, great powers also seek multilateral cooperation. 5) Although power is still the basis of inter-state politics, the pursuit of territorial expansion has become difficult to achieve, or in other words, the world of the past where “might made right” has become milder. All of these factors have the potential to make the new multipolar structure more peaceful and stable. However, changes in the international structure generally cannot be driven by people, but are mainly the result of economic development (non-equilibrium growth) or even accidental factors.11 Therefore, China’s grand strategy should not be determined by a particular international structure."

Ideal Security Environment and China’s Grand Strategy in the New Century,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Dec 5, 2000","1. National economic strength is the ultimate guarantee of national security. Therefore, one of China’s most important strategic security goals is to ensure that China’s economic foundation is safe from attack. To achieve this, China must have sufficient deterrence capabilities to prevent any adversary from attempting to attack China’s economic foundation due to fear of painful retaliatory strikes. We must change our understanding of the role of defensive forces: The task of defensive forces is first to deter, and second, to have sufficient defensive force to repel the enemy when deterrence fails. China’s coastal areas have become the lifeblood of China’s economy. For the foreseeable future, the countries capable of actually posing substantial threats to our coastal areas are the United States and Japan. Therefore, while maintaining our deterrent power, we must also maintain Sino-U.S. relations at least at the level of “not friends, but not enemies” (非敌非友)."
Ideal Security Environment and China’s Grand Strategy in the New Century,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Dec 5, 2000","The triangular Sino-U.S.-Japan relationship is the most important trilateral relationship in the Asia-Pacific region. Unfortunately, however, a triangular relationship is the most unstable type of combination relationship in the international structure. Therefore, China, the United States, and Japan must be aware of the difficulty and importance of handling this triangular relationship, and especially its balanced development12."
Ideal Security Environment and China’s Grand Strategy in the New Century,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Dec 5, 2000","2. Although China’s economic foundation is mostly concentrated in the coastal areas, China is a mainland country after all, and security on land is the foundation of China’s security. Therefore, China must consolidate its security environment on the Asian continent. Moreover, the most frightening threat to our land security environment is a hostile Russia. Therefore, another important strategic security goal of China is to prevent a re-emergent Russia from becoming an enemy of China. China cannot and should not prevent Russia’s re-emergence, but we can strive to make an again-powerful Russia a friend."
Ideal Security Environment and China’s Grand Strategy in the New Century,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Dec 5, 2000","No matter how powerful China and Russia are in themselves, if they are at odds with each other, their strategic positions will be greatly weakened. Conversely, if the two sides can support each other, this will greatly strengthen the strategic positions of both. There is no natural geographical barrier between China and Russia. If there is ever bad blood between them, the “security dilemma” will be unbearable (this is borne out by the past history of China and the Soviet Union). Therefore, from a long-term perspective, Sino-Russian relations are no less important than Sino-U.S. relations. As a proud nation, what Russia hates most is when others look down on it, and history has proven that Russia is the most terrible enemy of those who look down on it. Therefore, China must give Russia the respect it deserves and strive to keep Russia as a friendly partner even after it is strong13."

Given that there are still many uncertainties in the relationships between China, Russia, the United States, and Japan, no side wants to see a unified Korean peninsula fall into the sphere of influence of another side. The geographical location of the Korean peninsula means that a unified Korean peninsula and the formation of a military alliance by any side would worsen the security dilemma of the other sides, thereby creating a hidden danger to the long-term stability of the region."

Pursuing a neutral unification of the Korean peninsula is not only conducive to promoting the reunification of the Korean peninsula and realizing the national goal of the Korean nation. It can also set a precedent for multilateral cooperation among the Big Four.14 Therefore, China’s most realistic and most ideal security goal in Northeast Asia should be a neutral and unified Korean peninsula."

Taking account of China’s interests, the United States would no longer insist on stationing troops on the reunified Korean Peninsula; while China, taking account of the interests of the United States, would not pursue a “pro-China” Korean Peninsula. Such mutual concessions would lay a substantive foundation for more cooperation between China and the United States."

Ideal Security Environment and China’s Grand Strategy in the New Century,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Dec 5, 2000","The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) would welcome a situation where the power of major countries could be roughly balanced making it impossible for these powers to control regional affairs 17. This situation is in the interest of China as well as the interest of the other major powers. From this point of view, if ASEAN can truly become a “peaceful, free, and neutral zone,” this should be welcomed by all major countries, 18 even though it may be very difficult to realize this ideal."
Ideal Security Environment and China’s Grand Strategy in the New Century,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Dec 5, 2000","The Asia-Pacific region is the region most likely to form a multipolar world, and the ASEAN is bound to be an important force among them. China and many ASEAN countries share the common interest of pursuing a multipolar world. However, whether ASEAN can become a pole, or how solid it is as a pole depends to a large extent on two points: 1) The cohesion of ASEAN and the judgment of major powers as to the strength of ASEAN; 2) The leading status of Indonesia as the largest ASEAN country and the quality of its leadership. Furthermore, Vietnam’s influence on the Indochina Peninsula is a point that is likely to become increasingly important in the future."
Ideal Security Environment and China’s Grand Strategy in the New Century,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Dec 5, 2000","Since ASEAN already includes all the countries in Southeast Asia, in forming a high degree of cohesion within the organization, the focus of ASEAN’s future efforts will be to establish an institutional policy coordination and intervention mechanism. Judging from its responses to the last two crises (the financial crisis and the Indonesia/Timor-Leste crisis), ASEAN still cannot effectively handle crises at critical times. Therefore, at least for now, ASEAN is not a real pole in the Asia-Pacific region, or at best it is a weak pole. Second, if ASEAN wants to become a pole in the Asia-Pacific region, it must “walk a tightrope” in its relations with major powers: That is to say, it cannot be too close to any one major power, but nor can it be too distant. This is a difficult balance to strike. In addition, the different countries in ASEAN have quite different attitudes towards the major powers. Therefore, even if ASEAN becomes a true pole, it still has to learn to speak with one voice. Moreover, it is difficult for an alliance to become a true pole as there will be inevitable conflicts between the interests of the countries within the alliance 19. Within ASEAN, three countries play a key role for the future of ASEAN: Indonesia, Vietnam, and Myanmar. The importance of Indonesia to ASEAN does not need to be discussed, and the participation of the three Indochinese countries Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos in the Indochina Peninsula increased Vietnam’s influence on regional affairs overnight. Myanmar’s pivotal strategic position in Southeast Asia is also clearly evident: Myanmar not only straddles the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, but it also brings together the north and south parts of Southeast Asia."
Ideal Security Environment and China’s Grand Strategy in the New Century,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Dec 5, 2000","Therefore, on the basis of strengthening relations with all ASEAN countries, China must strengthen its relations with Indonesia, Vietnam, and Myanmar. It is critical that China and Indonesia develop some sort of strategic partnership (although the situation in Indonesia remains volatile). For a long time, the relationship between China and Indonesia has been in an unstable state for historical and cultural reasons. As a result,  Indonesia’s China policy has long been based on a hostile and distrustful stance 20. It is necessary for China to strengthen relations with Indonesia in all respects, including the relations between the two militaries."
Ideal Security Environment and China’s Grand Strategy in the New Century,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Dec 5, 2000","The recent warming in Sino-Vietnamese relations shows that Vietnam has become increasingly aware that other powers can come and go, while China will always be Vietnam’s neighbor (of course, this does not mean that Vietnam is no longer wary of China). On the basis of this sort of strategic understanding, Sino-Vietnamese relations can take a significant step forward."
Ideal Security Environment and China’s Grand Strategy in the New Century,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Dec 5, 2000","Therefore, on the basis of existing economic cooperation with the ASEAN countries, China should promote economic cooperation in the Lancang-Mekong sub-region (including China’s Yunnan province, Vietnam, Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand). The intent of this sub-regional economic cooperation is not to turn the region into China’s sphere of influence, but to establish “interdependence” between these countries and China, so as to bring the interests of the various countries into closer alignment and drive the economic development of China’s southwest region in coordination with China Western Development. This will be more conducive to the improvement of the security environment around China. In the future, China is bound to become an important market and source of technology/capital for Southeast Asian countries. These factors will provide the real-world necessity for the development of sub-regional economic cooperation. China must extensively participate in various ASEAN consultation and institutionalization processes. Only in this way can China ensure that, no matter how ASEAN develops, China can effectively establish wide-ranging relations with ASEAN and maintain its influence over regional affairs. The attitudes of the various ASEAN countries towards major powers range from relatively friendly to relatively skeptical. This also determines that, as long as China does not adopt excessive policies, the ASEAN policy toward China will be relatively moderate, This not only serves China’s strategic interests, but also benefits the security of the region as a whole."

Guarantee regional stability in Central Asia, prevent religious extremism and separatism in the region from threatening the security of China’s western region, and guarantee China’s access to Central Asian energy supplies when necessary. To achieve these goals, the best strategy is to vigorously promote the economic integration of Central Asia. Given the fact that Russia still sees Central Asia as its backyard and the importance of Sino-Russian relations, China should try to persuade Russia to cooperate more extensively with China in Central Asia."
Ideal Security Environment and China’s Grand Strategy in the New Century,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Dec 5, 2000","Economic integration in Central Asia would provide the following benefits at least: 1) Economic growth brought about by economic integration can provide an economic foundation for the stability and development of the region. 2) To a certain extent, economic development can also curb the power of Muslim extremism. 3) Economic integration can lay a solid foundation for other cooperations in the region. 4) Sino-Russian cooperation in the economic integration of Central Asia can eliminate the possibility of damage to the Sino-Russian partnership due to conflicting interests in the region. 5) The economic integration of Central Asia will also cooperate with China’s western development plan to achieve the strategy of a “two-sided attack” with respect to the development of the northwest region."
Ideal Security Environment and China’s Grand Strategy in the New Century,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Dec 5, 2000","The promotion of economic integration in Central Asia can be carried out on the basis of the annual meeting of the five heads of state of China, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Russia. The annual meeting of the five heads of state is already an international mechanism and can promote the interdependence and mutual trust of the countries and make these countries place a greater value on cooperation. Economic integration in Central Asia is a good strategy, or even the only strategy, by which Central Asian countries can adapt to economic globalization21."
Ideal Security Environment and China’s Grand Strategy in the New Century,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Dec 5, 2000","Finally, the economic integration of Central Asia has a deeper geopolitical significance. The current fierce competition among various forces in the region introduces latent factors of instability to the region.

The Gulf War gave the United States and Britain the perfect excuse to maintain their hold over the Persian Gulf situation in perpetuity. The reliance of many Arab countries on the United States and its allies makes the Gulf an inland sea of the United States. This makes is it far less likely that any other outside power will intervene in the region and challenge the position of the United States. If the U.S. presence and influence in the Gulf region are weakened, this will be mostly due to changes in the domestic political situations of pro-U.S. Gulf countries, which will eventually force the United States to withdraw from the Gulf."

Given that the United States already controls the west coast of the Persian Gulf, China and Russia should seek to expand relations with Iran, which sits on the east coast of the Gulf. The goal of developing this relationship should not be to challenge U.S. hegemony in the Gulf.

Ideal Security Environment and China’s Grand Strategy in the New Century,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Dec 5, 2000","The grand strategy of a country inevitably involves some questions that are almost “philosophical.” The answers given to these questions basically determine the general conception of a country’s grand strategy. Here, we will discuss some issues that have already received a great deal of attention in an attempt to tie such discussions to specific security issues."
Ideal Security Environment and China’s Grand Strategy in the New Century,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Dec 5, 2000","1. The international structure should not determine China’s grand security strategy. Because the impact of the international structure on a country’s security environment is far less decisive than is widely believed, the international structure should not determine China’s grand security strategy. In fact, changes in the international structure have historically been “accidental” in origin: the unpredictable consequences of “unbalanced growth”25 and wars, rather than conscious initiative. When a certain “unipolar,” “bipolar,” or “multipolar” structure of the world arrives, it does so in a completely “natural”, or you could say “random,” manner. The international structure is only an additional product of world development. In fact, it is difficult for a state to establish a certain type of structure for the purpose of one’s grand strategy. Most of the time, the diplomacy of a state is how the state seeks to raise or at least maintain its position in the structure at present and for the foreseeable future. Historically, the most successful countries are the ones that adapt best to the environment. As Guiguzi said: “In ancient times, those who did well in the world had to weigh the powers of the world and comprehend the minds of princes” (古之善用天下者，必量天下之权而揣诸侯之情)."
Ideal Security Environment and China’s Grand Strategy in the New Century,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Dec 5, 2000","Given that the current global pattern will continue to exist for a considerable period of time26, while taking the establishment of a global multipolar world as its long-term strategic goal, China should place more emphasis on seeking to establish an ideal security environment in the important areas around China. This is because, under the same global structure, different regions will have different regional structures27."
Ideal Security Environment and China’s Grand Strategy in the New Century,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Dec 5, 2000","The establishment of a regional multipolar structure does not contradict the current unipolar world (or one superpower) on the global scale. The United States, as a global power, must necessarily disperse its power. However, as an Asia-Pacific country, China can concentrate its power on pursuing its interests in the Asia-Pacific region. Because of the existence of Japan, China, ASEAN, and Russia, it is reasonable to hold that East Asia will be the first region in the world to start the formation of a multipolar world28. If there is any region where the United States cannot get its own way, it must be in East Asia."
Ideal Security Environment and China’s Grand Strategy in the New Century,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Dec 5, 2000","Second, if we hope for a multipolar world, we must prepare for the consequences of multipolarity. The most important of these consequences is the question of Japan’s status. Japan, as America’s most important ally in Asia, cannot truly escape the orbit of the United States (nor does it intend to escape the orbit of the United States), and the United States will not allow Japan to escape from its orbit. However, as a great power, Japan should naturally also play an important role in international affairs, because in a multi-polar world, Japan will rightfully constitute one pole. This means that what China has to consider is not whether to accept Japan’s role, but to what extent to accept it. On these issues, China has not considered enough."
Ideal Security Environment and China’s Grand Strategy in the New Century,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Dec 5, 2000","2. Development and shaping: Security interdependence. “Development is the absolute principle” (发展才是硬道理) is still the ultimate means for countries (especially major powers) to ensure their own security in a state of anarchy. However, the national security environment is a system. Therefore, a country’s grand strategy is not only concerned with developing its strength. This is because a country, especially a major country like China, will definitely have a major influence on international politics, especially on some surrounding countries, when it develops. China’s development has not only changed its own security environment, but also the security environments of other countries. Likewise, changes in the security environments of other countries will in turn affect China’s security environment. Therefore, in order to shape the ideal security environment for a country, it is necessary to attempt to influence the security environments and policies of other countries."
Ideal Security Environment and China’s Grand Strategy in the New Century,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Dec 5, 2000","This requires China to work with other countries to mitigate the “security dilemma” and shape a favorable security environment for China while it develops. From this point of view, development and shaping are equally important to the country’s grand strategy."
Ideal Security Environment and China’s Grand Strategy in the New Century,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Dec 5, 2000","No matter how powerful China itself is, China’s security will always depend on other countries. Therefore, China’s ideal security environment must necessarily contain an “idealistic” (理想主义, as in the international relations theory of “idealism”) side. This is not just because Chinese culture has always upheld a sense of justice. In addition, it is because, if it has no moral code, a grand strategy cannot win the support of the people, nor can it be accepted by other countries, nor can it succeed."
Ideal Security Environment and China’s Grand Strategy in the New Century,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Dec 5, 2000","3. Shaping the surrounding security environment: The utility of multilateralism. When shaping the surrounding security environment, we should not only use traditional bilateral cooperation, but, even more, promote multilateral cooperation to closely link the interests of more countries. China should seek more multilateral cooperation, especially regional economic cooperation, in several regions around China that offer a high possibility of multilateral cooperation, such as Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Central Asia."
Ideal Security Environment and China’s Grand Strategy in the New Century,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Dec 5, 2000","The ultimate goal of such multilateral regional cooperation is that, in the next fifteen to twenty years, when China’s economic scale has made it a large market both in absolute terms and in terms of purchasing power, China will have followed a different strategy of economic development from Japan, that is, China will gradually become a big market for neighboring countries. This sort of open economic system will, in a sense, establish an economic system arrayed in a ring around China. This ability to link the economies of neighboring countries with China’s economic system will greatly strengthen China’s influence on its surrounding security environment, and will also greatly mitigate the concerns that neighboring countries have about China’s strength. From this perspective, China must pay attention to the three (sub)regional economic cooperation zones (Lancang-Mekong, Bay of Bengal, Central Asia) relevant to western China. These three (sub)regional economic cooperation zones run from south to north and these, together with the “China-Japan-Korea Economic Cooperative” (or other Northeast Asian regional economic cooperation method)29 currently under discussion, will cover almost all of China’s major neighbors. In the next 20 to 30 years, if the economic cooperation in these regions can become a substantial economic cooperation zone or an economic integration organization, this will not only provide an international environment for the development of the western regions of China, but also make the various countries interdependent and provide a guarantee for the stability and peace of the entire region. Ultimately, when China became the undisputed largest economy in East Asia, China also became a bridge linking the economic regions of South Asia, Central and Western Asia, and East Asia. Such a China will undoubtedly be one of the pillars for the stability of the Asia-Pacific region in the future, regardless of the number of poles of the future structure of the Asia-Pacific region."
Ideal Security Environment and China’s Grand Strategy in the New Century,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Dec 5, 2000","At present, the concept of security in the Asia-Pacific region is still a situation of competition among various concepts. These range from the concept of “peace under hegemony” of the United States, to the “comprehensive security” of ASEAN, to the “new security concept” advocated by China and Russia, to the “multilateral security” of Canada30. But in fact, excepting the ideologically conflicting “peace under hegemony” concept of the United States, the various multilateral security concepts have much in common with each other. How to find common ground among these multilateral security concepts and build a multilateral security mechanism that serves the interests of not only China, but also other countries will become the most important issue in China’s future security strategy."
Ideal Security Environment and China’s Grand Strategy in the New Century,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Dec 5, 2000","The direction of the reunified Korean peninsula is a good opportunity: If China can make the reunified Korean peninsula a neutral country, not only would this go a long way towards eliminating the biggest security risk in Northeast China, but it would also show that China does not consider only its own security interests, but that it also takes into account the interests of other major powers and the Korean nation itself. This would build a certain degree of mutual security and trust among the major powers."
Ideal Security Environment and China’s Grand Strategy in the New Century,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Dec 5, 2000","The interactivity, incompatibility, and irreversibility of national security policy choices. The national security environment is a system. Therefore, changes at any point may cause changes at other points, or even changes in the system as a whole. This means that, many times, in order to achieve certain strategic goals, we must consider the interaction of different policies. This is the interactivity of national security policy choices."
Ideal Security Environment and China’s Grand Strategy in the New Century,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Dec 5, 2000","The systemic nature of the national security environment means that the consequences of a state’s security policies are almost always impossible to judge in isolation. In many cases, the choice of one policy limits other options. This is because two options may be inherently contradictory, or the result of the first option makes the second option impossible. Moreover, once a chosen policy is found to be unworkable or inconsistent with the country’s strategic goals, it is impossible to return to the original point and choose another policy. This is the incompatibility and irreversibility of national security policy choices."

First has been the building of an anti-corruption work setup under comprehensive Party leadership. We have built robust anti-corruption work systems and mechanisms for which the Party Centre conducts unified leadership, Party committees at all levels exercise coordinated command, discipline inspection commissions and supervision commissions organize and coordinate, and functional departments efficiently cooperate, and which the people participate in and support. Second has been to take treating symptoms as the entry point, incorporating the treatment of root causes into the treatment of symptoms, seeing that Party members and cadres ‘dare not’ be corrupt due to their reverence, ‘are not able’ to be corrupt due to institutions, and ‘do not want’ to be corrupt due to their own awareness. Third has been to always adhere to the principle of never wavering from the dominant tone of strictness, punishing corruption with a zero-tolerance attitude, resolutely curbing any increase and reducing existing stocks [of corruption], solemnly investigating and dealing with corruption issues that hinder the implementation of the Party’s theories, lines, principles, and policies or that seriously damage the foundation of the Party’s governance, resolutely eliminating two-faced people who show outward devotion to the Party but harbor inner opposition (对党阳奉阴违) and corrupt elements who do not restrain themselves, deepening anti-corruption work in key areas, and ensuring our attitude doesn’t change, determination doesn’t wane, and standards do not loosen. Fourth has been to tighten the institutional cage to prevent corruption. We have formed a complete set of relatively well-developed intra-party regulation and anti-corruption legal systems, strengthened the binding nature of systems, prevented the “broken window effect,” looped together discipline enforcement and law enforcement, strengthened comprehensive efficiency, and ensured that various regulations and systems take root. Fifth has been to build an ideological dam that resists corruption and denigration, using ideals and beliefs to strengthen and consolidate the foundations, using the Party’s innovative theory to arm the whole Party, and using fine traditional culture to right hearts and elucidate morals, taking sufficient spiritual “calcium” supplements, forging the “soul” of the mind, and building a solid ideological and moral line of defense. Sixth has been to strengthen constraints on and supervision over the exercise of power, deepening the reform of the Party’s discipline inspection system and the reform of the national supervision system, achieving full coverage of intra-party supervision and full coverage of public functionary supervision, strengthening the Party’s self-supervision and mass supervision, looping together the discovery of problems, encouragement of rectification, promotion of reform, and improvement of systems, and educating and guiding Party members and cadres to use power with impartiality, in accordance with law, with integrity, and for the people."

Fourth has been to tighten the institutional cage to prevent corruption. We have formed a complete set of relatively well-developed intra-party regulation and anti-corruption legal systems, strengthened the binding nature of systems, prevented the “broken window effect,” looped together discipline enforcement and law enforcement, strengthened comprehensive efficiency, and ensured that various regulations and systems take root. Fifth has been to build an ideological dam that resists corruption and denigration, using ideals and beliefs to strengthen and consolidate the foundations, using the Party’s innovative theory to arm the whole Party, and using fine traditional culture to right hearts and elucidate morals, taking sufficient spiritual “calcium” supplements, forging the “soul” of the mind, and building a solid ideological and moral line of defense. Sixth has been to strengthen constraints on and supervision over the exercise of power, deepening the reform of the Party’s discipline inspection system and the reform of the national supervision system, achieving full coverage of intra-party supervision and full coverage of public functionary supervision, strengthening the Party’s self-supervision and mass supervision, looping together the discovery of problems, encouragement of rectification, promotion of reform, and improvement of systems, and educating and guiding Party members and cadres to use power with impartiality, in accordance with law, with integrity, and for the people."

Improving Sino-European Relations Is Just as Important as Preventing “Sino-U.S. Relations From Spiraling Out of Control”,"Fudan Development Institute , Fudan Europe Watch","Jun 1, 2022",1. Will the EU really “decouple” from China’s trade and economy?
Improving Sino-European Relations Is Just as Important as Preventing “Sino-U.S. Relations From Spiraling Out of Control”,"Fudan Development Institute , Fudan Europe Watch","Jun 1, 2022","Fang Jiongsheng: At this stage, the EU has no intention to push for complete decoupling from China, but will adopt the following two means to gradually reduce its “strategic dependence” on China. First, a “China+1” production chain diversification strategy will be adopted, with production and marketing bases in China retained, while setting up second bases in India or Southeast Asia and other regions that have recently carried out key cooperation. Second, with the help of the recently passed Directive on Sustainable Corporate Governance, European enterprises will be required to fulfill their responsibility to disclose environmental and labor rights issues in the production chain."
Improving Sino-European Relations Is Just as Important as Preventing “Sino-U.S. Relations From Spiraling Out of Control”,"Fudan Development Institute , Fudan Europe Watch","Jun 1, 2022","Jian Junbo: First, in terms of production chains, the EU is seeking to transfer out of China trade and investment that is dependent on China. Although the European Supply Chain Act being promoted is not nominally designed for China, it contains important objectives to reduce economic and trade dependence on China. Other examples include the establishment of the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council, the attempt to establish an EU-U.S. rare earth alliance, and the establishment of “investment review mechanisms” for foreign investors, all of which have the purpose of reducing “dependence” on China. The promotion of anti-economic coercion legislation and other technical barriers to foreign trade also partly serves to hinder economic and trade relations with China. It is also relatively obvious that the intention of strengthening economic and trade relations with emerging Asian countries through the “Indo-Pacific Strategy” is to weaken economic and trade relations with China."

In the context of the U.S.-China game and increasingly complex Sino-European relations, the confidence of European enterprises in the stability and predictability of the Chinese market has declined to a certain extent."

In any case, reducing economic and trade dependence on China will be a long-term strategy for Europe."
Improving Sino-European Relations Is Just as Important as Preventing “Sino-U.S. Relations From Spiraling Out of Control”,"Fudan Development Institute , Fudan Europe Watch","Jun 1, 2022","Andrea Ghiselli: The current situation in Sino-European relations is very complicated. There is no doubt that the situation has deteriorated compared to a few years ago, but it is not clear whether it has bottomed out. If relations between China and the EU are to be improved, it is necessary to pay attention to Europe’s view. It wants China to exert more influence on Russia in the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. This means that for the first time European leaders regard China as a real player in European security issues. In other words, the insulating effect of geographical distance has been weakened."
Improving Sino-European Relations Is Just as Important as Preventing “Sino-U.S. Relations From Spiraling Out of Control”,"Fudan Development Institute , Fudan Europe Watch","Jun 1, 2022","Ma Bin: The EU is accelerating the restructuring of its economic relationship with China. While using the term “decoupling” to describe EU policy may be conducive to the political marketing of politicians and the traffic-generating games of the media, the EU’s main goal now is to mitigate risks by reducing dependence on China in key segments of the production chain, rather than to cut economic ties with China. However, if China-EU relations increasingly slide into geopolitical and ideological battles, continuing to reduce economic ties with China will also be a realistic policy option for the EU. While economic cooperation with China is important for the EU, it is also the expectation of EU China policy that China will play a more constructive role in practical cooperation in a broader range of areas, especially in mitigating and addressing the geopolitical risks facing the EU."

Judging from the draft final statement, the EU intends to reduce its dependence on China in the major areas of photovoltaic products, rare earths, and chips. But this goal is still far from decoupling. Unlike the United States with its aggressive separation from China, the EU sees China as a competitor rather than an enemy in the trade arena. The EU is most likely to further strengthen supply chain diversification in key areas and remain guarded against Chinese investment in Europe, but decoupling from China is not an EU policy goal."

In terms of economic and trade cooperation with China, the EU places more emphasis on “reciprocity.” After the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, the EU began to pay attention to the issue of dependence on China, emphasizing the reduction of dependence on China in strategic areas, and the Russia-Ukraine crisis has intensified this trend, but the EU will not make decoupling a policy option."
Improving Sino-European Relations Is Just as Important as Preventing “Sino-U.S. Relations From Spiraling Out of Control”,"Fudan Development Institute , Fudan Europe Watch","Jun 1, 2022","Yao Xu: The EU’s “decoupling” from China is not the direct aim of Europe’s strategic autonomy and “resilient” production chain construction, but there is the possibility of it becoming the end result under the existing security dilemma. The technology war and technology blockades and sanctions unveiled by the United States against China have forced China to seek its own R&D and production capacity in key and core technologies, but this process is often seen from the European perspective as eventually replacing existing European production chains, creating a dilemma in the production chain field. The Russia-Ukraine conflict has opened a Pandora’s box, and the previous calculations of Western multinationals for profits have given way to simple and crude political side-taking. The EU and China both need to do their best to manage conflicts and tensions, seek cooperation and win-win outcomes, and prevent “decoupling” from becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy."

The so-called transfer of production chains to Southeast Asia cannot be achieved overnight, either. But on the other hand, whether in terms of its own development or its foreign strategy, China needs to prevent this political “decoupling” rhetoric in Europe from becoming the common perception and action of industries and enterprises."
Improving Sino-European Relations Is Just as Important as Preventing “Sino-U.S. Relations From Spiraling Out of Control”,"Fudan Development Institute , Fudan Europe Watch","Jun 1, 2022","To this end, first, China needs to continue to expand its markets and respond to “decoupling” with “binding.” The past history of development is that we cannot do without the European and U.S. markets, and in the future we need to make Europe and the United States truly unable to do without the Chinese market. Second, China should rely on innovation to possess the irreplaceable elements of the production chain, and build a more positive relationship with the outside world. Third, China should consider how to enlarge the common market and achieve “binding of interests.”"

For the latter, avoiding political and supply chain security risks induced by the turbulent world situation will become an important consideration. Second, in the political sphere, China-EU political relations historically have been dominated and driven by economic and trade relations. In the future, the “ballast” role of bilateral trade and commerce in China-EU political relations will weaken, and ideology will rise to be an important factor limiting the stability of China-EU political relations. Third, in terms of regulating competition, internally the EU is promoting the Regulation on Foreign Direct Investment Screening and the Anti-Coercion Instrument Act (Draft), and externally, together with its allies, it is exerting pressure on China on issues such as WTO reform."

Improving Sino-European Relations Is Just as Important as Preventing “Sino-U.S. Relations From Spiraling Out of Control”,"Fudan Development Institute , Fudan Europe Watch","Jun 1, 2022","Fang Jiongsheng: The core difference between Europe and the United States is that, since the United States is a hegemonic state, its China policy toolbox is far richer than the EU’s. The United States holds strong rule-making power in global finance and other fields, and controls core technologies and markets in cutting-edge technology fields such as chips. This has led the United States to objectively have isolation, cutting off supplies, and other “stranglehold” capabilities when formulating policies toward China. Compared with the United States, the EU’s interdependence with China’s is more reciprocal, and it lacks “killer apps” that can have a significant impact on China. Therefore, the EU is unable to have a “showdown” with China. This provides us more ample policy space for handling relations with Europe."

The two sides have extensive and close strategic, security, economic, cultural, ethnic, and historical ties, and when facing China, it is more a difference in roles than a difference in directions. After the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the EU quickly reconciled its internal differences and endured huge economic costs to work with the United States against Russia, indicating that its pursuit of strategic and security goals is more urgent."

In practice, however, there are differences in the strategic priorities of the EU and the United States towards China. For the EU, responding to Russia’s military action in Ukraine is the sole focus of its strategy, while with China it strives to avoid expanding the political conflicts. In contrast, although the United States has increased sanctions against Russia in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, China has always been its primary target for containment. Therefore, except in terms of ideology, the EU does not focus on containing China’s influence in political, economic, technological, and other areas as the United States does, and competition—without excluding cooperation—will be the main direction of EU China policy."

In the speech on China policy given by Secretary of State Blinken last Thursday, the United States proposed a new policy framework for China, namely, “investment, alliance, and competition,” setting the main tone and means of China policy.

In the United States, the forces and voices for friendly and enhanced cooperation with China have gradually diminished in recent years, with tough confrontation becoming the new “political correctness.” There remain different voices behind Europe’s policies towards China, with organizations including European manufacturing giants such as Volkswagen and other automobile companies, and EU chambers of commerce, still calling on various occasions for further deepening cooperation between China and the EU. Therefore, with their different internal supports, the European and U.S. policies towards China may produce different directions in the future."
Improving Sino-European Relations Is Just as Important as Preventing “Sino-U.S. Relations From Spiraling Out of Control”,"Fudan Development Institute , Fudan Europe Watch","Jun 1, 2022","Zhang Yaning: The similarities between the two are that their foreign policies are strongly guided by ideology, and their strategic perceptions of China are fundamentally close. The differences lie mainly in the different perceptions of the relative weight of “economic interests” and “competitive threats.” Specifically, economic interests are the most important interest of EU diplomacy with China, as well as the most important means. Diplomatic objectives that are less related to economic interests or cannot be achieved by economic and trade means are not core diplomatic interests of the EU. The aforementioned differences depend fundamentally on two factors: On one hand, in contrast to U.S.-China relations, there is no obvious geo-security conflict between China and the EU; on the other hand, the EU is essentially still an economic actor based on a unified market and regulation. Therefore, its foreign policy objectives and diplomatic abilities are both relatively single-faceted."

In the energy shortage situation, China can utilize its advantages in solar panels, wind power equipment, and lithium batteries to strengthen energy cooperation with Europe. Second, in the multilateral arena, it can jointly promote poverty reduction in underdeveloped countries and regions, and anti-drug, anti-crime, and peacekeeping cooperation, as well as cooperation on climate change and addressing the current epidemic and the looming global food security issue.

Industrial Structure Upgrading Requires Forming an “Innovation-Scale” Virtuous Cycle,"Tsinghua People's Bank of China School of Finance (PBCSF) , Ju Jiandong","May 17, 2022","The Tsinghua People’s Bank of China School of Finance Chief Economists Forum was successfully held on May 14, 2022. The theme of the forum was “Turbulent 2022—Global & China Economy and Policy Outlook.” It entailed in-depth discussions centered on four major roundtable topics. Ju Jiandong, Unigroup Chair Professor of Finance, Tsinghua University People’s Bank of China School of Finance, and director of the Center for International Finance and Economics Research (CIFER) at the Tsinghua National Institute for Financial Research, attended the third roundtable discussion “Innovation, Finance, and S&T Competition” and gave a talk."
Industrial Structure Upgrading Requires Forming an “Innovation-Scale” Virtuous Cycle,"Tsinghua People's Bank of China School of Finance (PBCSF) , Ju Jiandong","May 17, 2022","Ju Jiandong believes that upgrading the industrial structure necessitates the formation of an “innovation-scale” virtuous cycle. It is only by overcoming international technology constraints and monopolies, ensuring a certain amount of market share for domestic technologies, and cultivating and developing the competitiveness of domestic technologies that we can realize Chinese technological innovation and industrial upgrading. In view of this, Ju Jiandong proposed a policy of “countering international technology containment” (反国际技术遏制政策), ensuring a 30% domestic market share for Chinese technology, so as to provide the necessary market demand for Chinese technology and pave the way to Chinese technological upgrades. Ju Jiandong suggested that a two trillion RMB per year economic stimulus plan be employed over the next 10 years to promote such a full production chain policy of “countering international technology containment.” Through precise monetary injections, this would build an independent and self-reliant high-technology industrial system in an open economic environment, thus promoting Chinese technological upgrades and realizing [the aim that] “the economy must be kept stable and development must be safe.” Ju Jiandong pointed out that this stimulus plan could increase China’s GDP growth rate by 1%."

Industrial Structure Upgrading Requires Forming an “Innovation-Scale” Virtuous Cycle,"Tsinghua People's Bank of China School of Finance (PBCSF) , Ju Jiandong","May 17, 2022","Everyone taking part in this roundtable discussion is an expert, and we’re all experts at the cutting edge who have long studied our country’s S&T competition. We just mentioned how, given Chinese-U.S. S&T competition, international technology constraints on industrial upgrading can be overcome. We discussed chips. Chips are a typical, gradually changing technology. In the case of the transition from 10 nanometers to 7 nanometers, technological innovations were achieved through update iterations of the old technology and a gradual accumulation. If our industrial structure cannot be upgraded, then there will be no way to promote economic growth."
Industrial Structure Upgrading Requires Forming an “Innovation-Scale” Virtuous Cycle,"Tsinghua People's Bank of China School of Finance (PBCSF) , Ju Jiandong","May 17, 2022","How is the industrial structure to be upgraded? Thinking about it from an intellectual point of view, we find that, on the theoretical level, there is an “innovation-scale” cycle, wherein once R&D inputs have led to technological progress, technological progress wins a certain market share, and, with market share, there is finally profit; and only with profit is it possible to provide feedback on the R&D inputs. If this kind of virtuous cycle encounters an international technology constraint, such as a chip constraint, which prevents our industries from upgrading, the cycle will come to a halt."
Industrial Structure Upgrading Requires Forming an “Innovation-Scale” Virtuous Cycle,"Tsinghua People's Bank of China School of Finance (PBCSF) , Ju Jiandong","May 17, 2022","Let us suppose that an intermediate link in our “innovation-scale” becomes stuck. For example, our market share is cut off and it becomes impossible to achieve technological progress and industrial upgrading. Whether it’s the United States’ technological containment of Japan in the 1980s or the containment of China in China-U.S. trade disputes, we find that the United States’ containment policy has two characteristics: first, it hits leading enterprises that dare, and are able, to challenge a U.S. technological monopoly, such as Huawei; second, it maintains U.S. monopolies in world (including China) core technology markets and blocks the paths to Chinese technological upgrades."
Industrial Structure Upgrading Requires Forming an “Innovation-Scale” Virtuous Cycle,"Tsinghua People's Bank of China School of Finance (PBCSF) , Ju Jiandong","May 17, 2022","We’ve said that our industries need upgrading. Of all our chips, the best is Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation’s 14-nanometer. Can they rise to the next levels by progressing to 10 nanometers? 7 nanometers? I’m afraid they can’t because there’s no market. China’s chip market is dominated by the United States. So long as you don’t challenge U.S. technological hegemony, China’s mobile phone enterprises can import U.S. chips. So the upgrading path forward for China’s high-end chips is cut off because all these mobile phone enterprises in the middle use U.S. chips."
Industrial Structure Upgrading Requires Forming an “Innovation-Scale” Virtuous Cycle,"Tsinghua People's Bank of China School of Finance (PBCSF) , Ju Jiandong","May 17, 2022","So I’ll pose this question: in the case of a civilian product, if your technology is relatively backwards such that even the Chinese domestic market won’t buy it—there’s no domestic market—how do you upgrade the technology? The United States is, on the one hand, hitting out at the lead enterprises while, on the other hand, it is realizing U.S. monopolies in technology markets. These two core tricks break our industrial upgrading cycle."
Industrial Structure Upgrading Requires Forming an “Innovation-Scale” Virtuous Cycle,"Tsinghua People's Bank of China School of Finance (PBCSF) , Ju Jiandong","May 17, 2022","How do you break out of the containment by international giants? I’d like to offer an opinion, which you are all welcome to criticize and correct. If we don’t break international technology’s monopoly over the Chinese market to make China’s technological upgrading possible, China’s technological innovations and industrial upgrading will be impossible to achieve. As for breaking the international technology monopoly, whatever measures are taken, it will definitely be necessary to cultivate domestic technological competitiveness, and domestic technological competitiveness definitely requires ensuring a certain market share—ensuring that the market share of foreign core technologies does not exceed 70%. Chinese technology must have at least a 30% share of the Chinese market. I call this the “policy to counter international technology containment.”"
Industrial Structure Upgrading Requires Forming an “Innovation-Scale” Virtuous Cycle,"Tsinghua People's Bank of China School of Finance (PBCSF) , Ju Jiandong","May 17, 2022","I’ll give an example. Let’s say we have a brand called Little Fruit Mobile. To ensure that 30% of the chip market downstream is a domestic technology market, it is necessary to start from downstream mobile phones. If, in keeping with the requirement, 30% of the Little Fruit Mobile phones use Chinese chips, then there’s no problem. If less than 30% of the Little Fruit Mobile phones use Chinese chips as required, then there will have to be a punitive tax."
Industrial Structure Upgrading Requires Forming an “Innovation-Scale” Virtuous Cycle,"Tsinghua People's Bank of China School of Finance (PBCSF) , Ju Jiandong","May 17, 2022","To give an example, if products using Chinese chips are less than 30%, such that the domestic chip use rate is greater than 20%, but less than 30%, a 20% punitive tax would be collected; if greater than 10%, but less than 20%, then a 50% tax would be collected; if less than 10%, then the tax would be 100%; if less than 5%, the tax would be 400%. For example, a mobile phone like Apple’s that does not use any Chinese chips would be subject to a four hundred percent tax. If they wanted to sell phones in the Chinese market, they would have to guarantee that 30% of their products were using Chinese chips. But this causes a problem. The Little Fruit phones using imported chips would be higher quality and more expensive, while the quality of phones using Chinese chips would be relatively poor, in which case one could consider lowering the price down to two thousand, for example—even lowering it below cost. In this situation, the state would have to provide a subsidy to ensure a 10% profit rate for manufacturers of phones using Chinese chips."
Industrial Structure Upgrading Requires Forming an “Innovation-Scale” Virtuous Cycle,"Tsinghua People's Bank of China School of Finance (PBCSF) , Ju Jiandong","May 17, 2022","This is an initial suggestion. I believe that, at the moment for the upgrade of China’s industries it is especially important to break through international technology containment, which, in reality, means a 30% import substitution for core technologies. I suggest that we invest two trillion RMB annually over the next 10 years to ensure that the foreign technology share of the Chinese market does not exceed 70% to promote technological upgrading of China’s industries. In this way, we can drive the upgrading of China’s industries from the front and thereupon promote China’s GDP growth, contributing an additional 1% of growth."

Japan’s growth rate was 6.8%. Four years later, Japan’s growth rate had dropped to 0.84%. If we fail to achieve industrial upgrading, it will be very hard to ensure the healthy growth of our nation’s economy. These are the opinions I have to offer. Thank you!"
Is China Forcing the U.S. Toward “Strategic Clarity” in Its Taiwan Policy?,"Aisixiang , Liu Zhaojia","Aug 15, 2022","From a historical perspective, August 2022 is sure to be a major turning point in Sino-U.S. relations with respect to the Taiwan issue. In August, China took two decisive actions after U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi insisted on visiting Taiwan despite angry condemnations from Beijing. The Chinese People’s Liberation Army successfully conducted an unprecedented large-scale military exercise around the entire island of Taiwan. This provided ample proof that the mainland has the ability to completely blockade Taiwan or recapture Taiwan by force, while simultaneously preventing the United States and Japan from rushing to Taiwan’s rescue with military aid. Immediately after this event, Beijing issued a white paper entitled The Taiwan Question and China’s Reunification in the New Era. In the white paper, Beijing reiterated its preferred policy of achieving national unity through peaceful means, which it has constantly advocated. However, Beijing also warned that it would resort to non-peaceful means if necessary. Together, the military exercises and the white paper demonstrate that reunification by any means necessary is the nation’s primary goal, and that China will unswervingly strive to bring this goal to fruition, regardless of the costs."
Is China Forcing the U.S. Toward “Strategic Clarity” in Its Taiwan Policy?,"Aisixiang , Liu Zhaojia","Aug 15, 2022","Before these major actions, there had always been some element of “strategic ambiguity” in Beijing’s policy toward Taiwan, namely, Beijing’s refusal to state its preferred date for national reunification. Beijing simply vowed to resort to the strategy of reunification by force only if Taiwan were to declare de jure independence in addition to de facto, or in the event foreign armed forces had entered the island. The military exercises and white paper have largely done away with Beijing’s “strategic ambiguity.” Instead, by adopting a policy of “strategic clarity,” Beijing has deliberately and unequivocally declared that it will not wait indefinitely for Taiwan’s return to China. Instead, it has officially launched a national reunification plan, in the hope of accelerating the national reunification process through political negotiations between the two sides on the details of the “one country, two systems” policy. Beijing has emphatically stated that, if peaceful reunification fails, non-peaceful reunification will occur. At the same time, Beijing has left it an open question whether the favorable conditions of the “one country, two systems” policy that the mainland has previously offered to Taiwan will still apply if national reunification is achieved primarily by force."
Is China Forcing the U.S. Toward “Strategic Clarity” in Its Taiwan Policy?,"Aisixiang , Liu Zhaojia","Aug 15, 2022","China’s “strategic clarity” policy has more or less altered its “passive” or “defensive” stance of the past, and China has now seized the initiative on the Taiwan issue. So far, the final model of China’s reunification, whether peaceful or non-peaceful, actually depends on the manner and intensity of the United States’ response to China’s initiatives. It cannot be denied that the final decision taken by the United States will have a decisive impact on the attitude of Taiwan residents towards national reunification."
Is China Forcing the U.S. Toward “Strategic Clarity” in Its Taiwan Policy?,"Aisixiang , Liu Zhaojia","Aug 15, 2022","Following the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States in 1979, the United States adopted a policy of “strategic ambiguity” on the Taiwan issue. The rapid rise of China and its designation as a “strategic threat” by the United States have, to a considerable extent, changed the United States’ view of Taiwan’s strategic value. Henceforth, because Taiwan can become an ally of the United States in containing and weakening China’s policies, a permanently divided China is in the national interest of the United States. Even so, the United States has not made it clear that, in the event of a Chinese “invasion” of Taiwan, the United States will come to the rescue of Taiwan militarily. Instead, it has always pursued a policy of “strategic ambiguity,” leaving China uncertain as to whether the United States will start a war with China over the Taiwan issue. For the United States, the purpose of “strategic ambiguity” is that it is a less costly strategic approach to prevent China from pursuing reunification by non-peaceful means."
Is China Forcing the U.S. Toward “Strategic Clarity” in Its Taiwan Policy?,"Aisixiang , Liu Zhaojia","Aug 15, 2022","In my opinion, one important reason for adopting the policy of “strategic ambiguity” is that, according to international law and international agreements, the United States has no moral right or legal basis to intervene in cross-strait affairs. As pointed out in the white paper, the “One China” principle has been embodied in international documents such as the Cairo Declaration in 1943, the Potsdam Declaration in 1945, and the UN General Assembly Resolution 2758 in 1971. Taiwan is an indivisible part of China and the central content of the “One China” principle. This “One China” principle was also endorsed by three Sino-U.S. joint communiques in 1972, 1979, and 1982. In all these communiques, the United States expressed “acknowledgment” (承认) or “recognition” (认识到) of China’s position that there is only one China and that Taiwan is a part of China. In addition, in the 1979 Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations between the People’s Republic of China and the United States of America, the United States recognized the government of the People’s Republic of China as the sole legitimate government of China. In conclusion, all international declarations or proclamations and bilateral agreements between China and the United States clearly state that there is only one China, that this China is the People’s Republic of China, that Taiwan is an indivisible part of the People’s Republic of China, and that the government of the People’s Republic of China is the sole legitimate government of China. Therefore, the assertion in the white paper that “the One China principle is the general consensus of the international community and in accord with the basic norms of international relations” is correct. The white paper said that “The world only has one China, the historical and legal facts that Taiwan is a part of China cannot be doubted, and the status of Taiwan, which has never been a country but a part of China, cannot be changed” is also correct."
Is China Forcing the U.S. Toward “Strategic Clarity” in Its Taiwan Policy?,"Aisixiang , Liu Zhaojia","Aug 15, 2022","However, in pursuing a strategy to permanently divide China in order to contain and weaken China, U.S. leaders and officials have opted to slyly contend that the United States has only “acknowledged” or “recognized” but has not “accepted” (接受) the position of the People’s Republic of China, namely that Taiwan is part of China. They deceitfully try to use domestic legal instruments, such as the Taiwan Relations Act of 1980 [translator’s note: correct year of this act is 1979] and the sinister “Six Assurances” to Taiwan, as the legal basis for U.S. policy toward Taiwan, placing it above international law. This hollows out the “one China” principle, denies that Taiwan is part of the People’s Republic of China, treats Taiwan as an independent political entity and a “protectorate” of the United States, and threatens China not to use force to achieve national reunification."
Is China Forcing the U.S. Toward “Strategic Clarity” in Its Taiwan Policy?,"Aisixiang , Liu Zhaojia","Aug 15, 2022","However, none of these legal tricks employed by the U.S. are widely recognized by the international community, only by its few hardcore allies. Therefore, if the United States abandons its “strategic ambiguity” policy and makes a commitment to defend Taiwan militarily, this would violate international law. The United States would be condemned by most countries for interfering in China’s internal affairs and criticized as violating the sovereignty of an independent country (China) and thereby violating the provisions of the United Nations Charter. A policy of “strategic clarity” will cause the United States to face accusations of lawlessness, hegemony, and hypocrisy from countries around the world, leaving it isolated in the international community."
Is China Forcing the U.S. Toward “Strategic Clarity” in Its Taiwan Policy?,"Aisixiang , Liu Zhaojia","Aug 15, 2022","The reason that the United States chose the policy of “strategic ambiguity” is also very likely due to the fact that, even though China was not as powerful as the United States, they could not predict how the Soviet Union would respond and the United States did not want to start a war with China that would lead to a U.S.-Soviet conflict. As China becomes more powerful militarily, it is unclear whether the United States could achieve a decisive victory at a tolerable cost in a hot war with China. Therefore, the policy of “strategic ambiguity” allows the United States to minimize the chance of war with China. Today, if the United States was to start a war with China in its own territory, the odds that the United States would be able to defeat China are becoming increasingly slim."
Is China Forcing the U.S. Toward “Strategic Clarity” in Its Taiwan Policy?,"Aisixiang , Liu Zhaojia","Aug 15, 2022","In recent years, faced with China’s constantly growing military influence and strength, the voices in the United States calling for the United States to change to a policy of “strategic clarity” are growing louder and louder. Writing in the 2020 issue of Foreign Affairs, Richard Haass and David Sacks say, “To defend its achievement and continue to deter Chinese adventurism, the United States should adopt a position of strategic clarity, making explicit that it would respond to any Chinese use of force against Taiwan. Such a policy would lower the chances of Chinese miscalculation, which is the likeliest catalyst for war in the Taiwan Strait.” U.S. Senator Bob Menendez is one of two sponsors of the provocative Taiwan Policy Act of 2022. The bill explicitly recognizes Taiwan as a “major non-NATO ally.” In August, the senator wrote in The New York Times that “the United States needs less ambiguity to guide our approach to Taiwan. In today’s world — with Mr. Xi’s China — a robust and credible deterrence to preserve peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait requires clarity in word and deed.”"
Is China Forcing the U.S. Toward “Strategic Clarity” in Its Taiwan Policy?,"Aisixiang , Liu Zhaojia","Aug 15, 2022","Since U.S. President Joe Biden took office, he has repeatedly said inadvertently that, if Taiwan is “invaded” by China’s military, the United States will send troops to defend Taiwan. However, after each time Biden speaks, his officials rush to reiterate that the United States’ “One China” policy has not changed. It should be said that the United States has continued to maintain its position of “strategic ambiguity” to date. However, in recent years, the United States has continued to provoke China on the Taiwan issue, so it seems to intend to gradually do away with its position of “strategic ambiguity.”"
Is China Forcing the U.S. Toward “Strategic Clarity” in Its Taiwan Policy?,"Aisixiang , Liu Zhaojia","Aug 15, 2022","Today, China has taken the initiative in Taiwan affairs and adopted a policy of “strategic clarity.” With the ball now in the U.S. court, China’s bold and decisive actions have surprised and shocked the United States, putting it in a dilemma and a painful situation. In this new situation, the policy of “strategic ambiguity” is no longer tenable. Its continuation will shake and worry the United States, its allies, and its partners, especially those allies and partners in the so-called “Indo-Pacific” region. They will see the United States as weak, wavering, and untrustworthy. Residents of Taiwan will feel that the United States is an unreliable “protector” and will therefore be less resistant to the “one country, two systems” model that would facilitate China’s peaceful reunification of the country. On the other hand, if the U.S. adopts a policy of “strategic clarity” and vows to take military action against China if it attempts to seize Taiwan by force, this would not only plunge the United States into a war between great powers that it would be difficult to win and would exact a heavy toll, but it will also cause the United States to discover that the allies and partners in the international network it leads are reluctant to endorse and follow its dangerous policies toward China. Even more seriously, a Sino-U.S. war could evolve into a nuclear war and a world war."
Is China Forcing the U.S. Toward “Strategic Clarity” in Its Taiwan Policy?,"Aisixiang , Liu Zhaojia","Aug 15, 2022","In the final analysis, although Taiwan is indisputably a huge strategic asset for the United States, it is not among the core interests of the United States, so Americans will not be willing to shed a great deal of blood to defend Taiwan. However, on the other side, Taiwan is tied to national sovereignty, security, territorial integrity, prestige, dignity, and honor in the eyes of the Chinese people. For the Chinese people, trampled down by Western and Japanese imperialism for more than a century, Taiwan is a highly emotional issue. As the white paper passionately exclaims: “Solving the Taiwan issue and realizing the complete reunification of the motherland is the common will of all Chinese sons and daughters, an inevitable requirement for realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and the unswerving historical task of the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people have made long-term and unremitting efforts to this end.”"

The actions taken by the United States in the days ahead, especially its handling of the Taiwan Policy Act of 2022, will provide a good indication of the United States’ intentions toward the reunification of China and world peace."

The Resolution sums up the rich connotation of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era in the “Ten Clarifications,” takes “leading the great social revolution with great self-revolution” as an important content, and profoundly reveals that self-revolution and social revolution go hand in hand and promote one another. The dialectical relationship of co-progress fully reflects the historical initiative of the Chinese Communists to consciously transform the subjective world while transforming the objective world, so as to better transform the objective world. General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that the courage to self-revolution is a distinctive symbol of our party’s difference from other political parties, and it is also the key to the Party’s longevity. Blacksmithing must be hard on its own: Adhere to and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics as our party must have the courage to carry out self-revolution. The spirit of self-revolution is a strong support for the Party’s governing ability. We must adhere to the unity of integrity and innovation, strengthen and improve ourselves with the spirit of reform and innovation, and continue to open up the future through reforming the old and making new ones. Comprehensively and strictly governing the Party is an inherent requirement of self-revolution. We must always maintain the self-awareness of facing the problem and the courage to turn inward. We must take anti-corruption as a major political task that the Party’s self-revolution must grasp for the long term. General Secretary Xi Jinping’s strategic thinking on leading the great social revolution with great self-revolution, inheriting and developing the Marxist theory of party building, and profoundly summarizing the Party’s historical experience, especially the practical experience of comprehensively and strictly governing the Party in the new era, demonstrates the original mission, political responsibility, and historical consciousness of the Chinese Communists, and has profound ideological connotations and great value for the times."

However, there may be differences between the acquirer of the existing assets and the acquired enterprise in terms of business ideas and management systems and methods, resulting in adaptation costs and cost of trust for both parties. Under the greenfield development model, enterprises can choose appropriate geographic locations for investment and have high controllability of capital investment and expenditures, but development cycles are long and operational risks are high.

With low-cost financing abroad and investment in overseas transmission and distribution regulatory assets, SGID’s overseas businesses have gained stable income and realized a virtuous cycle with “both ends of the business overseas.” Power and gas transmission and distribution are natural monopolies enabled by economies of scale. In mature overseas markets, regulatory mechanisms based on revenue cap or price cap models are adopted in the energy transmission sector, so pricing is transparent and reasonable. After caps are set on the annual revenue or regulatory tariff of transmission companies, such companies can lower their expenditures below predicted values by improving internal operational efficiency, etc., which will in turn enhance their actual return on net assets, and the regulatory revenue will also be adjusted along with changes in inflation rates. Under mature investment environments and industry policies of overseas markets, SGID can make the most of SGCC’s comparative advantages in technology, operations, and talent to reduce costs and increase efficiency, thereby achieving stable operating income from overseas investments."

Third, the relationship between Russia and the United States and the West deteriorates further, the Ukrainian government uses a local conflict to transfer domestic conflicts intensified by rising energy prices, and Russia is forced to copy the “Crimea model,” using a referendum to promote the Donbas region’s independence or even “incorporation into Russia.” Fourth, with the intensification of domestic conflicts and political turmoil in Ukraine, Russia supports the complete occupation of Donbas by the armed forces in the east and southeast of the country and encourages the secession of Ukraine’s eastern and southeastern oblasts, leading to the dismemberment of Ukraine. Fifth, there will be global reconstruction, that is, Russia and NATO launch a full-scale confrontation, one result being that Donbas and even all of Ukraine will be incorporated into Russia."

From January 10 to 13, Russia held an intensive dialogue with the United States and NATO on a range of security issues, including the situation in Ukraine and NATO’s eastward expansion, and presented Russia’s security concerns and vision for European security at a special meeting of the Permanent Council of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). However, Russia’s core concerns, such as its clearly drawn “red lines” and proposed principle of “indivisibility of security,” were ignored by the United States and NATO. The United States and NATO have shifted the focus of the security dialogue from the political to the military-technical sphere, raising specific issues such as the resumption of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty, limiting military exercises and deployments, increasing the transparency of exercises, and resuming diplomatic missions between Russia and NATO."

"New Changes in the Sino-Indian Security Dilemma, and Their Consideration","South Asian Studies Quarterly , Liu Siwei","Sep 21, 2020","Since 2000, Sino-Indian security interaction has been characterized by instability. On one hand, security interaction between China and India has increased. Being aware of the importance of managing their security relationship, both countries have intensified their efforts to consult on some security issues and have attempted to build cooperative relationships in some areas. On the other hand, the relationship has also shown tensions from time to time, with a series of specific incidents that have caused setbacks in the interactive relationship, particularly the Doklam standoff in 2017 and the Galwan Valley conflict in June 2020. The Sino-Indian security relationship has attracted a great deal of scholarly attention. Some scholars have used the security dilemma theory to interpret it, maintaining that a security dilemma is at the root of tensions and instability in the bilateral relationship. The academic community has also intensified research on the Sino-Indian security dilemma. For example, in 2019, the journal Asian Security put out an issue with exploring the security dilemma and China-India relations as the research topic.1 In addition, there have been a number of domestic and international research results in this area, including the 2002 article The Security Dilemma in Sino-Indian Relations written by Professor John Garver.2 India-China Maritime Competition: The Security Dilemma at Sea (Rajesh Basrur et al. eds.) has examined the Sino-Indian “security dilemma” at sea.3 Ajey Lele, meanwhile, has assessed the Sino-Indian security dilemma in space.4 Admittedly, there are also some scholars who say that “security dilemmas” are not suitable for explaining Sino-Indian interaction. Some experts argue that security dilemmas have not played a role in Sino-Indian relations, noting that relations between China and India are characterized not by security dilemmas but by conflicting interests and are influenced by changes in their domestic politics and factors in the international strategic environment.5 Some scholars even argue that the emphasis on the Sino-Indian security dilemma is somehow a Western bias and a trap.6 Do China and India face a security dilemma? If so, what level of security dilemma do China and India currently face, and what is new about it compared to the traditional security dilemma? How can China and India alleviate the current security dilemma and build a compatible security relationship? This paper argues that the 70-year-old Sino-Indian relationship has gone through different stages, and while the security dilemma has not been evident at every stage, and has not been of uniform severity, it nonetheless exists in the relationship. This paper examines the new manifestations and features of the current Sino-Indian security dilemma and explores the new factors affecting the security dilemma. On that basis, ideas and suggestions are put forward for alleviating the security dilemma."
"New Changes in the Sino-Indian Security Dilemma, and Their Consideration","South Asian Studies Quarterly , Liu Siwei","Sep 21, 2020",I. New Manifestations and Features of the Sino-Indian Security Dilemma
"New Changes in the Sino-Indian Security Dilemma, and Their Consideration","South Asian Studies Quarterly , Liu Siwei","Sep 21, 2020","The concept of a “security dilemma” (安全困境 or 安全两难) first appeared in the paper Idealist Internationalism and the Security Dilemma by John H. Herz. 7 A security dilemma refers to a situation where a country takes measures such as increasing armaments in order to guarantee its own security, but instead reduces the security of other countries, thereby leading to further insecurity for the country itself, so that it falls into an inextricable predicament. There are different theoretical interpretations of the causes of such security dilemmas. Neorealism believes that “military preparedness” security dilemmas are a structural feature inherent in international politics under conditions of anarchy.8 John Hertz, for example, argues that the ultimate source of security dilemmas is the lack of a “higher authority” in anarchy and that the immediate cause of security dilemmas is the uncertainty of nations and their mutual fear of harm in a state of anarchy. 9 Constructivism argues that “security dilemmas are a product of social constructs.” 10 Other scholars emphasize psychological factors. Robert Jervis, for example, suggests that “perceptions” and “misperceptions” in relations between states are the main causes of security dilemmas.11 There is currently no unified criterion for examining whether there is a security dilemma in a bilateral relationship. This paper agrees with the following criteria proposed by Harvard University professor Alastair Iain Johnston in assessing whether a security dilemma exists between the United States and China. First, each side ignores the cooperative behavior of the other while magnifying the non-cooperative behavior of the other.12 Second, both sides increasingly ignore the interactive nature of the relationship, that is, each side believes that the other side is solely responsible for the deterioration of the relationship, whereas the bilateral relationship is maintained thanks to the efforts of both sides. Both sides see their own moves as clearly contributing to stability.13 Third, one side is increasingly concerned that the other side will become a status quo-changing state or is increasingly skeptical of the effectiveness of the current strategy.14"
"New Changes in the Sino-Indian Security Dilemma, and Their Consideration","South Asian Studies Quarterly , Liu Siwei","Sep 21, 2020","Examining Sino-Indian relations since 2000 based on the above criteria, we find the security dilemma to be more clearly manifested in this period, especially in the interaction between the two sides surrounding the border dispute issue. As is well known, the Sino-Indian border issue is very complex. Both sides have been negotiating and consulting on the border issue, but have never found an effective solution to the dispute. At the same time, the actions of both countries in the border area, especially those related to defense, have caused varying degrees of concern to the other side. In recent years, moreover, both sides have increased infrastructure construction and resource development activities in border areas, causing speculation about the other side’s underlying true intentions. This kind of uncertainty about the intentions of the other side has in turn generated feelings of suspicion and insecurity on both sides and has even led to a “spiral pattern” of animosity. One can say that the security dilemma has plagued interaction between the two countries around the border issue for many years. It is worth mentioning that, although the border crisis incidents between the two countries in recent years, including the tent standoff in 2013, the Doklam crisis in 2017, and the standoff on the western section of the Sino-Indian border in 2020 (which triggered the Galwan Valley conflict) were not entirely caused by the security dilemma, it was undoubtedly one of the most important contributing factors. The two countries also have different interpretations of this, with the Indian side preferring to pin the blame on the Chinese side. For example, some Indian scholars have said that China’s rise and its growing military might have exacerbated the Sino-Indian security dilemma. As the scholars note, a long time after the 1962 war, India’s military posture along the India-China border was essentially defensive and could be described as exerting ‘denial and deterrence.’ Over the past decade, however, China’s trajectory, coupled with the rapid modernization of its military, has made people question the validity of this approach. India now feels more vulnerable in the face of China’s growing military power on land and at sea. This intensification of the security dilemma has led to a corresponding transformation of India’s military strategy toward China into one of “punitive deterrence.” 15 Admittedly, the Chinese side believes that the current dilemma has been caused to a large extent by the actions of the Indian side. For example, some Chinese experts have pointed out that the Doklam standoff was actually triggered by India’s serious misinterpretation of normal production and livelihood activities in China’s border areas.16 The interpretations mentioned above, in which each side holds the other responsible for the deterioration of bilateral relations, also precisely illustrate the existence of the Sino-Indian security dilemma. Moreover, the Sino-Indian security dilemma has taken a new turn and has taken on new characteristics since the start of the new century."
"New Changes in the Sino-Indian Security Dilemma, and Their Consideration","South Asian Studies Quarterly , Liu Siwei","Sep 21, 2020","First of all, the Sino-Indian security dilemma shows a spillover character. A spillover character mainly refers to where a security dilemma is no longer limited to specific areas, such as border issues, but has begun to spread to more areas, such as maritime security, nuclear security, space security, and even many non-traditional security areas."
"New Changes in the Sino-Indian Security Dilemma, and Their Consideration","South Asian Studies Quarterly , Liu Siwei","Sep 21, 2020","The maritime security dilemma between China and India, which has gradually come to the fore since 2000, is undoubtedly the most illustrative case of the spillover character of the security dilemma between the two countries. Although there are different assessments in academic circles of the intensity of the Sino-Indian maritime security dilemma, the fact that it has become increasingly evident in the course of maritime interaction between the two countries is indisputable. India’s perception of the threat from China is growing, and domestic rhetoric about the “Chinese maritime threat” has begun to increase, including the strategic community’s hype in recent years concerning China’s “String of Pearls” strategy in the Indian Ocean. India has also begun to ramp up investment in its maritime forces, including upgrading its naval, coast guard, and air forces, especially in the Lakshadweep Islands off India’s west coast and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands to the east, to better monitor and project power far from the coast.17 In addition, India has taken a number of actions to strengthen its military presence in the Indian Ocean, including the deployment of facilities with military intent in the relevant littoral nations. For example, India has reached an agreement with Seychelles to establish a naval base on Assumption Island (Assumption Island Naval Base), constructed a new coastal surveillance radar network in the Indian Ocean (the New Coastal Surveillance Radar Network CSRS) 18, and reached reciprocal military logistical support agreements with the United States, France, Australia, and Japan.19 Although these actions are not exclusively directed at China, their intent to address the Chinese threat is clear. Similarly, China’s strategic suspicions and threat perceptions of India have grown along with India’s accelerated naval modernization, increased maritime defense cooperation with the United States, Japan, and Australia, and its emphasis on “eastward operations” into the Western Pacific, as well as its activities in the South China Sea. Indeed, both countries have been adjusting their maritime security strategies and maritime security roles since the turn of the century, and this kind of adjustment has made it difficult for them to be sure of each other’s strategic intentions. Although their respective maritime power commitments and naval buildups are not exclusively directed at each other, China and India’s perceptions of security threats from each other have increased as their maritime power has grown and as their maritime operations have increased. This also makes them somewhat prone to the mistaken belief that their maritime security interests are incompatible, particularly in the Indian Ocean."
"New Changes in the Sino-Indian Security Dilemma, and Their Consideration","South Asian Studies Quarterly , Liu Siwei","Sep 21, 2020","In addition, it is worth noting that apart from the traditional security dilemma characterized by its military nature, a resource security dilemma between India and China characterized by its “non-military nature” has also begun to emerge. Non-traditional security threats are security challenges that transcend national boundaries and sovereignty, and are characterized by resource-based tensions and conflicts, the fundamental feature of which is their “non-force-based nature.”20 Therefore, non-traditional security threats often lead to “resource-based” security dilemmas, i.e., where the growth of resource use and protection in one country leads to shortages of resources in another country.21 Such non-military security dilemmas between the two countries have begun to increase as large numbers of complex and volatile non-traditional security issues enter into the China-India interaction. Moreover, the complexity of the interaction between the two countries is heightened by the fact that some non-traditional security issues are intertwined with traditional security issues. Take the water security dilemma, for example. Global water resources are under increasing pressure due to climate change and growing consumption, and China and India are no exceptions. In India’s view, given China’s location at the headwaters of India’s major rivers, China could use water as a weapon to threaten India’s security in the future. In recent years, India has been very concerned about China’s upstream river water development. India’s fears have not been allayed, although the two countries have signed a memorandum of understanding for bilateral sharing of hydrological information on the Yarlung Tsangpo River, 22 and they have also established an expert-level mechanism to cooperate on cross-border river hydrological flood reporting and emergency incident management and to exchange views on other issues of mutual concern.23 In addition, the fact that water resource issues are also intertwined with the border issue between the two countries increases the complexity of issues, so the development of water resources in disputed areas, for example, is more likely to trigger a security dilemma. In recent years, India’s water resource development activities in the disputed areas have given rise to concerns and worries on China’s part. Some scholars have noted that India’s water resource development initiatives in areas disputed by China and India have a huge negative impact on China’s peripheral security.24"
"New Changes in the Sino-Indian Security Dilemma, and Their Consideration","South Asian Studies Quarterly , Liu Siwei","Sep 21, 2020","Secondly, the security dilemma is characterized by dynamic disequilibrium. That is, the intensity of the security dilemma in the development process of Sino-Indian relations changes dynamically and is even characterized by disequilibrium in the same period, showing different intensities in different areas. At present, the Sino-Indian security dilemma is most apparent in the area of border interaction, where the intensity is highest and a trend toward spiraling escalation is evident. The frequency of border frictions between the two countries has increased significantly in recent years. This is also influenced to some extent by the growing security dilemma. Although the two countries have adopted a series of new measures for border crisis management, including the establishment of various new mechanisms for dialogue and consultation, such as the Sino-Indian border affairs consultation and coordination mechanism added in 2012, the security dilemma between the two countries has not really been alleviated. With the strengthening by both countries of defense and infrastructure construction in border areas, together with increased uncertainty in the domestic and international environments facing both countries, the Sino-Indian border security dilemma is developing in a serious direction."
"New Changes in the Sino-Indian Security Dilemma, and Their Consideration","South Asian Studies Quarterly , Liu Siwei","Sep 21, 2020","Similarly, the Sino-Indian maritime security dilemma is also characterized by dynamic change. At the beginning of the new century, the maritime security dilemma between the two countries was at a relatively low intensity. Their two navies conducted a series of joint maritime search and rescue exercises, such as the “Dolphin 0311” exercise in 2003 and the “China-India Friendship 2005” exercise in 2005, but the dilemma has intensified in the past decade. Overall, however, it is still at a low-to-moderate intensity and has not entered a serious spiral of hostility. The security dilemma has nonetheless affected maritime engagement between the two countries and hindered bilateral cooperation, including non-traditional security cooperation at sea on counter-terrorism and anti-piracy. It is worth noting that there is a risk that the maritime security dilemma between the two countries will develop in a serious direction in the future. As some scholars believe, although the outbreak of war is still far away, the Sino-Indian maritime rivalry seems to be continuing.25 Admittedly, if both sides can take appropriate measures, the security dilemma may also ease somewhat in the future."
"New Changes in the Sino-Indian Security Dilemma, and Their Consideration","South Asian Studies Quarterly , Liu Siwei","Sep 21, 2020","Changes have also begun to appear in security dilemmas in many other areas, with varying directions and processes of change. Overall, the intensity of Sino-Indian dilemmas in non-traditional security areas is weaker than in traditional security areas, and it is also easier for the two countries to take some steps to alleviate the corresponding dilemmas in those areas. In addition, Sino-Indian dilemmas in some new areas, such as space security, are also still only at low-to-medium intensity. As Ajay Lele points out in his assessment of the Sino-Indian space security dilemma, both countries have invested in space over the past few decades for social, scientific, commercial, and military reasons. Both countries are pursuing programs such as navigation network development and missions to the Moon and Mars. But India and China’s space security dilemma is currently seen as suggestive rather than certain.26 It is worth noting that although security dilemmas manifest themselves with varying intensity in different areas, they are in fact intertwined and influence each other. For example, the intensification of the Sino-Indian border security dilemma will, to a certain extent, trigger an intensification of the maritime security dilemma."
"New Changes in the Sino-Indian Security Dilemma, and Their Consideration","South Asian Studies Quarterly , Liu Siwei","Sep 21, 2020","Finally, the security dilemma is characterized by asymmetry. This characteristic is manifested mainly in asymmetry in the threat perception intensity and sensitivity of the two sides to mutual threats within the same security dilemma. Overall, India’s perception of threats from China is stronger in intensity and sensitivity than China’s perception of threats from India. This asymmetry is reflected in the official reports and other documents published by the two sides involving their respective defense and national security strategies. Since 2000, the need to guard against threats from China has been clearly expressed in the annual reports of the Indian Ministry of Defense and in a number of official documents dealing with maritime military and maritime security strategy issues. For example, the Indian Defense Ministry’s 2008-2009 annual report suggests that China’s military modernization process must be “carefully monitored” because it involves India’s defense and security.27 China’s defense white papers, however, rarely explicitly state the need to address India’s military threats. While the 2019 white paper China’s National Defense in the New Era mentioned that “China’s homeland security still faces threats and land border disputes have not yet been completely resolved,”28 which addresses the Indian factor, the report did not explicitly discuss the Indian threat. The asymmetry is also reflected to some extent in relevant public opinion surveys. A 2016 Pew survey, for example, showed that 69 percent of Indian respondents believed that China’s growing military power posed a threat to India, with 46 percent of them considering it a serious threat.29 In contrast, a recent Chinese domestic public opinion poll on India-China relations showed that only 30.9 percent of respondents agreed that India’s military power posed a threat to China, and nearly 60 percent disagreed.30 Of course, this may be the overall security threat perceptions of the two sides and does not say much about the actual situation in specific areas. Nonetheless, studies reveal that an asymmetry in threat perceptions between India and China does indeed exist in various areas, although the asymmetric difference varies by area. In the border security area, for example, the asymmetric difference may be relatively small compared to those in the maritime security and nuclear security fields."
"New Changes in the Sino-Indian Security Dilemma, and Their Consideration","South Asian Studies Quarterly , Liu Siwei","Sep 21, 2020","Moreover, asymmetric threat perceptions between India and China are plainly evident in many non-traditional security areas as well, including the water security area mentioned above. It is also worth noting that India’s sense of insecurity is currently stronger than China’s in terms of the false sense of incompatibility between the two countries’ security strategies that stems from economic competition. China’s “Belt and Road” initiative is seen by India as eroding its regional influence, while China’s cooperation with Indian Ocean littoral states on infrastructure construction is viewed by India as a “string of pearls” operation to contain India. Former Indian foreign secretary Shyam Saran has said, “I have no doubt that the biggest challenge to India comes from the rise of China. China will seek to reduce India’s strategic space by infiltrating India’s neighborhoods, and that is what we’re seeing with all of the subcontinent’s neighbors.”31 India has taken many initiatives in recent years to increase its regional influence, including upgrading its “eastward” policy to “eastward action,” participating in Iran’s Chabahar project to develop India’s Central Asian trade routes32, jointly sponsoring the “Asia-Africa Growth Corridor” (AAGC) with Japan, and attaching importance to cooperation in the Bay of Bengal region. China has also begun to pay attention to projects initiated by India and tends to believe that the joint initiatives by India and Japan (such as the India-Japan “Asia-Africa Growth Corridor,” and the India-Japan-Australia “production chain alliance” idea in preparation recently) have some offsetting effect on China. Overall though, China’s threat perception and sensitivity toward India is lower than India’s threat perception toward China. China even calls for China and India to link up on relevant projects, and advocates “China-India plus” cooperation."
"New Changes in the Sino-Indian Security Dilemma, and Their Consideration","South Asian Studies Quarterly , Liu Siwei","Sep 21, 2020",II. New Factors Affecting the Sino-Indian Security Dilemma
"New Changes in the Sino-Indian Security Dilemma, and Their Consideration","South Asian Studies Quarterly , Liu Siwei","Sep 21, 2020","The root cause behind the formation of the Sino-Indian security dilemma was structural, namely, the anarchic state of the international community. As mentioned above, however, the security dilemma has not been constant in intensity over the course of development of Sino-Indian relations, and has shown a dynamic nature. The academic community does not have a uniform indicator of the variables that affect the intensity of security dilemmas. Some scholars have focused on five different variables: power (relative military capability), offensive-defensive balance, offensive-defensive distinction, the motivations of states themselves, and perceptions of the motivations of others.33 The above variable factors have undoubtedly also had their effects on the changes in intensity seen in the Sino-Indian security dilemma since 2000, but they will not be detailed here. This study focuses on several new contributing factors, including external actors, i.e., third-party factors and new domestic factors."
"New Changes in the Sino-Indian Security Dilemma, and Their Consideration","South Asian Studies Quarterly , Liu Siwei","Sep 21, 2020","First, there are factors involving external actors. As some scholars have mentioned, the influence of external actors on interstate relationships of trust is often overlooked in security dilemma theory. In fact, alliance and coalition relationships can play an important role in security dilemmas.34 According to Barry Posen, support from allies or potential allies can significantly worsen security dilemmas or even trigger spirals.35 Facts have also shown that China and India’s threat perceptions of each other are often linked to third-party factors. As the two countries’ interaction in regional and global security networks has grown, Sino-Indian relations have long gone beyond bilateral relations and are increasingly influenced by other actors, i.e., third-party factors. At present, the United States is undoubtedly the most important third-party factor influencing the Sino-Indian security relationship. Since 2000, the United States and India have taken a number of initiatives to improve bilateral relations, especially defense relations, including the signing of the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement and the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement. The two sides are also reportedly on track to sign a Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement for Geospatial Intelligence (BECA). Although India has many interests to consider in developing relations with the United States and has not positioned itself as a U.S. ally, the many U.S. initiatives to use India to contain China, the continuously growing “quasi-allied” defense cooperation between India and the United States, and the increasing number of joint naval exercises, have indeed raised Chinese security concerns and increased China’s threat perception toward India. Similarly, U.S.-China interaction has also affected India’s security perceptions to some extent. China’s actions to increase its defense forces in response to U.S. threats have also proven to increase India’s insecurity to varying degrees, leading it to adopt countermeasures. This has been the case, for example, with the two countries’ interaction in the nuclear security area."
"New Changes in the Sino-Indian Security Dilemma, and Their Consideration","South Asian Studies Quarterly , Liu Siwei","Sep 21, 2020","In addition to the U.S. factor, countries such as Japan and Australia are also becoming important third parties influencing Sino-Indian security interaction. It is worth noting that in South Asia, in addition to Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh are also beginning to become third-party factors influencing Sino-Indian relations. At present, third-party factors have rather complex effects on the interaction between the two countries, with both positive and negative aspects, but some such factors play a new role in promoting security dilemmas as well as influencing the intensity of security dilemmas. As some scholars have commented, the geopolitical game with third-party factors at its core is a serious disruption to the bilateral relationship. On one hand, any progress in the development of relations between India’s neighbors and China will irritate India’s geo-sensitive nerves to varying degrees. On the other hand, any moves by forces outside the region to draw India into containing China will also trigger China’s suspicions as to India’s “strategic autonomy.”36 Indeed, given the current international security landscape, especially in the Indo-Pacific region, which is undergoing new adjustments and changes, as well as the instability of Sino-Indian relations, third-party factors may increase uncertainty in the bilateral relationship. This in turn raises the risk of misperceptions and miscalculations, thereby inducing new security dilemmas or contributing to the original security dilemma’s development in a serious direction."
"New Changes in the Sino-Indian Security Dilemma, and Their Consideration","South Asian Studies Quarterly , Liu Siwei","Sep 21, 2020","Second, there are new domestic factors. Some new developments in current domestic politics in India and China are also emerging as new factors affecting the security dilemma. For example, while it is not yet possible to precisely assess the extent to which rising domestic nationalist sentiment in both countries is affecting the security dilemma, this kind of influence should be considered certain, especially in the area of border security interactions. For example, because reconciliation and concessions can easily be perceived as acts of weakness, both sides find it more difficult to initiate conciliatory concessions after a border crisis arises. Moreover, it seems that nationalist sentiments are now starting to spread to the economic sphere, which not only affects economic and trade cooperation between the two countries, but also may easily induce a false sense of incompatibility between the two sides in the security arena. India has recently taken security protection-oriented measures against relevant Chinese companies, including an announcement by India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology banning several Chinese apps on national security grounds. Although China has not introduced reciprocal countermeasures, and according to relevant research data, 46.1 percent of Chinese respondents support future cooperation between India and China in the economic sphere despite India’s unfriendly initiatives,37 these measures have aroused varying degrees of concern and apprehension on the Chinese side. It is worth mentioning that economic and trade cooperation has been considered a stable cornerstone of Sino-Indian relations for many years, and although the scale of economic and trade cooperation between the two countries is not as large as that between China and the United States and Japan, both China and India are important emerging economies and are also thought to have broad prospects for cooperation. In fact, total bilateral trade between China and India is growing year by year. The total value of trade between China and India in 2019 was RMB 639.52 billion, up 1.6 percent year-on-year.38 However, the competitive aspect of the current economic relationship between China and India is also increasingly prominent and has even been exaggerated. As some scholars have commented, there are increasing calls within India to catch up with and surpass China. This has led to fierce competition with China over economic growth rates, which is manifested in many areas such as international commodity markets, international investment markets, and international labor markets.39 Indeed, studies have shown that competition in the economic sphere is liable to generate hostile projections of negative images of ethnic exclusivity, and creates a spiral of illusory incompatibility and imagined hostility based on the pursuit of prestige and honor.40"
"New Changes in the Sino-Indian Security Dilemma, and Their Consideration","South Asian Studies Quarterly , Liu Siwei","Sep 21, 2020","In addition, the media, think tanks, and academic communities of both countries have also increased their focus on Sino-Indian relations in recent years. With the development of the internet and new media, moreover, these actors have more channels for influencing interactions between the two countries, including shaping security discourse and influencing public opinion. At present, the impact of these actors on the Sino-Indian security dilemma can be twofold. That is, they can play a positive role in alleviating the security dilemma, and can also become catalysts promoting it. What is of concern, however, is that the chances of the latter occurring have increased in recent years. Take the media, for example: Both Chinese and Indian media have increased their attention to many security issues, including border issues, but sometimes the impact of specific incidents and the resulting security threats are exaggerated due to fragmented interpretations and even disinformation and inaccurate reporting, which can easily induce a so-called “imaginary security dilemma” on both sides. Similarly, the think tank and academic communities in both countries can influence bilateral security interactions in their own unique ways. At present, there is no way to accurately assess the extent to which they have played a role in alleviating or promoting the security dilemma. However, the author’s review of Chinese and Indian statements on the Sino-Indian strategic relationship since 2000 reveals that while the diplomatic levels of both countries favor positive language to describe and build the bilateral relationship, at the strategic and academic levels, there has been an increase in the use of competitive and even confrontational terms in recent years in both Indian and Chinese statements. In Indian strategic circles in particular, the “Chinese security threat theory” has long existed, and has even become a rhetorical habit. This sort of rhetorical habit no doubt tends to make the other actor feel insecure and take measures to counter it, ultimately leading to a deterioration of its own security41, which may induce a security dilemma."
"New Changes in the Sino-Indian Security Dilemma, and Their Consideration","South Asian Studies Quarterly , Liu Siwei","Sep 21, 2020",III. Future Ways Out of the Sino-Indian Security Dilemma
"New Changes in the Sino-Indian Security Dilemma, and Their Consideration","South Asian Studies Quarterly , Liu Siwei","Sep 21, 2020","The security relationship between India and China has changed considerably since 2000, and many factors have affected this security relationship, including the “security dilemma.” Although security dilemmas do not necessarily generate conflict, and as Robert Jervis and other scholars have pointed out, they are not at the core of all conflicts, their negative impact on bilateral interaction is nonetheless clear. As of now, the Sino-Indian security dilemma remains at a low-to-moderate intensity in many areas and has not entered a serious spiral of hostility, but it still runs the risk of moving in a serious direction, especially over the border issue. If left unchecked and unmanaged, it could enter a hostile spiral scenario that could lead to tragic consequences. Both countries need to continue working hard on alleviating the security dilemma. In light of the new changes in the Sino-Indian security dilemma, both countries should contemplate and explore new ways and paths to alleviate the security dilemma."
"New Changes in the Sino-Indian Security Dilemma, and Their Consideration","South Asian Studies Quarterly , Liu Siwei","Sep 21, 2020","The severity of the security dilemma can indeed be moderated by physical and material factors (e.g., technology, geography) and psychological and perceptual factors (e.g., misunderstandings),42 but alleviating the security dilemma is no easy task. In fact, China and India have taken a number of steps in the new century to try and mitigate the security dilemma, including through the signing of confidence-building measures and memoranda of understanding to reduce mutual tensions. China and India have also established many security interaction mechanisms of different forms and natures, ranging from comprehensive dialogue mechanisms, such as the defense consultation mechanism and the strategic dialogue mechanism, to mechanisms for addressing specific issues, such as the mechanism for meetings of special representatives on the Sino-Indian border issue, the working mechanism for consultation and coordination on border affairs, and the mechanism for joint counterterrorism exercises.43 In addition, China and India have begun to actively use multilateral mechanisms such as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization for bilateral interaction. Such security interaction mechanisms, especially the mechanism established after the Doklam crisis for informal meetings between the leaders of the two countries, have provided a dialogue platform for strategic communication between China and India, and have played a positive role in alleviating the security dilemma. Overall, however, although the relevant measures have achieved certain results, the existing measures are still insufficient for addressing the current new situation and new changes, and the two countries still need to explore new ways to deal with the security dilemma. For now, the two sides can consider focusing on the following areas:"
"New Changes in the Sino-Indian Security Dilemma, and Their Consideration","South Asian Studies Quarterly , Liu Siwei","Sep 21, 2020","First, actively exploring new paths and measures for mitigating the border security dilemma remains a priority. The standoff between the two sides in the western section of the Sino-Indian border has continued for several months since early May 2020. Although neither country wants the situation to get out of hand, the crisis occurred during the COVID-19 epidemic, which added new uncertainties to managing the crisis, including the psychology of fear brought about by the epidemic, the blockage of many regular communication channels, and the interference of third factors. The border crisis has also reignited nationalist sentiments in both countries, which is not only detrimental to the resolution of the current crisis but may even induce the security dilemma between the two sides to enter a serious spiral of hostility, increasing the risk that policymakers will misjudge the situation. Therefore, it is of the utmost urgency to continue to strengthen border security dialogues, carry out new confidence-building measures, and improve crisis management. Considering the impact of the epidemic, both sides need to consider creating some new mechanisms for communication and dialogue, such as the Cloud Security Strategic Dialogue meetings. Moreover, these kinds of communication and dialogues should not be limited to the official level, but should also include Track 1.5 dialogues, as well as Track 2 exchanges such as academic community and think tank community exchanges. For example, the academic and think tank communities can conduct exchanges and dialogues on how the two sides should carry out new confidence-building measures, how to optimize crisis management, and other topics, and contribute new solutions."
"New Changes in the Sino-Indian Security Dilemma, and Their Consideration","South Asian Studies Quarterly , Liu Siwei","Sep 21, 2020","Second, the two countries should attach importance to the current security dilemma’s new features, especially its spillover character, and to the security dilemmas that exist in other areas outside the border security field, and should pay attention to their new dynamics, especially in the case of the maritime security dilemma. Although at present the maritime security dilemma between the two countries does not appear to be of high intensity, there is still a risk that it will develop in a serious direction in the future as the modernization of their navies and the construction of their maritime forces continue to advance. Furthermore, in recent years, both countries have attempted to play the “leading role” in the field of maritime connectivity in the Indo-Pacific region, and this great power competition over interests and prestige may further strengthen each other’s security strategy concerns. The two countries should strengthen their maritime security dialogue and try their best to avoid actions that over-irritate each other, especially on sensitive issues. Although the two countries have established a dialogue mechanism for maritime cooperation, at present it mostly involves diplomatic officials from the two sides, and in the future, it could be suggested that naval officers from both countries also participate in it. In addition, it is also very important for China and India to conduct more exchanges and dialogues in areas such as nuclear security, space security, and cybersecurity. Given the asymmetry in threat perception between the two sides in these areas, bilateral or multilateral exchanges and dialogues could allow each side to better understand the other’s security concerns and avoid unhealthy competition."
"New Changes in the Sino-Indian Security Dilemma, and Their Consideration","South Asian Studies Quarterly , Liu Siwei","Sep 21, 2020","Third, both sides should pay a high level of attention to various new factors that induce security dilemmas, and be particularly vigilant against third-party interference factors. As of now, third-party involvement increases uncertainty in Sino-Indian relations and undermines the integrity of the information each side possesses, reducing the predictability of the bilateral relationship. In addition to promptly strengthening information exchanges and communication in order to reduce mutual misunderstanding and suspicion due to third-party factors, both sides need to guard against active third-party interference in their bilateral relations as much as possible. Both countries can also take appropriate measures to turn unfavorable factors into favorable ones, such as expanding more “China-India plus” cooperation. New domestic triggers likewise deserve the attention of both sides, especially the growing nationalist sentiment in their respective countries. In addition to assessing bilateral relations rationally, both sides should take a more tolerant view of the fact that the other side is rising, and refrain as much as possible from challenging each other’s strategic bottom lines and core security interests. Given that actors such as the media, think tanks, and academic communities have become important players influencing bilateral relations, it is important for both countries to continue to resume and promote relevant exchange programs, including media exchanges, think tank dialogues, and academic exchanges, so as to enhance mutual understanding. Although it would be difficult for these people-to-people exchange programs to achieve the goal of mitigating the security dilemma directly, they can play a positive role in dispelling negative emotions and easing the tense atmosphere in the bilateral relationship."
"New Changes in the Sino-Indian Security Dilemma, and Their Consideration","South Asian Studies Quarterly , Liu Siwei","Sep 21, 2020","Fourth, it is also very important for the two countries to update their security concepts. That is, to abandon the old zero-sum game security concept as much as possible and embrace cooperative security concepts that place greater emphasis on mutual trust, mutual benefit, and equality. In fact, in addition to security dilemmas, the two countries also face many existential problems that plague not only individual countries but all of humanity, including ecological degradation, climate warming, water resource shortages, and epidemic diseases. For example, in the era of globalization, geographic borders between countries are ill-suited to completely stop the spread of viruses like COVID-19, H1N1, Ebola, and SARS. In the face of these challenges, if the traditional security perspective, or zero-sum game thinking, is still adopted to view and deal with problems, it will not only lead to the obstruction of relevant cooperation but may even lead to so-called non-traditional security dilemmas. Therefore, if both sides can update their concepts and use cooperative security concepts to manage and conduct security interaction between the two countries, it may be easier for both countries to extricate themselves from the current security dilemma and achieve the transformation of Sino-Indian security relations from the security dilemma mode to the cooperative security mode of interaction."
"New Changes in the Sino-Indian Security Dilemma, and Their Consideration","South Asian Studies Quarterly , Liu Siwei","Sep 21, 2020",Conclusion
"New Changes in the Sino-Indian Security Dilemma, and Their Consideration","South Asian Studies Quarterly , Liu Siwei","Sep 21, 2020","Although the “security dilemma” has had different manifestations at different stages in the Sino-Indian relationship, it has always accompanied the development of relations between the two countries, and its proper understanding and handling by both sides is directly related to the development of Sino-Indian relations. At present, the Sino-Indian security dilemma in the new era presents new features, including a spillover character, dynamic disequilibrium, and asymmetry. To some extent, the two countries are facing a compound security dilemma that has both traditional military security dilemmas and non-military, non-traditional security dilemmas. They face real security dilemmas and are also confined by imagined security dilemmas. The root cause behind the formation of the Sino-Indian security dilemma was structural, namely, the anarchic state of the international community. However, it has not been constant in intensity over the course of development in Sino-Indian relations and has shown dynamic variation under multiple influencing factors. Although there are no indicators at present to accurately estimate the severity of the security dilemma, the bilateral interaction process, and its results show that while the severity of the Sino-Indian security dilemma has not yet reached a high intensity in many areas, the border security dilemma is developing in a serious direction. Both countries need to pay attention to the new changes in the security dilemma and explore new ways to alleviate it, including actively alleviating the border security dilemma, such as by optimizing border crisis management, launching new confidence-building measures, and trying to create some cloud-based dialogue mechanisms suitable for the epidemic period. Both countries should also actively pay attention to the changes in the security dilemma in other security areas and rationally control the new contributing factors affecting the security dilemma, especially third-party factors. Currently, third-party factors are changing the equation of Sino-Indian interaction, and this will make it more difficult to alleviate the dilemma. Both sides need to make good use of positive factors and prevent negative ones. Finally, it is important for both sides to update their security concepts. If both sides can make greater use of cooperative security concepts to manage and conduct security interaction between the two countries, it may be easier for them to get out of the current security dilemma."
New Meanings and Predicaments of the Biden Administration’s Indo-Pacific Strategy,"China-US Focus , Zhao Minghao","Mar 2, 2022","The Biden Administration’s Indo-Pacific strategy has taken on new meanings. However, seeing as the Biden administration has adopted the Democratic Party’s version of the “America First” line, the credibility and appeal of its Indo-Pacific economic strategy is fundamentally limited. China need not overreact to Biden’s Indo-Pacific strategy report, but it does need to prepare now for a trend that will persist for a long time, namely an all-out effort by the United States to return to and manage the Indo-Pacific. Some specific issues raised in this report and the new tricks that the United States is using to pressure China demand our close attention."
New Meanings and Predicaments of the Biden Administration’s Indo-Pacific Strategy,"China-US Focus , Zhao Minghao","Mar 2, 2022",The Biden administration published the Indo-Pacific strategy report against the background of an increasingly severe Ukraine crisis and very tense U.S.-Russian relations. This act was an attempt to put on display the White House’s total control over foreign policy and the U.S. resolve to return to the Indo-Pacific region. The report states that the United States has been an “Indo-Pacific power” for more than 200 years and that it will steadfastly anchor itself in the Indo-Pacific.
New Meanings and Predicaments of the Biden Administration’s Indo-Pacific Strategy,"China-US Focus , Zhao Minghao","Mar 2, 2022","This is the first U.S. Indo-Pacific strategic report published under the White House name. It embodies the Biden administration’s intention to seize dominance over the Indo-Pacific against a background of comprehensively intensifying strategic competition with China. The emergence of “Indo-Pacific” as a geopolitical concept is closely tied to the U.S. search for ways of suppressing the rise of China. High-ranking U.S. officials began discussing the “Indo-Pacific” in a big way under Obama. In 2017, the Trump administration officially put forward the “Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy,” and the U.S. Department of Defense published a special Indo-Pacific strategy report in June 2019."
New Meanings and Predicaments of the Biden Administration’s Indo-Pacific Strategy,"China-US Focus , Zhao Minghao","Mar 2, 2022",The new meanings of the Biden administration’s Indo-Pacific strategy differ from the past in four main areas:
New Meanings and Predicaments of the Biden Administration’s Indo-Pacific Strategy,"China-US Focus , Zhao Minghao","Mar 2, 2022","First, it further increases the importance of the Indo-Pacific strategy by linking it to the alignment of the great powers centered on the international order. The report states that the Indo-Pacific should not be viewed solely from the narrow perspective of great power geopolitical competition, but rather that the Indo-Pacific situation should be seen as “defining the basic nature of the international order.” The Biden administration has continued the Trump administration’s “Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy” policy tagline, but is also emphasizing the need to realize “connectivity, prosperity, security, and resilience” in the region. The report states that the trends of the next 10 years will be “decisive” for the Indo-Pacific. This reveals the Biden administration’s sense of urgency over strategy deployment and implementation."
New Meanings and Predicaments of the Biden Administration’s Indo-Pacific Strategy,"China-US Focus , Zhao Minghao","Mar 2, 2022","Second, in advancing its Indo-Pacific strategy, the Biden administration is working to highlight the fact that it is on the same wavelength as its allies and partners. The report lays out Indo-Pacific-related policy concepts from Japan, India, Australia, the UK, and the EU in a major effort to exaggerate the consistency and interconnections between the U.S. vision for the Indo-Pacific and that of its allies and partners. The report states that the Biden administration will build a “a latticework of strong and mutually reinforcing coalitions” and create a “collective capacity” against its opponent, namely China. The United States will still advance its security strategy centered on “integrated deterrence” by integrating allies and partners into a “defense supply chain” and pushing forward with cooperation in defense S&T. An aspect of the report that merits close attention is its clear mention of the fact that the United States will encourage the EU and NATO to strengthen relations with the Indo-Pacific region: It will “help build bridges between the Indo-Pacific and the Euro-Atlantic.”"
New Meanings and Predicaments of the Biden Administration’s Indo-Pacific Strategy,"China-US Focus , Zhao Minghao","Mar 2, 2022","Third, the Biden administration is working hard to repair the “economic weak link” of its Indo-Pacific strategy. U.S. economic policy tools in this region were weakened by the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. In October 2021, the Biden administration put forward the concept of an “Indo-Pacific economic framework.” This report stated that a detailed scheme concerning this concept would be introduced in the first half of this year and that it would touch upon multiple areas such as the digital economy and supply chain security. According to the report, the Biden administration, together with its allies and partners, will build a “diverse, open, and predictable” supply chain, expand joint investments centered on decarbonization and clean energy, and put forward a new “digital economy framework.” The Biden administration will also make the Indo-Pacific an important region for implementing the “Build Back Better World” (B3W) initiative, with a particular emphasis on building digital (i.e., 5G) infrastructure."
New Meanings and Predicaments of the Biden Administration’s Indo-Pacific Strategy,"China-US Focus , Zhao Minghao","Mar 2, 2022","Fourth, the Biden Administration has given its Indo-Pacific strategy a stronger ideological coloring. The Biden administration has emphasized the need to strengthen domestic democratic governance in the relevant countries and then to uphold Indo-Pacific “freedom” from the inside out. By means of initiatives such as the Open Government Partnership, the United States will support relevant countries when it comes to safeguarding election security, maintaining media independence, developing civil society, and countering economic coercion. The report also mentions the need to oppose “external interference” and “information manipulation” by countries such as China and Russia in Indo-Pacific nations. The implementation in the Indo-Pacific of the first United States Strategy on Countering Corruption will be another important move by the Biden administration. According to the report, the United States will dedicate itself to raising “fiscal transparency” in the countries of the Indo-Pacific. In addition, the United States will expand activities of organizations such as the Peace Corps in the Indo-Pacific. It will reinforce U.S. soft power through such approaches as establishing quadrilateral mechanism fellowships and implementing the Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative."
New Meanings and Predicaments of the Biden Administration’s Indo-Pacific Strategy,"China-US Focus , Zhao Minghao","Mar 2, 2022","The sections of the Biden administration’s Indo-Pacific strategy report that concern China try to put the “bully” label on China, falsely stating that China “bullies” and “economically coerces” the countries concerned—that it makes comprehensive use of economic, diplomatic, military, and technical forces to establish a “sphere of influence” in the Indo-Pacific. At the same time, the report states that the United States hopes to responsibly manage competition with China. Its objective is “not to change China, but to shape the strategic environment in which China operates, establishing a balance of influence in the world that is maximally favorable to the United States and its allies.” This is the first time that U.S. officials have used the phrase “balance of influence” to elucidate U.S. policy towards China. It differs in a subtle but important way from the usual “balance of power.”"
New Meanings and Predicaments of the Biden Administration’s Indo-Pacific Strategy,"China-US Focus , Zhao Minghao","Mar 2, 2022","Alarmingly, the Biden administration has made it even clearer that it is placing the Taiwan issue within the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategic framework. The report mentions Taiwan or the Taiwan Strait a total of seven times. Moreover, it describes the Taiwan region as an important partner in the Indo-Pacific—an equal to India, Indonesia, Singapore, and Malaysia. The report says the following: “We will also work with partners inside and outside of the region to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, including by supporting Taiwan’s self-defense capabilities, to ensure an environment in which Taiwan’s future is determined peacefully in accordance with the wishes and best interests of Taiwan’s people.” This is a new formulation of the Biden administration in relation to its Taiwan policy and shows that the United States intends to reinforce the role of the Taiwan region in its Indo-Pacific strategy, thus giving impetus to the “internationalization” of the Taiwan issue."
New Meanings and Predicaments of the Biden Administration’s Indo-Pacific Strategy,"China-US Focus , Zhao Minghao","Mar 2, 2022","The Biden administration manifests its resolve to advance the Indo-Pacific strategy by especially listing in this report the important policies that the United States will adopt over the next two years. However, the challenges facing the Biden administration are also very noticeable. The report exaggerates the U.S. domestic political consensus regarding Indo-Pacific policy, for the Republican Party does not wish to provide support to Biden’s efforts to promote “climate resilience” and infrastructure construction among Indo-Pacific nations. Even within the Biden administration, there exist relatively major disagreements between the foreign policy team and the economic policy team centered on such matters as an Indo-Pacific digital trade agreement."
New Meanings and Predicaments of the Biden Administration’s Indo-Pacific Strategy,"China-US Focus , Zhao Minghao","Mar 2, 2022","Clearly, the Biden administration has adopted the Democratic Party’s version of the “America First” line, and its rejection of free trade agreements out of fear of losing votes fundamentally limits the credibility and appeal of its Indo-Pacific economic strategy. A White House official claimed that the approval of the U.S. Congress would not be sought for the “Indo-Pacific economic framework.” This is a reflection of the resistance to Biden’s rule and will make the relevant countries doubtful of the sustainability of Biden government policies."
New Meanings and Predicaments of the Biden Administration’s Indo-Pacific Strategy,"China-US Focus , Zhao Minghao","Mar 2, 2022","China need not overreact to this Indo-Pacific strategy report by the Biden administration, but it does need to prepare now for a trend that will persist for a long time, namely an all-out effort by the United States to return to and manage the Indo-Pacific. Some specific issues raised in this report and the new tricks that the United States is using to pressure China demand our close attention. For example, the “economic coercion” hyped up by the United States aims to reinforce an understanding of “Chinese coercion” among the relevant countries, but this also reminds China of the need to continuously optimize its methods of using economic measures to bring about diplomatic objectives."
New Meanings and Predicaments of the Biden Administration’s Indo-Pacific Strategy,"China-US Focus , Zhao Minghao","Mar 2, 2022","In addition, the Biden administration is continually creating new policy tools in areas such as the digital economy, cybersecurity, advanced technology, and high-standard infrastructure, is trying to use the so-called problems of “corruption,” “maritime security,” and “illegal fishing” to put pressure on the Belt and Road Initiative, and, by expanding the activities of the U.S. Coast Guard in the Asia-Pacific region, is striking back at China’s protection of its own rights upon the seas. These trends present new problems and trials for China’s foreign policy towards its neighbors."

Faced with an overall environment of dilemmas in its internal development and the deterioration of the external security environment, there is a tendency for Europe to want to demonstrate its independence by “showing strength” externally. Since the new European Commission took office, it has focused on developing strategic sovereignty, and the EU and its member states have been responding with adjustments in the trade, S&T, competition, industrial, digital, and climate protection fields, among others. They are committed to boosting their raw material and supply chain resilience, as well as diversifying trade partners, and have launched a series of new strategies, including the “Indo-Pacific Strategy.” In terms of China policy, Europe is increasingly emphasizing an “institutional adversary” positioning in its perception of China. It is currently adjusting its strategy towards China, and some of its policy positions may be hardening. China-EU relations are becoming increasingly complex, with the challenges increasing significantly and uncertainties rising."

The Report of the 20th National Congress of the CCP mentions several times the need to coordinate development and security. On one hand, it puts forward the New Development Concept, and deploying high-quality development under the new development pattern; on the other, it systematically explains the national security system under the guidance of the Overall National Security Concept. Many of these policy orientations, including ensuring food security, improving the resilience and security level of production chains and supply chains, accelerating the achievement of high-level S&T self-reliance and self-improvement, and conducting original and leading S&T research based on national strategic requirements, share a common language with Europe’s thinking on strengthening S&T sovereignty.

Faced with the changes in the world, the times, and history, China has adjusted relevant aspects of its strategic layout, and has established a new development pattern in which the domestic great circulation plays the leading role and the dual (domestic and international) circulations promote each other. In the new situation, a key focus of international public opinion is on how to adhere to the development direction of economic globalization and the basic state policy of opening up to the outside. In the Report of the 20th Party Congress, China responded to the “decoupling theory,” which some foreign media are clamoring for, with a principled position of high-level opening up to the outside. It hopes to create an international environment conducive to development and a diversified and stable international economic structure by steadily expanding the convergence of interests, building global partnerships based on equality, openness, and cooperation, expanding institutional openness, continuously improving the quality and level of the international circulation, and jointly cultivating new drivers of global development. There is no doubt that high-level opening up to the outside will also bring more policy dividends to future China-EU relations."
"On Coordinating Development and Security, China and Europe Speak the Same Language","Global Times , Wu Huiping","Nov 9, 2022","At present, the Russia-Ukraine conflict is posing serious challenges to Europe, leading it to face multiple difficulties such as regional war, rising prices, and energy supply tensions. In the face of this changing and chaotic situation, Europe should shift its mindset, get rid of the Cold War mentality, show strategic foresight, and achieve ideological independence. China is committed to building a pluralistic, balanced, and interdependent international structure, advocates upholding the basic norms of international relations, and welcomes the development of Europe into an important stabilizing force in a multipolar world. China and Europe are important trade partners. They have already established a multi-faceted, broad, and multi-level comprehensive strategic partnership, and there is still potential for deepening high-level cooperation. For example, German automotive companies are strengthening their integration with the Chinese innovation system, which can also promote the transformation from “Made in China” to “Created in China.” In green and digital fields especially, although the development plans of China and Europe have their own focus, their strategic agendas are highly compatible. Europe has established green transformation and digital transformation as its priority strategic agenda, hoping that the modernization and transformation of the economy and society in the future will be permeated with and led by green change and digitalization. In the “green” field, it plans to use the green development concept to leverage policy innovation in various domains such as the energy, transportation, and manufacturing industries, and strives to become the first continent in the world to achieve carbon neutrality. In the digital field, it has issued digital strategies, artificial intelligence white papers, cybersecurity strategies, and other digital development strategies, and formulated a series of laws, regulations, standards, and norms. At the same time, China has also made the green and digital directions major components of its economic and social development planning, and the Report of the 20th Party Congress reaffirmed the promotion of “green development” and acceleration of “digital China” construction."
"On Coordinating Development and Security, China and Europe Speak the Same Language","Global Times , Wu Huiping","Nov 9, 2022","In the current complex and changing international environment, China and Europe can not only contribute their own wisdom and solutions to the modernization process, but should also adhere to the positioning of a comprehensive strategic partnership. On a foundation of basic consensus on many issues such as multilateralism, international cooperation, and multipolarity, they should maintain strategic communication, build trust and dispel doubts, jointly address global and international challenges, continuously explore new growth drivers, raise their level of cooperation, and use a robust China-EU relationship to inject more certainty, security, and development momentum into the world."
"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","In the context of the intensified competition between China and the United States, the increasing downward pressure on the domestic economy, and the continuous impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, whether there is a period of strategic opportunity for China’s development has become a puzzle for many people.1 In this regard, the communiqué of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th CCP Central Committee in 2020 and the 14th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development of the People’s Republic of China and the Outline of Vision 2035 in March 2021 clearly pointed out that the current and future periods are still periods of important strategic opportunities for China’s development but that there are new developments and changes in both opportunities and challenges. This follows the notion raised by the CCP Central Committee in 2002 that “the first two decades of the 21st century, for China, is an important period of strategic opportunities that must be firmly grasped for making great achievements.” Once again, this prompts major strategic research and judgment on China’s development environment in the new era and puts forward higher requirements for China’s development and foreign exchanges in the future. Analyzing the origin, status quo, and trend of the “period of strategic opportunity” in the new era is of great practical significance for understanding the current internal and external environments facing China, and it is also a valuable guide for advancing the next round of deepening reform and comprehensive opening up."

"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","Chinese Communists have always had rich experience and great practice in identifying and seizing strategic opportunities.2 From accurately judging the overall situation, reversing the strategic situation, and finally winning victory in the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the War of Liberation, seizing contradictions between the United States and the Soviet Union and achieving strategic breakthroughs in the early days of the founding of New China, and excelling at grasping and taking advantage of strategic opportunities, it has always been the key for the Chinese Communists to assess the situation and make progress in their careers at a historical juncture."
"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","Since the end of the Cold War, the CCP Central Committee’s thinking on strategic opportunities in the domestic and foreign environments can be roughly divided into three periods."
"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","The first is the period of a spark of insight for the research and judgment of the “period of strategic opportunity.” In the early 1990s, with the disintegration of the Soviet Union, China’s reform, opening up, and modernization drive were at a new major historical juncture, and changes in domestic and foreign situations were elusive. Deng Xiaoping reviewed the current situation from a new historical height and made important expositions. In March 1990, Deng Xiaoping said in a conversation with a responsible comrade of the Central Committee: “There are many contradictions in the world… There are contradictions that we can take advantage of. There are favorable conditions for us. There are opportunities. The question is how we grasp them.”3 He also noted that there would be an era of peace in the world and an absence of a new world war, saying “… we must firmly grasp the center of economic construction and do not lose this opportunity… we must take advantage of the opportunity to develop China.”4 In December 1990, Deng Xiaoping once again put forward the idea of “making good use of opportunities to solve development problems,” saying that “the situation at home and abroad is better than we expected… if this is maintained for 50 or 60 years, socialist China will be invincible.”5"
"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","Deng Xiaoping’s thoughts on “opportunity” and “occasions” and accurate analysis of the actual situation at home and abroad have had a profound impact on the convening of the 14th Party Congress and the opening of a new situation of socialist modernization. In October 1992, the report of the 14th Party Congress clearly pointed out: “Now the domestic conditions are in place, the international environment is favorable, there are both challenges and opportunities, and it is a good time for us to speed up our development.”6 By accurately judging the international situation and the stage characteristics of China’s domestic development, the CCP Central Committee formulated correct guidelines for foreign relations and domestic development policies and has continued to promote China’s rapid economic growth in the next three decades, the rapid improvement of people’s living standards, and the rapid rise of comprehensive national strength and international status."
"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","The second is the period of policy formation for the research and judgment of the “period of strategic opportunity.” On May 31, 2002, Jiang Zemin first proposed the concept of a “period of strategic opportunity” in his speech at the Party School of the CCP Central Committee. In November of that year, the report of the 16th Party Congress officially adopted the formulation of “an important period of strategic opportunity” in a central document for the first time: “Looking at the overall situation, the first two decades of the 21st century are an important period of strategic opportunity where we can live and make a difference.”7 Since then, the central decision-making level has continued to use this formulation, and the emphasis on the seriousness of internal and external challenges has been continuously strengthened.8 The report of the 17th Party Congress in 2007 stated: “The opportunities are unprecedented, and challenges are also unprecedented, though the opportunities outweigh the challenges… We must seize and make good use of important strategic opportunities, be realistic and pragmatic, forge ahead, continue to build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way and accelerate socialist modernization, and complete our noble mission as entrusted by the times.”9 In 2010, the Fifth Plenary Session of the Seventeenth CCP Central Committee further pointed out: “Based on a comprehensive assessment of the international and domestic situation, China’s development is still in a period of important strategic opportunities that can make great achievements, facing both rare historical opportunities and many foreseeable and unforeseeable risks.”10"
"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","The cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era, and the research and judgment of the “important period of strategic opportunity” have not changed, but the emphasis on “opportunity awareness and risk awareness” has increased significantly. The report of the 18th Party Congress in 2012 emphasized: “We must accurately judge the changes in the connotation and conditions of the important period of strategic opportunity, fully grasp the opportunity, deal with the challenge calmly, win the initiative, gain the advantage, and win the future.”11 The 2014 Central Economic Work Conference continued, clearly emphasizing: “The judgment that China’s development is still in a period of important strategic opportunities that can make great achievements has not changed. What has changed is the connotation and conditions of the important period of strategic opportunity.”12 In October 2015, in the face of profound and complex changes in the international and domestic environment, General Secretary Xi Jinping once again clearly pointed out at the Fifth Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee: “Although the international and domestic environments have undergone profound and complex changes, our significant judgment to develop important occasions for strategic opportunity has not changed.”13"
"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","Entering the second decade of the 21st century, the CCP Central Committee has deeply realized that the internal and external conditions and environments faced by the “important period of strategic opportunity” have produced many influencing variables that may be unfavorable to China’s development, and China has also nurtured and accumulated a large number of new development advantages. China’s development has long faced a dialectical relationship between “crisis” and “opportunity,” “internal” and “external” coordination, “disaster” and “blessing,” and “competition” and “integration.” Such expressions appear frequently in the documents of the CCP Central Committee. It can be seen that the strategic opportunity after the “first 20 years of the 21st century” has become an important topic of the CCP Central Committee. In October 2017, the report of the 19th Party Congress pointed out: “China’s development is still in an important period of strategic opportunity, the prospects are very bright, and the challenges are also very severe.”14 In May 2019, General Secretary Xi Jinping once again clearly pointed out in his speech when he chaired a symposium on the rise of the central region: “China is still in an important period of strategic opportunity for development, but the international situation it faces is increasingly complex. We must be soberly aware of the long-term and complex nature of various unfavorable factors at home and abroad and be properly prepared to deal with various difficult situations.”15 The prefix “still” before the “period of strategic opportunity” reflects the fact-seeking and calm strategic determination of the CCP Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, as well as the strategic perseverance for long-term continuation of domestic and foreign policies."
"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","The third is the period of maintenance and extension of the research and judgment of the “period of strategic opportunity.” In 2020, at the end of the “first 20 years of the 21st century,” how to “maintain and extend the period of important strategic opportunity for China’s development” will be put on the agenda.16 The communiqué of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th CCP Central Committee added a temporal adverb to this statement for the first time, clearly stating: “At present and in the future, China’s development is still in an important period of strategic opportunity, but there are new developments and changes in both opportunities and challenges.”17 In March 2021, the 14th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development of the People’s Republic of China and the Outline of Vision 2035 adopted the same expression in the communique of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th CCP Central Committee through policy planning. This shows that in the view of the CCP Central Committee, at least until 2035, the “important period of strategic opportunity” will exist for a long time."
"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","According to the book Questions and Answers on the Study of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, the CCP Central Committee reached this basic judgment from the perspectives of both the international and domestic environments: “From the perspective of the external environment, there is an important basis for making this basic judgment… Although the international environment is increasingly complex, overall, things are still in our favor. Time and momentum are on our side.” “From the perspective of China’s development, there is a solid foundation for making this basic judgment… The solid material foundation, abundant human capital, broad market space, huge development potential, and significant institutional advantages are the firm foundation for China’s development at present and in the future important period of strategic opportunity.”18"
"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","It can be seen that from inspiration, finalization, and extension, the research and judgment of the “period of strategic opportunity” reflect the keen observation of the internal and external current situations, the sense of anxiety about the status quo, and the forward-looking thinking since the reform and opening up. This has played a crucial role in the formulation of China’s development strategy and the formulation of expected goals.19"
"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","The understanding of the “period of strategic opportunity” is not only related to the overall situation of China’s development, but also to the success or failure and to the future and destiny of the socialist cause. It is precisely based on the accurate judgment, comprehensive grasp, and precise borrowing of the “period of strategic opportunity” that China can analyze favorable factors in the volatile, difficult, and complex international situation since the 1990s. This is how China can catch favorable trends from the drastic changes in Eastern Europe, the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the rise of the Asia-Pacific, and the containment of the United States and other international changes and explore the development momentum that has improved the national economy and people’s livelihood and promoted rapid growth from the new generation of S&T revolution."
"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","The problem is that in recent years, facing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic growth has slowed, China-U.S. conflicts have intensified, and some executive departments and local governments have gained absolute and mechanized control of “risk” and “safety.” Such factors have weakened many people’s confidence in future investment and development prospects. In December 2021, the Central Economic Work Conference clearly stated that China’s economic development is facing the “triple pressure” of demand contraction, supply shock, and weakening expectations. Of these, “weakening expectations” stems from people’s concerns about changes in the domestic and foreign environments. With the United States positioning China as its “biggest strategic competitor,” international “China threat” theories and “China responsibility” theories have emerged one after another, and the “triple pressure” of domestic economic development has increased, some people began to doubt whether the “period of strategic opportunity” still exists. Some even believe that the “important period of strategic opportunity” has ended ahead of schedule.20 Therefore, to deeply understand and widely disseminate the “important period of strategic opportunity” that still exists in the third decade of the 21st century at the level of public opinion is of great guiding significance for people to rationally grasp the current domestic and international situation and to insist on deepening reform and opening up in an all-round way. Talking more about the “period of strategic opportunity” will not only help alleviate the anxiety of the public but also may play a role in raising future expectations and reminding party committees and governments at all levels, all sectors of society, and market players to seek truth from facts to objectively explore the development opportunities that exist."

"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","Capturing “opportunities” is an important prerequisite for resolving challenges and risks. Talking about the “period of strategic opportunity” is not meant to mislead people to ignore challenges and risks but to let people find pragmatic solutions to difficulties and challenges. Whether from the international environment or from the domestic reality, the existence of strategic opportunities is real, and of course, we must grasp them correctly: On the one hand, it is necessary to objectively clarify the strategic opportunities brought about by the external environment that is still favorable to China as a whole; on the other hand, it is necessary to fully explore important strategic opportunities that will still exist for a long time in China’s domestic development opportunities."
"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","From the perspective of the external environment, China has at least four important strategic opportunities."
"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","First, in the foreseeable future, the United States itself will be in a state of great political division, great economic stagnation, great social decline, and great distrust of discourse for a long time, which will objectively form a relatively favorable strategic situation for the rise of China. The U.S. policy toward China will continue to harass China’s development, but it cannot condense into an effective force to comprehensively contain China’s rise. Instead, it can force China to form a situation of unity and progress."
"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","The two political parties in the United States are seriously divided. Although they both believe that the rise of China is a deep challenge to the United States, they have not reached a consensus on how to deal with it, how to use it, and what degree of strength is needed for containment. After Trump took office in 2017, the United States has used various means to suppress China, such as economic and trade wars, technological wars, provoking frictions with China’s neighbors, and human rights and ideological attacks, but all have failed. In 2021, the trade volume between China and the United States will reach a new high, and the surplus with the United States will expand. Most people believe that the U.S. trade war with China has failed. Since Biden took office as U.S. president, the U.S. government has also been unable to come up with an effective way to deal with and contain the rise of China. What is more worthy of attention is that the political division in the United States has led to the failure of the system and the division of society. The national values and political discourse on which the United States depends, such as democracy, freedom, and the rule of law, are under unprecedented internal doubt. Fukuyama, Ray Dalio, and other political and economic figures have predicted that the “veto politics” in the United States is rampant, and a civil war or national collapse may break out in the future.21 Since the second half of 2021, the U.S. inflation rate has repeatedly hit new highs in more than 40 years, exposing the illusion of the so-called “economic recovery.” In 2021, China’s economic aggregate will be about 78 percent of that of the United States, and China has become the country with the smallest gap with the United States in its status as the No. 1 economy in the past 130 years. Most institutions predict that in the next eight years or so, China will surpass the United States as the world’s largest economy. In the medium and long term, time is still on China’s side. 22"
"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","Second, the division among Western countries and the worsening of internal conflicts have objectively provided a strategic space for China to break through the Western blockade and resolve the “new Cold War” trend of the West against China. The internal contradictions between the United States and Europe are fierce, and France and Germany, which seek diplomatic independence, will not allow the European Union to fully follow the United States’ policy of containing China. Although Lithuania’s “pawn”-style anti-China forces have appeared in the 17 Central and Eastern European countries, they are not enough to become a trend. The United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, Canada, and others have followed suit with regard to U.S. policies. However, given the huge economic interests in China, domestic opposition to China’s policy of containing China is rising. The policies of these countries towards China are more or less “on the wall” that “appears to be in favor of the United States, but actually still engages with China.” China-UK, China-Japan, China-Australia, and China-Canada trade volume has continued to rise in recent years, and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), including Australia, was officially launched on New Year’s Day in 2022. These are typical examples."
"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","Third, the regional influence of Russia, Turkey, Iran, and other emerging economies has checked, balanced, and contained the U.S. hegemony for a long time. This has created more strategic time for China to build a moderate and dexterous foreign relationship. Coupled with the promotion of the Belt and Road construction over the past nine years, China has not only made friends around the world but also expanded unprecedented external space. The Russian-Ukrainian conflict that broke out in February 2022 has turned into a tug-of-war, which has completely deteriorated the relationship between Russia and the West. The game between the United States and Russia over the post-Ukrainian crisis will be protracted; the rise of Turkey and Iran’s influence in the Middle East has also restrained the energy of the United States. The Belt and Road construction has reshaped the external opportunities for China as a rising power. Instead of falling into an international dilemma like the United States with enemies everywhere, China has many true friends like Pakistan and Serbia who stand up with China at critical moments."

The agenda of developing countries will become the mainstream global discourse. Whether it be the United Nations’ 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Vision 2040 for Latin America, or the call for “joint efforts to build a prosperous and united Africa on the basis of common values and common destiny,” “development” has become the greatest common divisor of national strategies.23 Undoubtedly, there has been an unprecedented political awakening in developing countries. As for the concept of a community with a shared future for mankind advocated by China, especially during the pandemic period, China has shown great love in the export of masks, ventilators, vaccines, and other materials and international mutual assistance, such that China has grown in popularity around the world. According to the survey data of the Pew Research Center of the United States from various countries around the world, the favorability of China’s image has exceeded that of the United States on many occasions."

In the first three rounds of the industrial revolution, China lagged seriously behind. At present, China is basically in the same position as developed countries in many more advanced fields such as the digital economy, artificial intelligence, 5G research and development, supercomputing, nanomaterials, manned spaceflight, smart cities, and quantum science. China has ranked second in the world in scientific research funding for nine consecutive years and is expected to surpass the United States to become the first in 2022. The latest research report The Great Tech Rivalry: China vs. the U.S. in the 21st Century released by Harvard University and Cambridge University clearly pointed out: “China’s technology is rising rapidly. In some races, it has already become No. 1. In others, on current trajectories, it will overtake the United States within the next decade.”24"
"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","In conclusion, in terms of strategic opportunities in the external environment, despite the growing and changing external challenges, it has to be said that in the “three superimposed phases” of the adjustment period of the power structure of the great powers, the period of technological wave-led replacement, and the period of changes to the system of global development and with the rise of groups in developing countries, cooperation, peace, and recovery are the greatest common divisors of the demands of all countries. Notably, China is still in an important period when opportunities outweigh challenges for a long time.25 In this regard, we cannot be swayed by the “clamors” of Western public opinion against China and the unfriendly voices or events of some countries. The total stock of China’s overseas assets exceeds $8 trillion, and some external bumps are inevitable. Judging from the author’s long-term follow-up and foreign exchanges with nearly 100 countries in the past decade, it must be said with confidence that most of the actions and clamors of the United States against China are still “all thunder and no rain” or quixotic politician performance that cannot impede China’s long-term development."
"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","From the perspective of the internal environment, China also has at least four important strategic opportunities."
"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","First, the ever-increasing authority of the CCP Central Committee and the leadership of the CCP have provided China with unparalleled strategic capabilities for the introduction and implementation of China’s next major reform and opening-up policy. Since socialism with Chinese characteristics entered a new era, the process of building and modernizing China’s national governance system has accelerated, and various domestic systems have been continuously improved. Through the implementation of major policies such as targeted poverty alleviation, ecological environmental protection, anti-corruption and anti-criminalism, risk prevention and control, social governance, digital economy, rule of law, and common prosperity, the Chinese people’s support for the government and social solidarity are unmatched by any developed country. Regardless of what major reform measures it wants to push and what major things it wants to do, the Chinese government has this system advantage and leadership ability more than any other country at any time."
"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","Second, the possibility of a huge economic scale and large room for development has been continuously stimulated, making China’s sustainable development possess strategic potential unmatched by other countries. After China became the world’s largest foreign exchange reserve country in 2006, the world’s largest manufacturing country in 2010, the world’s largest trader in goods in 2013, and the world’s largest trading country in 2018, China’s amount of foreign direct investment and foreign investment attracted for the first time in 2020 surpassed the United States and became the world’s largest consumer market. In addition, China also has the most complete and largest industrial categories and industrial system in the world and has the world’s largest number of talents with higher education or various professional skills. Even so, China’s development potential is still quite large; there are a billion people who have never been on a plane, with only about 5 percent of the population with an undergraduate education, compared to the United States, where the number is about 25 percent. As long as we continue to reform and open up, the industrial monopoly and local protections in all aspects of production, distribution, circulation, and consumption at home and abroad will be broken, and the organic renewal, shantytown renovation, and moderately advanced infrastructure construction of cities in various places have been fully launched, and a new round of growth points have been found in the development space of consumption, investment, urbanization, digital economy, and green economy.26"
"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","Third, the Chinese people’s will to aspire to a better life has become more determined, giving China’s future high-quality development a strategic impetus originating from the grassroots of society. Compared with the early days of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, today’s Chinese are more concerned with the quality of life and the material standards of individuals; compared with the early days of reform and opening up, today’s Chinese are also unwilling to endure the pollution, corruption, and injustice that rapid economic growth has brought. This gives China’s economy an endogenous impetus to transform from speed and scale to quality and benefits, such that policies issued by the State continue to promote changes in quality, efficiency, and power. With a commitment to the establishment of the “green, low-carbon and circular development economic system” mentioned in the report of the 19th Party Congress, final development results will better benefit all people as we continue to realize the people’s yearning for a better life. Compared to 1978 when China was still one of the poorest countries in the world, China is now the second largest economy in the world. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the average annual social consumption of Chinese residents is about $4,600, which is only 1/4 of that of the United States. The per capita housing area in China’s cities and towns is about 40 square meters, about five times the 8.1 square meters in 1978, but still less than 2/3 of that in the United States (about 65 square meters). There are only 0.21 cars per capita in China, 1/5 of that of Americans. The urbanization rate in China is only 57 percent, a far cry from the 82 percent urbanization rate in the United States. In 2021, China’s forest coverage rate had increased from 10 percent to 23 percent, the largest increase in the world, but there is still a big gap with the world’s average forest coverage rate of 32 percent.27 Fourth, the Chinese people have continuously improved their self-confidence in the path ahead in recent years and accumulated experience in constantly fighting internal and external risks, which has cultivated a large number of strategic talents for the future to calmly cope with various risks and challenges. Over the past 10 years, under the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese have effectively dealt with a series of deep internal contradictions such as corruption within the Party, deterioration of the ecological environment, social differentiation, targeted poverty alleviation, systemic financial risk prevention, and prevention and control of COVID-19. The Chinese have successfully resolved economic and trade wars, technological wars, border frictions, human rights, and ideological repression, as well as a series of external pressures from hegemonic forces in the United States and the West, such as those related to Hong Kong, Xinjiang, Tibet, and the seas, as batch after batch of young and middle-aged cadres have been baptized with experience to improve their skills.

"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","Analyzing the many domestic and foreign bases that still exist in the “current and future period” during the period of important strategic opportunities, it is not to shy away from in-depth research on the increasingly complex and increasingly unstable domestic and foreign environments and does not even ignore the complex external environment in which the current world economy is sluggish, globalization goes against the flow, the global pattern is turbulent, and peace is threatened. On the contrary, summarizing the practical enlightenment of the previous important period of strategic opportunities and firmly believing that the important period of strategic opportunities is still extending, we must promote the whole Party and the whole country to further unify thought, will, and action and must also further unite and lead the people of all ethnic groups in the country to win new great victories of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era in the future. Furthermore, we must always grasp the historical initiative of the development of the Party and the country in the new era and new journey and strengthen the courage and will to anchor the established goals and move forward with high spirits as this will be of great practical and far-reaching historical significance."
"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","Throughout modern history, China has missed important strategic opportunities at least twice. In the 15th century, the era of great voyages began. The emperor of the Ming Dynasty dispatched Zheng He to the Western Ocean seven times, but he did not turn overseas development into a driving force for domestic wealth growth, ideological enlightenment, and technological revolution. In the end, the great strategic opportunity that could have been the first in China to realize the upgrading of human civilization since modern times was missed. In the second half of the 19th century, the Westernization faction in the late Qing Dynasty put forward the idea of “learning the skills of foreigners” and launched the Westernization Movement, but it failed in the battle with the conservative faction. After that, the Qing court did not think about reforms, became blindly xenophobic, and successively lost in the China-Japanese War and the Eight-Power Allied Forces’ invasion of China. They missed the opportunity again, and eventually became the target of backwardness and beatings, as the spheres of influence were carved up by foreign powers."
"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","Judging from the course of the rise of the United States in the 20th century, the United States was able to become the victor by subtly joining the Allied Powers in the latter stages of World War I and abandoning its policy of isolationism after the attack on Pearl Harbor to become an anti-fascist leader in World War II. It has been able to take the lead in recovering from the previous international financial crises and also won the Cold War by delicately launching an arms race with the Soviet Union. The important experience of the United States, which has risen from a small country ranking in the global middle to a global hegemony that has remained the world’s largest economy for more than 130 years, is that it is good at seizing strategic opportunities and diluting risks while seizing opportunities."
"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","The two positive and negative experiences of modern China’s “encountering risks while losing opportunities” and modern America’s “diluting risks while seizing opportunities” remind us that at the moment when the realization of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is at its closest, it is important to both guard against risks and seize opportunities. If you only see opportunities and fail to pay attention to risks, you may be blindly optimistic and go backward for several years. If you only guard against risks and fail to seize opportunities, you may stop moving forward and miss opportunities."
"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","The dialectical unity of risks and opportunities is an important experience of the Communist Party of China, which is still flourishing as a century-old party. Looking back on the 100-year history of the growth and success of the Communist Party of China, from the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression to the victory of the War of Liberation, from the founding of New China to the success of reform and opening up, to a large extent, the Party has been constantly preventing and defusing risks and identifying and capturing strategic opportunities. Therefore, taking history as a mirror, at least three points are worth considering in China today."
"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","First, we must correctly guide public opinion and actively shape recovery opportunities. In the spring of 2022, China experienced repeated outbreaks of COVID-19, and the downward pressure on the economy has further increased. Many industries and sectors that have been hit by the pandemic and have encountered difficulties or even short-term shocks are facing opportunities for re-distribution and re-expansion. From a macro perspective, we must talk more about the “period of strategic opportunities” as it will encourage individuals, enterprises, and institutions to adopt moderately advanced expansion policies, such as moderately advanced infrastructure construction, moderately loose monetary and credit policies, moderately avant-garde consumption behavior, and moderately risky investment behavior. This will allow us to maintain medium-to-high-speed growth in all fields of society and bring together the forces that promote the country’s realization of the 14th Five-Year Plan and the 2035 Vision Outline. In fact, the Two Sessions of 2022 set China’s economic growth target at 5.5 percent for 2022, which is a pragmatic move that takes into account both risks and opportunities. Regarding the risks discussed by experts, scholars, and the Big V in the media and public opinion, we need to clarify a problem, that is, as long as China maintains a medium-to-high speed development, some risks such as debt, credit, and investment can be worried about and foreseen."
"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","In the face of profound changes in the internal and external environments of China’s development since the new era, we must firmly believe that it is an objective fact that the period of strategic opportunities still exists, and we must actively seize the period of opportunities and give correct guidance in public opinion. Specifically, party committees and governments at all levels must emphasize risk prevention and safety. At the same time, we should rationally and objectively also talk about the “period of strategic opportunities.” This is not blind optimism about the situation but targeted encouragement for the future. It will not only help loosen the details of policies, rekindle passion for development, release economic vitality, and raise social expectations but will also promote the transformation and upgrading of China’s current national undertakings. As pointed out in the 14th Five-Year Plan and 2035 Vision Outline: “Accurately recognize changes, respond scientifically, actively seek changes, be good at nurturing opportunities in crises, open new situations in changing situations, seize opportunities, respond to challenges, seek advantages and avoid disadvantages, and move forward bravely.”30"
"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","Second, we must be brave, excel in external struggles, and maintain our strategic focus on opening up. In recent years, the game between major powers has been fierce, and China has frequently struggled with some Western forces, especially the United States. The United States also regards China as “the only country that has both the will and the ability to reshape the international order economically, diplomatically, militarily, and technologically.”31 Talking more about the “period of strategic opportunities” is not only an important manifestation of rationally viewing external risks and challenges but also an important basis for adhering to strategic determination, as well as an important driving force for guiding the people to open their eyes, relax their minds, and do their own affairs well. It is an important way of thinking to seek breakthroughs from these difficulties and challenges. External struggles are not an end but a means. Whether it is in the fields of politics, diplomacy, ideology, finance, economy, trade, or discourse power, the goal of daring to fight and being good at fighting is to meet current challenges, resolve internal and external conflicts, promote internal and external cooperation, and achieve national rejuvenation.32 For the United States, the biggest external variable affecting China’s rise, we must maintain a “head-to-head” mentality. Although it is difficult for the United States to become China’s friend at present, we do not have to push it to the position of an enemy. Of course, while daring to fight externally, we must also improve the ability and flexibility to be good at fighting."
"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","In the face of the high anxiety of existing external hegemons about China’s rise and the trend of comprehensive containment, we need to have the strategic confidence and determination to coordinate domestic and foreign countries and handle them calmly to resolve this through an all-around opening-up policy. This requires accelerating system improvement in areas such as foreign personnel exchanges, financial opening, China-foreign cooperation, attracting talents, promoting the implementation of reforms, and adopting more relatively active and relatively loose policies. Therefore, the Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th CCP Central Committee put forward the major strategic deployment of “accelerating the formation of a new development pattern with the domestic cycle as the main body and the domestic and international dual cycles promoting one another.” The more open and strong China is, the more it must maintain a posture of embracing, integrating, and leading the world as well as maintaining stability in domestic development. It can be said that no external force can stop the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation."
"On the Strategic Opportunity Period in the New Era: Origin, Status Quo, and Future","Journal of the Central Institute of Socialism , Wang Wen","Aug 15, 2022","Third, we must tap into the dividends of reform and innovation and explore the expansion of resources and markets around the world. At present, China is more capable than ever before of obtaining global funds, resources, talents, and information to serve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and, more than ever, has the ability to contribute wisdom and solutions to human problems. Seizing the “period of strategic opportunity” requires that we continuously tap “reform dividends” and “innovation dividends” domestically. It also requires that we allocate more resources and a larger market on a global scale to seek stronger growth vitality in terms of internationalization, digitization, greening, and quality. The foundation of China’s next round of economic growth must be based on the domestic market of 1.4 billion people, and it must also focus on the world market of 7.5 billion people. It should seize the importance of the strategic window of low-cost global resources in the post-pandemic era and the urgent need for mergers and acquisitions. In this regard, the global deployment experience of companies and institutions in Europe, the United States, and Japan is worth learning from."

Political and Social Roots of the Russian Economy and Prospects for National Development,"Eurasian Economy , Feng Yujun","Feb 14, 2022","Putin has been in power in Russia for more than 20 years since 2000. During this period, apart from recovering its growth at a higher rate with the help of high oil prices before 2008, since 2009, the Russian economy has been hovering at a low rate of growth and even fell into recession several times. The economic miracle that Putin has repeatedly promised has failed to materialize, and Russia’s position in the world economic system continues to decline uncontrollably. Thus, an important question naturally arises for the researcher: What causes such a result? There are, of course, different dimensions when studying this issue, and the results may also be a matter of opinion. I will attempt to explore the influence of political system and social ecology on Russia’s economic development from the perspective of the reaction of the superstructure to the economic base."
Political and Social Roots of the Russian Economy and Prospects for National Development,"Eurasian Economy , Feng Yujun","Feb 14, 2022",1. Trajectory of Russian Economic Development
Political and Social Roots of the Russian Economy and Prospects for National Development,"Eurasian Economy , Feng Yujun","Feb 14, 2022","According to the policy adjustment at the subjective level and the economic performance at the objective level, we can divide the Russian economic development over the past 20 years into four stages."
Political and Social Roots of the Russian Economy and Prospects for National Development,"Eurasian Economy , Feng Yujun","Feb 14, 2022","The first phase, from 2000 to 2004, can be called the “reformist” period. During Putin’s first presidential term, the “Gref Program” was formulated and implemented, which the government adopted in 2000 as The Socioeconomic Development Strategy for the Russian Federation until 2010. During this period, the government advanced taxation, progressive pension and civil service reforms, passed the Land Law, vigorously removed administrative barriers to starting a business, and accelerated negotiations for Russia’s accession to the WTO. With these reforms, Russia’s economic growth accelerated, foreign investment inflows increased, and the ruble began to strengthen."
Political and Social Roots of the Russian Economy and Prospects for National Development,"Eurasian Economy , Feng Yujun","Feb 14, 2022","The second phase was from 2004 to the first half of 2008, running through Putin’s second term as president. This stage can be called the “state capitalism” stage, and its most prominent feature was large-scale re-nationalization. Marked by the “Yukos Incident,” the Russian government tried to lead the economic revival by building a large state-owned enterprise behemoth. During this period, most reforms ceased, and major reforms continued only in the macroeconomic and financial spheres. The first phase of reforms, however, undoubtedly brought tangible results: The national debt was almost fully paid off, and a stabilization fund and a key element of a competitive banking system, the deposit insurance system, were established. Falling inflation and the introduction of deposit insurance have created new opportunities for the development of the financial sector and increased corporate and consumer lending. Macroeconomic stability and investment rating upgrades have contributed to a sharp increase in foreign investment. During Putin’s first two presidencies, the economy grew at an average annual rate of about 7 percent. In the decade from 1999 to 2008, Russia’s economy nearly doubled (GDP growth in dollar terms was higher, from $210 billion in 1999 to $1.8 trillion in 2008, a 7.5-fold increase, due to rising oil prices and foreign investment inflows that led to a substantial strengthening of the ruble). This was the most glorious decade in Russia’s modern economic history, with economic growth comparable to the economic recovery during the New Economic Policy (NEP) period and higher than the average annual growth rate of 5% during the Soviet Union’s industrialization under Stalin. Of course, in addition to the follow-up effects of the first-stage reforms, the sharp rise in international oil prices has become an important external factor for the relatively high-speed growth of the Russian economy in this decade. From 1998 to 2008, the average international oil price rose from US$13 per barrel to US$97, an increase of almost 6.5 times. Therefore, some Russian economists believe that high oil prices contributed to 30-50% of the economic growth under Putin’s first two presidential terms."

In fact, the high-speed growth of the Russian economy all but ended in 2008. Although the government formulated The Concept for Long-term Social and Economic Development of the Russian Federation 2020 in 2008 and put forward the development ideas of integrating into the global economic system, increasing investment in human resources, and realizing innovative development, however, with the advent of the global financial crisis, the plans proposed by the development concept have come to naught, and no substantial reforms have actually taken place. In the decade after the crisis (2010-2019), the Russian economy grew at an average annual rate of less than 2%. In January 2011, Putin instructed the HSE University and the Plekhanov Russian University of Economics to organize a large number of experts to formulate a new Strategy 2020. To this end, 21 working groups were set up to reformulate a comprehensive reform plan. The main goal of Strategy 2020 was to try to remove barriers to investment in business and human resources and create a “new model of economic growth.” At the same time, in order to participate in the 2012 presidential election, another plan for the development of Russia was released in 2012 and became Putin’s election platform. Its economic section was published in January 30, 2012 issue of Sputnik under the title We Need a New Economy. On May 7, 2012, after being re-elected as president, Putin signed the 12-item May Decree, one of which was a decree on the country’s long-term economic policy. He proposed to promote a fundamental improvement in the investment climate, reduce excessive state intervention in economic life, and predicted that this would increase labor productivity by half within seven years and increase investment to 27% of GDP. In reality, however, the promised reforms have not been implemented and the expected economic outcomes have not been realized. After a brief recovery after the 2010-2011 crisis, economic growth began to decline rapidly again."

The subsequent drop in oil prices, the Crimean crisis, Western sanctions, and the COVID-19 pandemic have hit the Russian economy hard, with an average annual growth rate of only 0.35% from 2014 to 2020. Russia’s GDP in dollar terms remained at 2008 levels, and its share of the world economy fell from 3% in 2008 to 2% in 2018. Investment did not grow to 27% of GDP, but stayed at 20-22%.

External factors such as falling oil prices and Western sanctions have indeed limited Russia’s economic development to a certain extent, the most fundamental reason, however, is that the political system, political culture, method of governance, social ecology, and other superstructure factors have made the endogenous power of economic development insufficient."

The increasing vertical power system constantly changes the political atmosphere and social ecology in Russia and has had a significant negative impact on economic development."
Political and Social Roots of the Russian Economy and Prospects for National Development,"Eurasian Economy , Feng Yujun","Feb 14, 2022","Under the new political and economic system, the state’s intervention in all processes of the political, social, and economic system has increased substantially. Since 2003, government intervention has continued to increase in almost all major macro- and micro-economic links such as investment, pricing, profit distribution, rates of return, imports and exports, procurement and sales, and regulations and policies on taxation, tariffs, and finances. Similarly, adjustments have increasingly restricted business operations. Although the government has not yet controlled all economic resources and has not implemented comprehensive control over the economy, the market allocation of resources and the space for business entities to operate independently have been greatly compressed, making it difficult for business entities to operate fully and freely such that economic efficiency is becoming increasingly low. If the nature and speed of the expansion of administrative regulation remain unchanged, the market space may be further compressed in the next few years which may eventually lead to a full-blown conflict between the market and regulation. Russian economist Sergei Guriyev believes that “the political system of excessive state interference in all areas of social life limits economic growth” and that this “super-centralized management system is not suitable for managing a country as large as Russia.” Another Russian scholar Nikita Maslennikov also stressed that “the fundamental reason why economic problems have not been resolved for many years is excessive power. It is simply impossible to achieve rapid economic development within the existing institutional framework. Furthermore, a future transition of power could have a disproportionate impact on the political and even the economic system.”"

This is especially true in terms of the behavior of power elites which, to a large extent, affects the investment environment, social ecology, human resources, and even changes in popular sentiment. Since 2003, the re-nationalization of Russia has been accompanied by a new round of distribution of interests and power struggles (such as the Ulyukayev incident). During the process of re-nationalization, many senior government officials served as the chairmen of the boards of directors or the boards of supervisors of large state-owned enterprises, while their relatives, friends, and former students seized favorable positions in these state-owned enterprises and enjoyed the dividends of state-owned assets."
Political and Social Roots of the Russian Economy and Prospects for National Development,"Eurasian Economy , Feng Yujun","Feb 14, 2022","Compared with S&T progress, innovative development, and optimization of human resources, these people were more concerned with how to divide up natural monopolies and financial resources, leading to the overall low efficiency of state-owned enterprises. State-owned enterprises have occupied market resources and are protected by the government, resulting in a long-term business environment that is not conducive to the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises. More importantly, re-nationalization has led to a loss of confidence among domestic and foreign investors in the willingness and ability of the Russian government to protect reliable private property rights, leading to a long-term large-scale outflow of capital that remains difficult to effectively contain."
Political and Social Roots of the Russian Economy and Prospects for National Development,"Eurasian Economy , Feng Yujun","Feb 14, 2022","After mastering the power to manipulate economic resources, Russian political elites have lacked clear strategic planning and practical actions on how to achieve long-term economic development and deal with the increasingly fierce economic competition between major powers. Despite the increasing concentration of political power in Russia in 2003, electoral politics was still ostensibly practiced. On the one hand, to maintain power stability and even govern over the long term while also gaining the support of voters, under the pressure of the inherent tension of such a goal, buying the votes of the people by providing basic living stability and social welfare has become the basic logic of Russia’s political and economic life. In this context, maintaining macroeconomic stability and controlling inflation have become the core issues of the government’s economic policy. The stability fund and national welfare fund established with petrodollars earned when oil prices are high have become important “airbags” but have not been effectively invested in the strategic development of the economy. Much of the money the Russian banking system has drawn from the oil and gas industry over the past 20 years has ended up in international speculative business rather than domestic real-economy investment. In this regard, Glazyev, the former economic adviser to the Russian president, believes that the main reason for recession in the countries is because, for many years, senior economic officials such as Kudrin, Gref, and Nabiullina have adhered to the Chicago School of monetary policy, restricting the monetary supply to reduce the rate of inflation. Vladimir Kimperson believes that the key to Russia’s economic recession is the gap and contradiction between the current government’s conservative policies and the long-term modernization trends of technology, education, and culture. According to a September 2021 study by the Carnegie Center in Moscow, the authors of the study confirmed in multiple conversations with people who understand the logic of high-level thinking in power that the principle of survival for those in power is “as long as there is enough oil and gas to generate revenue for the federal budget in our years in power, it is enough for us to use budget spending to buy voter loyalty and suppress civil society and media opinion. After that (2036), what happens happens.” It can be said that under the current institutional environment, quite a few Russian power elites are short-sighted and indifferent to the long-term strategic risks facing the country, not only fundamentally rejecting modernization efforts but also losing pragmatic strategic thinking. Many of them are satisfied with the existing management model, are accustomed to living in a comfortable “small world,” ignore the rapid changes in the external environment and unprecedented new challenges, and are increasingly reluctant to listen to the opinions of experts. Not only that, but policymakers are quite conceited that the economic policies they make are ideal. Instead of thinking about economic development in a holistic and systematic way, they self-righteously divide the economy into different parts such as exports, state-owned economy, and social consumption and have even deceived themselves into believe that “everything is fine.” Under the situation of the bureaucratic system, society and the people have lost their political and economic autonomy. They are like diners at a restaurant who can only eat what the chef enjoys because the chef knows better than the diners what he likes to eat best."
Political and Social Roots of the Russian Economy and Prospects for National Development,"Eurasian Economy , Feng Yujun","Feb 14, 2022","Guided by this way of thinking, the power class is more concerned with “dividing the pie” rather than “making it bigger.” As the economist Andrei Movchan said, Russia as a social system does not create value, but extracts value by exporting raw materials and distributes that value domestically. Compared with the diversified economic development premised on competition, this distribution of benefits is easily in the hands of the ruling class, who benefit more in the process. This also leads to a situation wherein “preserving control over the value distribution process presupposes the suppression of independent value-forming centers, resulting in suppression of both entrepreneurial processes and also diversified economic growth.”"

However, more than 20 years of Russian political and economic practice have shown that because the centralization of managers conflicts with the objective trends of social development, the result of the increasingly intensified vertical power system is low administrative efficiency. There is a negative correlation between power concentration and management ability. The concentration of power and resources often causes the internal power of the market to stall, officials in power are unwilling or do not know how to take responsibility, and more and more minority interests are ignored."
Political and Social Roots of the Russian Economy and Prospects for National Development,"Eurasian Economy , Feng Yujun","Feb 14, 2022","In the process of modern economic decision-making, structural policies should be the result of communication and continuous dialog between economic decision-makers and multiple participants in the economic system. However, the growing expansion of Russia’s vertical power system for more than 20 years has disrupted the channels of information exchange between the state and society. Obligations to superiors lead to the lack of a normal and timely information feedback loop in the decision-making process, and authorities at all levels are reluctant to understand the real situation and listen to expert opinions. When officials do their best to avoid angering their superiors, the phenomenon of “reporting good news but not bad news” becomes increasingly common. This completely distorts the normal decision-making process of making real and sober analysis, forecasts, and plans based on comprehensive, objective, and accurate data and assessments. Lack of feedback and communication, including with professionals, hinders sound economic policy development. In the officialdom culture where everyone is at risk, “inaction” has become the consensus of officials at all levels, and even the high-level political elites at the core of power are afraid to lose their official positions and thus stay silent, never daring to discuss issues openly. This phenomenon is very similar to what happened at the end of Brezhnev’s reign. In addition, the authorities widely use modern information technologies such as big data, video surveillance, and facial recognition to collect data and information on ordinary citizens, suppress social dissent, and prevent public protests. Instead of being a tool to help governments and society communicate with each other, new technologies are doing the opposite. Since the existing public administration mechanism operates on the will of the top power elites rather than on social feedback, it does not introduce modern technological solutions for the benefit of the masses, nor does it provide timely corrections to those distorted information used in decision-making."
Political and Social Roots of the Russian Economy and Prospects for National Development,"Eurasian Economy , Feng Yujun","Feb 14, 2022","Russian academics drawn different interpretations of the reasons for the erosion of the feedback loop in the decision-making process. Sergei Guriev emphasized that “deliberately destroying the feedback system is an active strategy of the authorities, because from the point of view of developing alternatives, the risks involved in the feedback system outweigh the benefits of receiving the feedback for the Russian authorities.” In his view, “Russian authorities are fully aware of all the risks that exist, but their interests are different from those of ordinary citizens, whose interests are contrary to the interests of the country’s development. Their goal is to retain power and be completely content with the status quo. In this sense, it should come as no surprise that their actions are aimed at strengthening repressive institutions, increasing scrutiny, investing in propaganda rather than human resources, and using foreign policy for internal purposes.” Mikhail Krutikhin’s view was relatively moderate, arguing that “it is impossible for the authorities to be unaware of the challenges. Th power elites are more like temporary workers, without a real long-term plan or strategic vision. What they are concerned with is how to allocate and monetize administrative resources.” Another risk, noted by Mikhail Dmitriev, is that “populism among the population may increase under the influence of a crisis, while development needs weaken. This will become an obstacle to the democratization of the political system and will limit the possibility of implementing economic policies aimed at development.”"
Political and Social Roots of the Russian Economy and Prospects for National Development,"Eurasian Economy , Feng Yujun","Feb 14, 2022","Under the existing profit distribution pattern, the energy and military industries are not only important pillars of support for national fiscal revenue but are also core areas for attracting investment. Yet it is precisely the priority of these two industries that perpetuates the deformed structure of the Russian economy, leaving Russia behind in the pace of the new energy revolution and the fourth industrial revolution. As Mikhail Dmitriev put it, “adaptation to the conditions of the global energy transition is hampered by powerful interest groups representing the traditional energy and raw materials sectors, as well as by the increased operating risks of large and medium-sized companies. This will inhibit innovation and the development of new markets in non-resource sectors that need to grow faster to compensate for losses in traditional sectors of the Russian economy.”"
Political and Social Roots of the Russian Economy and Prospects for National Development,"Eurasian Economy , Feng Yujun","Feb 14, 2022","More importantly, with the advancement of the global decarbonization process, the Russian energy industry will face increasingly severe medium and long-term challenges, which will put enormous pressure on national finances. Russian economic experts predict that even a modest global energy transition and decarbonization scenario will bring growing losses to the Russian economy over the next decade. With the implementation of the EU carbon tax, Russian exporters are losing at least $300 million to $5 billion a year. As the most important fossil energy consumption market shrinks, the Russian energy industry will lose its previous active position. By 2040, the reduction in demand for fossil fuels could cause serious problems for Russian state revenues, and tax incentives to stimulate oil and gas production and exports will not help. What follows will be a deterioration of the state’s fiscal position, and the problem of heavy domestic and foreign debt burdens of the 1990s will inevitably re-emerge."
Political and Social Roots of the Russian Economy and Prospects for National Development,"Eurasian Economy , Feng Yujun","Feb 14, 2022","Many experts believe that Russia’s technological backwardness is closely linked to a political system that is immune to innovation and prone to self-isolation. Mikhail Krutikhin believes that “the technological backwardness of protection under the conditions of parasitic natural resources will lead to Russia’s separation from the world economic system by the middle of the 21st century, and the population and economic situation will seriously deteriorate.” Oleg Yolkin emphasized that technological backwardness will also lead to difficulties in maintaining the balance of forces and the development of new weapons, estimating that after 15-20 years, Russia’s possibility of maintaining military-technical autonomy will be limited. “There is a threat of disruption of the military-technical balance between Russia and the United States and even China,” he said, because “the global trend in modern conditions is that the development of weapons is achieved by the transfer of technology from the civilian industry to the defense industry, not from the military to civilian industry as it was decades ago.”"

In addition, it distorts the understanding of domestic and foreign affairs, triggering false or irrational responses to world trends. An important manifestation is the radicalization of Russia’s foreign policy after 2007, which was caused by various factors. In particular, the two wars against Georgia and Ukraine have caused a large-scale deterioration of Russia’s external environment. After the 1998 financial crisis and the 2008 international financial crisis, Russia also ushered in a “sanctions crisis.” In the foreseeable future, in order to boost the presidential election in 2024 and 2030, Russia may make major moves on the issues of the Russia-Belarus Union and Ukraine, so it is difficult to significantly alleviate this sanctions crisis. The closed investment, idea, and technology climate combined with tensions with the United States and the European Union have place Russia in a state of “self-isolation.” Furthermore, self-isolation exacerbates the already existing economic lag – without engaging in international cooperation, without access to advanced ideas and technologies, and without access to the experience and capital of developed countries, Russia is doomed to remain behind. Thus, a vicious cycle ensues — as the economy deteriorates, sanctions restrictions grow, and the threat of inflation returns."
Political and Social Roots of the Russian Economy and Prospects for National Development,"Eurasian Economy , Feng Yujun","Feb 14, 2022","In the social sector, weak economic growth since the 2010s, stagnant real disposable income, and low-skilled jobs have worsened the quality of human resources. In turn, low-quality human resources limit opportunities for economic development and increased labor productivity. In the next 10 to 15 years, the human resource crisis will become a major constraint on the development of Russia. Today, the phenomenon of Russians preferring secondary vocational education to higher education has emerged on a large scale due to low household income and the desire to earn money as soon as possible, which has alarmed and worried many experts. Evgeny Gontmakher called the challenge “a challenge that touches every aspect of Russian life and will lead to the degradation of all institutions, including the state.” Sergei Guriev said with concern, “The important competitive advantages that Russia once had — the education system, the respect for human resources — are constantly being undermined. Educated people are being lost, and universities and schools are falling behind their competitors. In 10 to 15 years, Russia will not have a clear source of economic growth, nor will it close the gap with the developed world.”"
Political and Social Roots of the Russian Economy and Prospects for National Development,"Eurasian Economy , Feng Yujun","Feb 14, 2022","An important manifestation of the deterioration of human resources is the accelerated outflow of knowledge and wealth elites. According to a study published in August 2021 by a Russian research agency, more than 10 million Russians currently live outside their home country. Between 2000 and 2020 alone, between 4 million and 5.5 million Russian citizens emigrated abroad. The period from 2016 to 2019 was the highest period of overseas immigration, during which more than 300,000 people moved overseas each year, for a total of 1,186,138 people. The period from 2006 to 2011 saw the lowest numbers over the past 20 years, when only 698,070 Russian citizens left the country. The results of the researchers’ survey of 20- to 70-year-old Russians who immigrated to 65 different countries showed that 55 percent of the migrants were between the ages of 30 and 40, and they were 20 to 40 years old when they left Russia. The level of education of 92% of immigrants is at least tertiary, and 14% have advanced degrees. The main reasons for emigration range from concerns about improving economic conditions and giving future generations a better education, to dissatisfaction with corruption, lack of freedom, and the fear, danger, and despair of living in Russia. The survey showed that 79% of the respondents enjoyed life in their new countries, and they spoke highly of the security of the place of residence, social tolerance, and the stability of the new country. A large-scale and high-quality brain drain will undoubtedly be a huge loss to Russia’s economic and social development."

In fact, those who choose to stay are basically those who are under budgetary planning (“eat imperial food”), most of them are people who prefer a low salary but a stable job and do not want to take the risk of starting their own business. This accounts for the millions of various high-level government officials, security employees, military, and police. In the current social environment, most Russians tend to choose stable jobs, mainly in the public sector. The increase in the number of social classes that depend on the state budget for their livelihoods contradicts the expansion of state power, while the increase in personnel under budgetary planning reduces the activity and labor productivity of small and medium-sized enterprises."

Although many young people dream of working in the private sector or freelancing, due to the unparalleled dominance of the state sector, it is easier for them to be employed as police officers or property managers, and secondary vocational education is sufficient. This indirectly confirms the underdevelopment of the knowledge economy in Russia, because the existing economic structure and labor market do not require sophisticated knowledge and modern capabilities. In addition to the decline in population quality, the regional imbalance of human resources is also increasingly prominent. In such a vast territory of Russia, the population is mainly concentrated in the Greater Moscow region, the Greater St. Petersburg region, and the Rostov-Krasnodar-Sochi region.

Political and Social Roots of the Russian Economy and Prospects for National Development,"Eurasian Economy , Feng Yujun","Feb 14, 2022","First, the world economic system is facing a new round of differentiation and reshuffling. On the one hand, with the accelerated development of the new global industrial revolution, whether a country can hop on the express train of this technological revolution and industrial revolution in general will largely determine whether it will be at the center or the edge in the global division of labor of the future. On the other hand, the international economic order is being reshaped. At a time when the WTO is facing many doubts, a variety of new regional trade and investment mechanisms, such as CPTPP, the new US-Canada-Mexico Free Trade Agreement, the Japan-EU Free Trade Agreement, and the US-Japan Free Trade Agreement, are being built at an accelerated pace, and it has not even ruled out that they will be integrated in the future to form a new cross-regional trade and investment arrangement of a series of emerging economies participating in a highly free zone centered around developed countries. Although Russia has led the establishment of the Eurasian Economic Union, its scale and quality cannot be compared with the above-mentioned mechanisms, and the connection between Russia and its dominant Eurasian Economic Union and the global economic system may be further loosened; in addition, the global product chain is also readjusting. However, due to factors such as economic structure, Western sanctions, and self-isolation, Russia cannot occupy a favorable position in the process of resetting the global production chain. To be sure, the above-mentioned changes will have a crucial impact on Russia’s position and role in the world economic system."

At the same time, Russia and the United States have restarted strategic stability negotiations and have attempted to jointly shape new international arms control rules. On the other hand, security risks have also arisen. For example, Russia faces multiple challenges from Turkey in the Caspian-Mediterranean region. Militarily, while Russia continues to use every opportunity to demonstrate its achievements in equipment modernization, the global military balance is changing at an accelerated rate. U.S. military spending is 10 times that of Russia. In the medium and long term, Russia will be unable to maintain the same strategic balance with the U.S. as during the Cold War. The reason why Russia keeps “showing its muscles” is precisely because it sees the severe challenges it faces in the future, and it is precisely to attract the attention of the United States, forcing the United States to sit down and negotiate with Russia, using the international arms control rules jointly negotiated by Russia and the United States to constrain the great-power military competition of the future."

At the same time, Russia’s S&T potential is generally shrinking, its subsequent development momentum is limited, and its ability to participate in global economic, financial, and climate governance is noticeably insufficient. Russian economist Nikita Maslennikov predicts that, from a medium-term forecast, Russia’s macroeconomic growth rate will lag behind the world average by 50%-100%, which can already be called a “stagnation with signs of a structural crisis.” Coupled with the accelerating transformation of the global economy in areas such as the ESG agenda (ecological, social and governance standards for businesses), energy transition, global corporate minimum tax, new trade and investment agreements, “Russia is still on the world economic train, but rather than still sitting in coach, the country now only stands where the cars are connected.”"

A recent report from the Carnegie Center in Moscow argues that low living standards, persistence of poverty, stagnant or declining real disposable income, and social inequality in a broad sense have contributed to the loss of vitality of Russian society, high levels of social apathy, reluctance to strive to improve ones social status, and insensitivity to the deteriorating external environment is becoming the “new normal” of Russian society, and social indifference will trigger other systemic crises."

On the one hand, the trend of population decline has not been effectively controlled. On the other hand, the exodus of knowledge and wealth elites has accelerated. The ethnic and religious composition of the domestic population is also showing a trend that worries the Russian top brass."

In recent years, although Russia has achieved specific geopolitical goals through military operations such as the Russo-Georgian War, the Crimea crisis, and sending troops to Syria, it has received strong sanctions from the United States and Europe, and most countries in the post-Soviet space are also alienated from Russia. This trend is unlikely to change significantly in the next 15 years."

In the next 10 to 15 years, there are three issues that deserve attention: First, Russia will actively use hybrid warfare methods to achieve its own specific geopolitical goals with the help of the chaos in the process of international and regional system transformation. The impact it brings is worthy of high attention. Second, although it is difficult to comprehensively improve the US-Russia relationship, Russia will still actively seek to improve its relationship with the United States, and actively mobilize the triangular relationship between China, the United States, and Russia, utilizing the Sino-US conflict to relieve its own pressure. Third, before 2024, Russia may achieve a true Russia-Belarus alliance, while creating an image of a strong country, stimulating the market for the 2024 presidential election. Moreover, before the 2030 presidential election, other “frozen conflicts” in the post-Soviet space are likely to flare up again."
Political and Social Roots of the Russian Economy and Prospects for National Development,"Eurasian Economy , Feng Yujun","Feb 14, 2022","From the perspective of history, the tension between great power ambition and lack of strength is a key factor in determining Russia’s development trajectory. Looking back on the past, great ups and downs are an important feature of Russia’s historical development. Every failure and setback in foreign expansion will trigger a major turning point in Russia’s national development. In the next 15 years, stagnation in the broadest sense — from economic depression to social indifference — is Russia’s most probable development prospect. It is basically certain that in the next 10-15 years, Russia will face multiple challenges from climate change, energy transition, and the new industrial revolution, and Russia’s position in the global supply chain and value chain will further decline. At that time, the reactionary force of the lagging economic development on domestic politics and foreign policy will be revealed. By 2036 or even 2030, crises such as energy transition, economic stagnation, political rigidity, and aging leadership may break out in a concentrated manner, and Russia may usher in major historic changes."

You have a good understanding of the basic conditions of Mindong. I heard that you pay great attention to the word “rural.” Can you elaborate?"
"Reflections on the Economic Development of Mindong——Interview with Comrade Xi Jinping, Secretary of the CCP Ningde Prefectural Committee","Academic Review , Xi Jinping","Mar 2, 1989","XJP: The problem of economic construction in Mindong can be said to be largely the problem of farmers. Farmers account for the vast majority of the population, which is a basic situation. Agriculture is a feature and an advantage of Mindong. Of course, the agriculture we are talking about is not a small-scale peasant economy, but a large-scale agriculture in the sense of a commodity economy. In recent years, the economic strength of Mindong has been greatly improved, and the important performance is that agricultural production has continued to develop steadily, as domestic agriculture has developed from a single structure to a diversified one."
"Reflections on the Economic Development of Mindong——Interview with Comrade Xi Jinping, Secretary of the CCP Ningde Prefectural Committee","Academic Review , Xi Jinping","Mar 2, 1989","Q: I noticed your reference to “big agriculture,” which refers to your industrial thinking. Could you please talk about it specifically?"
"Reflections on the Economic Development of Mindong——Interview with Comrade Xi Jinping, Secretary of the CCP Ningde Prefectural Committee","Academic Review , Xi Jinping","Mar 2, 1989","XJP: The idea of large-scale agriculture is inseparable from the use of industries to promote agriculture. First of all, without a certain industrial base, there will be no certain financial strength, and further investment in agriculture will face problems. Secondly, the rational adjustment of the internal structure of agriculture and the formation of the agricultural and ancillary product consumption market all require industry as a catalyst. Of course, Mindong’s industry should also have its own way, that is, to properly handle the relationship between resource development and industry structure, with a focus on the processing and utilization of local resources. We must appropriately develop some industries that are required by the market, have considerable local production advantages, and utilize a large number of foreign raw materials. The future of Mindong’s industry lies in the establishment of a solid foundation for the supply of raw materials, rather than “cooking without rice.”"
"Reflections on the Economic Development of Mindong——Interview with Comrade Xi Jinping, Secretary of the CCP Ningde Prefectural Committee","Academic Review , Xi Jinping","Mar 2, 1989","Q: When it comes to the issue that industries in impoverished areas cannot “cook without rice,” I am reminded of the three hot topics of Mindong: the development of the Sandu’ao port, the construction of the Fuwen railway, and the construction of a central city. Would you mind sharing your thoughts on this?"
"Reflections on the Economic Development of Mindong——Interview with Comrade Xi Jinping, Secretary of the CCP Ningde Prefectural Committee","Academic Review , Xi Jinping","Mar 2, 1989","XJP: I think it is a good thing to have these three topics. It shows that the people of Mindong have improved their ability to understand nature. Of course, the transformation of nature also requires the maturity of objective conditions. The development and construction of ports, railways, and the like depend on the country’s macro decisions. The formation of central cities is also the result of long-term economic development. The financial revenue and expenditures in Mindong are unbalanced, and it will be difficult for us to carry out large-scale construction for a good while. It is necessary to let the outside world realize the meaning of these three things, but our foothold cannot rest upon this. Possibility and necessity are not the same as inevitability. Decisions concerning the overall situation of the regional development strategy must fully take into account national conditions, provincial conditions, and regional conditions. Development goals that are difficult to implement in the near future should not be advanced. The important thing is to do a good job in medium and short-term work."

"Reflections on the Economic Development of Mindong——Interview with Comrade Xi Jinping, Secretary of the CCP Ningde Prefectural Committee","Academic Review , Xi Jinping","Mar 2, 1989","XJP: Governing the economic environment actually provided Mindong with an opportunity. The spirit of the central government (rather than the emergency brake, as some people unilaterally understand it) is conducive to the development of productive forces in areas with relatively backward economies. Compared with speed and scale, Mindong would not be able to withstand it. The spirit of the central government enables Mindong to make use of its strengths and avoid weaknesses and to take advantage of the good opportunities for governance and rectification to promote the steady and coordinated development of productivity in our region. The agriculture, energy, transportation, communication, S&T, education, people’s daily necessities, and raw material industries that the central government proposes to protect are also the weak links in Mindong and also the aspects that Mindong must strengthen. By utilizing governance, rectification, and deepening reforms, we can either eliminate heat or transfer that heat. This then promotes the optimal combination of production factors and promotes the rational adjustment of the industrial structure."
"Reflections on the Economic Development of Mindong——Interview with Comrade Xi Jinping, Secretary of the CCP Ningde Prefectural Committee","Academic Review , Xi Jinping","Mar 2, 1989",Q: You come from the open area of Xiamen. What experience do you think Xiamen can learn from the opening of a poor area like Mindong?
"Reflections on the Economic Development of Mindong——Interview with Comrade Xi Jinping, Secretary of the CCP Ningde Prefectural Committee","Academic Review , Xi Jinping","Mar 2, 1989","XJP: The openness of a place is subject to the improvement of soft and hard environments. The practice of opening up in many places in recent years has proved that tax breaks are not all that attractive. Foreign businessmen not only want to save money but are rather more concerned about making more money and ask for things to be done well and neatly. What can make a big difference in Mindong is the construction of a soft environment, such as simplifying procedures, reducing costs, improving work efficiency, and improving service quality, which are all very attractive aspects. Ningde and Xiapu, which are included in the open counties, should become the pilot areas for the whole region to open up. I especially feel that it is important to have an open mind. We also need to avoid the Matthew Effect of opening up. Open areas will become more open, and closed areas will become more closed. Opening up requires certain conditions, and poor areas lack those conditions."
"Reflections on the Economic Development of Mindong——Interview with Comrade Xi Jinping, Secretary of the CCP Ningde Prefectural Committee","Academic Review , Xi Jinping","Mar 2, 1989","Q: Economic development requires clean politics.

"Reflections on the Economic Development of Mindong——Interview with Comrade Xi Jinping, Secretary of the CCP Ningde Prefectural Committee","Academic Review , Xi Jinping","Mar 2, 1989","XJP: Whether the Party and government organs are kept clean or not is related to the survival of the Party and the support of people’s hearts, and of course, it will affect the fate of the socialist economy. Nowadays, the masses loudly proclaim four demands, and I believe they can be used as a wake-up call. The first saying is “if it does not belong to me, I will have nothing of it, not even the smallest bit.” I feel that this is a minimum requirement for a Party member and cadre. The second saying is that “one cannot have both the fish and the bear paw.” You cannot both wish to be an official and also hope to get rich. If you wish to be a cadre, you cannot wish to become rich. If you wish to become rich, go into business and start an enterprise. The third saying is that “so long as one’s heart is pure, all things will become clear.” Corruption, bribery, and wanton bullying of the people are not permissible under the statutes of Party discipline and state law. The fourth saying is “government officials should bring benefit to the people in their jurisdiction.” The purpose of being a cadre is to give, and the “copying” doctrine is unacceptable. Officials must not seek benefits or personal gain."

Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","In order to discuss and summarize China’s international security crisis behavior, we must first provide clear and accurate definitions of key terms and our research object."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011",(i) On international military security crises
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","As normally defined, international military security crises refers to a situation where the relationships between countries are in a dangerous state where military conflict or even war may erupt. Such a crisis involves three factors: First, the core or major interests of the parties involved in the crisis are threatened. Second, there is a time limit or a sense of urgency. Third, there is a serious danger of military conflict. 1"
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","An international military security crisis is conceptually different from an international security crisis. The former is only a subset of the latter. International security crisis has a more expansive definition, including both traditional and non-traditional international security crises. The concept of an international military security crisis basically overlaps with the concept of a traditional international security crisis, mainly involving disputes over territory and sovereignty as well as geopolitical conflicts. In addition, under the new situation, it also involves certain non-traditional security crises, such as international terrorism crises and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. However, it is quite different from more non-traditional international security crises, such as financial crises, energy scarcity crises, and international crises that may be caused by climate change, environmental pollution, and the international spread of infectious diseases. The latter usually does not have the potential of directly triggering a military conflict."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","International military security crises are divided into potential and actual. When a relevant country (or countries) has a conflict of interest in military security, but the degree of confrontation or external conditions have not yet reached a certain critical point, the crisis is in the latent stage. At this stage, the crisis is called a potential crisis. When the degree of confrontation intensifies or the conflict of interests is rapidly exacerbated due to changes in external conditions, the possibility of military conflict increases sharply, and the potential crisis becomes an actual crisis. Of course, there are also some crises that persist for a long time with alternating periods of high and low intensity, so it is hard to divide them into potential and actual crises. In these crises, the sense of urgency is relatively diminished, but the inherent conflict of interests and the risk of triggering a military conflict are always there."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","Some international military security crises are called quasi-crises because their nature and extent are somewhat different. These crises involve relatively serious conflicts of military security interests and time pressure and may cause serious damage to the political and diplomatic relations of the relevant countries, but generally do not lead to military conflicts and wars.2 Such crises are mostly sudden or unexpected events that produce limited direct consequences. But even in such crises, the possibility of a misfire accidentally triggering a military conflict [擦枪走火, to accidentally shoot a gun while polishing it] remains serious. In addition, given the extreme urgency in time, the risk of a military conflict will rise sharply in the event of a miscalculation of the nature of the crisis."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011",(ii) On military confrontation and crisis management
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","In the face of an international military security crisis, crisis participants usually have two types of approaches: One approach is to determine to resolve conflicts of interest by military means in order to safeguard one’s own interests, even at the cost of war. This paper defines this approach as military confrontation. A military confrontation may be a proactive decision, an action forced upon the actor, or the result of the failure of crisis management. Another approach is to strive to safeguard one’s own interests on the one hand, while making every effort to control the risk of crisis escalation, prevent the outbreak of military conflicts, and gradually mitigate the crisis on the other hand. This is crisis management. In the process of crisis management, the two sides involved in the crisis usually adopt various crisis negotiation strategies, both gamesmanship and cooperation, both conflict and compromise. In most cases, successful military crisis management does not seek to resolve conflicts of interest, but rather looks to avoid worst-case scenarios.3"
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","In addition to the two clearly different crisis behaviors described above, a third situation sometimes occurs, whether crisis management is the main approach, but it is supplemented by military confrontation, with the latter approach serving the former. In this case, the degree of military confrontation is limited."

Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","According to the above definitions, the research content of this paper involves the main international military security crises experienced by New China, including actual crises, potential crises, and quasi-crises. Such crises either occur directly between China and foreign countries, or although they occur between other countries, they lead to intervention by China because they have a significant impact on China’s national security interests. Among these crises, the Taiwan Strait crisis is particularly distinctive. The Taiwan question is a part of China’s internal affairs, but due to the long-term U.S. policy of interference in Taiwan, this issue has a certain “international character.” Military conflicts and crises between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have repeatedly triggered military security crises between China and the United States."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","Among the many international military security crises that China has experienced, some have directly triggered military confrontations between China and foreign countries. Others have triggered military conflicts or even wars, although both crisis management and military confrontation have been combined in the development of the crises. Still, others were contained or mitigated by the practice of crisis management. This paper deals with two major international military security crisis behaviors practiced by China—military confrontation and crisis management. However, the focus of our research is on crisis management. The former approach is involved in order to better study and explain the latter, and to demonstrate the profound changes in China’s behavior in international military security crises."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","Many non-traditional security crises that are quite different from military security crises are outside the scope of this study, but the global nuclear proliferation crisis, especially around China’s periphery, provides an important context for our study. In addition, we should point out that, after the start of the 21st century, the crises and challenges brought about by international terrorism have attracted more and more attention from China. So far, China has been less involved in international crisis management in this area, but in the long run, it is inevitable that China will gradually intervene more in the future."

Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","When the People’s Republic of China was founded in 1949, the Cold War had already begun, and it lasted for more than 40 years after China’s founding. During this period, faced with frequent international military security crises, China repeatedly intervened in or became involved in military conflicts and wars."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","The Indochina War was the first war in which New China intervened. Shortly after the end of World War II, the Indochinese Communist Party, led by Ho Chi Minh, launched a struggle against French colonialism. In early 1950, they requested that China send troops to join the war. At that time, because they wanted to support the national liberation movement and eliminate the threat of Western colonial forces facing China’s periphery, the Chinese leaders did not hesitate to make the decision to aid Vietnam in resisting the French. However, after careful consideration, they decided not to send troops to join the war directly, but to intervene by sending a military advisory group and providing weapons and material assistance. In 1953, after the war in Indochina entered a state where the forces were evenly balanced, France tried to seek a compromise, but the United States wanted France to continue to fight, and actively planned to send troops to aid the French. Under these conditions, China participated in the Geneva Conference and worked hard on all parties to the conflict, especially the Vietnamese side. China made important contributions to the signing4 of the Geneva Armistice Agreement in July 1954."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","The Korean War was a major local war in which China was directly involved. The Korean War erupted on June 25, 1950. Very quickly, U.S. military intervention turned a Korean civil war into an international war and posed a serious threat to China’s national security. The Chinese leaders decided to prepare in two ways: On the one hand, they ordered troops to quickly concentrate on the border between China and North Korea, and on the other hand, they actively carried out diplomatic activities in the hope of easing tensions and preventing the war from expanding and directly involving China.5 At that time, China and the United States had no diplomatic relations, communication was very difficult, and there was a serious lack of mutual understanding. Due to these as well as other reasons, the United States wrongly judged that China could not send troops to take part in the war.6 After the U.S. military ignored a series of warnings from China in crossing the “38th parallel” on a large scale and approaching the Yalu River, the long-brewing major military confrontation became a reality even though both sides had wanted to avoid it. From October 19, 1950, when the Volunteers secretly crossed the Yalu River and went on to push the U.S. military back to the “38th parallel” to the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement on July 27, 1953, the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea lasted for nearly three years. This war had a significant and far-reaching influence on the subsequent strengthening of military security crisis management between China and the United States."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","In 1954 and 1958, China twice launched military struggles against Taiwan in the Taiwan Strait known as the “shelling of Kinmen.” The goal of the former struggle (August 1954 to May of the following year) was to liberate the islands off the coast of Zhejiang, combat the harassment by Chiang Kai-shek’s army toward the coast of the mainland, and prevent the United States from signing a military alliance treaty with the Taiwan region. The goal of the latter struggle (August to October 1958) was to counter the harassment by Chiang’s army of the mainland of the motherland, take the opportunity to seize the islands off the coast of Fujian occupied by Chiang, and clarify the scope of the Mutual Defense Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of China.7 In the two crises in the Taiwan Strait, the United States responded strongly both times, not only concentrating its forces on the Taiwan Strait, but also publicly issuing nuclear threats to China. Chinese leaders insisted on the military struggle against Taiwan, while at the same time trying to avoid direct military conflict with the United States. 8 They did not end military operations until some of the goals of the military struggle were achieved. Through these two military struggles, Chinese leaders clearly identified the bottom lines of the U.S. side and made important judgments: The United States is determined to protect the Taiwan region militarily, but it does not support the use of China’s coastal islands by Taiwan authorities to harass the mainland and is even less willing to become involved in a military conflict between the two sides of the strait on these islands; the Taiwan issue will be protracted due to U.S. interference. Mao Zedong decided to adjust his policy. He abandoned the original plan to capture the two islands of Kinmen and Matsu in order to oppose the United States’ attempt to create “two Chinas.”"
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","In 1962, a serious military conflict occurred between China and India concerning a territorial dispute. In the autumn of 1959, armed men from the two countries exchanged fire on the border for the first time. At that time, in order to ease tensions, China proposed to India in November that the two sides retreat from the Line of Actual Control, and unilaterally retreated 20 kilometers after the Indian side rejected the suggestion. In early 1960, after negotiating with some neighboring countries to demarcate boundary lines, China once again gave a concrete proposal to India for the signing of a boundary agreement, but this was once again rejected by the Indian side. At the end of 1961, India began to send troops to encroach on the disputed western sector. Then, in June of the following year, it began to cross the Line of Actual Control between the two sides in the disputed eastern sector in order to set up military points.9 In the face of China’s renewed proposal for negotiations, India stated that it could only discuss the issue of China’s “withdrawal.” In this situation, Chinese leaders made the judgment that India was taking advantage of the difficulties faced by China 10 to forcibly change the status quo on the border using a policy of military encroachment. In order to maintain the status quo along the border and maintain the stability of the border, China decided to conduct a border self-defense counterattack against India. On October 20, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) launched an attack on the invading Indian army. In late November, China announced a ceasefire and withdrew its troops within 20 kilometers of the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","The effort to aid Vietnam to resist the United States was China’s longest indirect military conflict with the United States during the Cold War. In August 1964, the United States comprehensively escalated the Vietnam War and began a policy of “strike the south and bomb the north” against Vietnam. China responded strongly, clearly announcing that it would send personnel to Vietnam to fight the U.S. military and attack any U.S. planes that invaded Chinese airspace.11 At the same time, China still hoped to prevent a direct large-scale military conflict with the United States and prevent the flames of the Vietnam War from spreading within China’s borders. In the first half of 1965, Chinese leaders sent the following messages to the United States through various channels: China had no intention of provoking a war against the United States, China’s response would be reciprocal, the United States must not cross the 17th parallel, and China would not send troops to southern Vietnam. If U.S. military operations against northern Vietnam were limited to naval and air operations, the participation of Chinese troops in the north would be limited to combat support.12 This time, the United States clearly noted the signals sent by China. Up to the end of the war, the United States did not launch a ground war against northern Vietnam, and it always strictly prohibited U.S. military aircraft from entering China on combat missions. After 1968, as the war transitioned to “Vietnamization,” the military security crisis between China and the United States gradually eased. In 1970, all Chinese support troops withdrew to China.13 In this crisis, the format and outcome of the confrontation between China and the United States were very different than in the Korean War. The two countries not only avoided direct military conflict, but also embarked on the road of de-escalation before the crisis was concluded.14"

Under favorable circumstances, Chinese leaders decided to launch a self-defense counterattack against the South Vietnamese navy that had invaded the waters off the Xisha Islands. In one stroke, the Chinese recovered their islands that had been occupied by the South Vietnamese regime."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","In 1969, a serious border conflict broke out between China and the Soviet Union. The direct cause was a territorial boundary dispute, but the deeper context was the intensification of ideological differences between the two parties and the overall breakdown of the relationship between the two countries. Before the outbreak of the conflict, the friction between the two sides along the eastern sector of the border was intensifying, and it had progressed to the point of an imminent eruption. Faced with the high-pressure policies adopted by the Soviet Union, Chinese leaders decided to respond in kind and make no concessions. In March and August 1969, the border guards of both sides participated in armed clashes, first on Zhenbao Island in the eastern sector of the border and then at Tielieketi in the western sector. Faced with a very severe situation, Mao Zedong issued a call to the whole country to “prepare for war,” and China entered a war footing. The Soviet Union accelerated the deployment of troops to the border area between the two countries, doubling its troop strength in a short period of time, and issued a nuclear threat to China. In September of the same year, a meeting between the premiers of the two countries at the Beijing airport eased the atmosphere of confrontation. However, the consensus to ease the conflict and maintain the status quo on the border reached during the meeting was not supported by the top leaders of the two countries, so the meeting resulted in failure. Afterward, Sino-Soviet relations remained in a state of complete confrontation for a long time."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","China’s final foreign military conflict during the Cold War occurred in 1979. Starting even before the reunification of Vietnam in 1975, historical grievances, disputes over territorial and maritime rights, and strategic differences between China and Vietnam gradually emerged. In 1977, Vietnam invaded Cambodia, and Sino-Vietnamese relations deteriorated sharply. In 1978, with the support of the Soviet Union, Vietnam aggressively attacked Cambodia, igniting the fuse that set off a Sino-Vietnamese military conflict. In order to maintain its own and regional security and oppose the expansion of the Soviet Union and Vietnam in the Indochinese Peninsula region, in the autumn of 1978, Deng Xiaoping and other Chinese leaders decided to conduct a self-defense counterattack against Vietnam. To this end, China actively conducted diplomatic actions15 and fully prepared for the possibility of Soviet intervention. The operation started in February 1979. After reaching their basic combat objectives in March, the Chinese troops completely withdrew from Vietnam. From 1980, China continued to carry out small-scale follow-up cross-border combat operations against Vietnam.16 In March 1988, China and Vietnam fought a battle in the Nansha Islands (Spratly Islands), and the Chinese navy subsequently recovered some islands and reefs occupied by Vietnam."

At that time, China provided military assistance to Pakistan at the request of the Pakistani government. In particular, in 1965, Chinese leaders made an explicit decision to send troops to assist Pakistan when necessary. Because India took measures to retreat from the Sino-Sikkim border after receiving an “ultimatum note” from China, China did not ultimately send troops.17"

Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","The Cold War ended in 1991. Since then, in the region and on the global scale, various military security crises have continued to occur from time to time. However, there has been a significant reduction in crises directly between China and foreign countries, and China has not been involved in any more international military conflicts."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","The Mischief Reef incident between China and the Philippines in 1995 presents a microcosm of the South China Sea dispute between China and five Southeast Asian countries. In January of that year, China sent a scientific research vessel to conduct a scientific investigation of the Mischief Reef in the Nansha islands and build shelters for fishermen on the reef. The Philippine government not only rapidly sent more troops to the disputed area, but also took a variety of actions to intensify the conflict on the grounds that “Chinese warships” had “invaded” its territorial waters and built “military facilities” on Mischief Reef.18 Given this situation, countries involved in other disputes in Southeast Asia intervened one after another and stepped up their activities in the waters of the Nansha Islands. The Mischief Reef incident became the focus of the international community’s attention for some time. After the incident, the Chinese government strengthened its vigilance on the relevant waters of the Nansha Islands to resolutely safeguard China’s legitimate rights and interests on the one hand. On the other hand, it insisted on conducting diplomacy with the Philippine government and opposed its practice of increasing tensions and internationalizing disputes between the two countries. At the end of July, at the China-ASEAN Foreign Ministers’ Dialogue, China put forward a comprehensive position on resolving the Nansha dispute, expressing its willingness to peacefully resolve the dispute with relevant countries in accordance with international law and the principles of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. This proposal was welcomed by all participants. Since then, the tensions produced by the Mischief Reef incident have gradually eased."

The crisis was caused by the U.S. government’s blatant violation of its promise and its allowance of Taiwanese leader Lee Teng-hui to visit the United States. The Chinese government responded strongly, first interrupting all dialogue and exchanges between the two countries, recalling the ambassador to the United States, and then conducting a series of military exercises and missile tests in the Taiwan Strait in June and July of 1995. In March 1996, in response to the “presidential” election in the Taiwan region, China decided to conduct additional missile test launches and military exercises. The U.S. government was highly tense and urgently discussed military deployment to the Taiwan Strait. They decided to send two aircraft carrier groups to the Taiwan Strait. In the face of this serious situation, China remained steadfast and insisted on completing the scheduled missile test launches and large-scale joint land, sea, and air military exercises. On March 28, the PLA’s joint military exercise ended, the same day as the end of the “presidential” election in Taiwan and the arrival of the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz in the Western Pacific. Afterward, the crisis in the Taiwan Strait significantly eased. Taiwan decided to cancel its planned military exercise, and the U.S. Navy quietly left. After this test of strength, the United States gained a new understanding and awareness of the sensitivity of the Taiwan issue,19 and the Taiwan authorities’ attempt to change the one-China framework by pursuing “Pragmatic Diplomacy” was suppressed. During this crisis, both China and the United States wanted to avoid military conflict, and the two sides maintained necessary lines of communication.20 In this crisis, there was no military confrontation between China and the United States in the true sense.21"

In addition, on the basis of maintaining the status quo in the Taiwan Strait, China is actively working to cooperate with the United States and the main opposition parties on the island of Taiwan against “Taiwan independence”. China’s efforts have created strong and effective political, military, and diplomatic pressure on the “Taiwan independence” forces so that all their attempts to provoke a Taiwan Strait crisis have failed in succession. Since the spring of 2008, Cross-Strait relations have undergone major changes, entering a new stage of rapid improvement and development."

Relatively speaking, the bombing was a more sudden and serious event than the plane collision25, but the plane collision was more complex26 and entailed greater risks than the bombing.27 At the time, despite their lack of experience in dealing with such emergencies,28 Chinese leaders nevertheless quickly took a series of measures to gradually ease the two crises. China’s basic response policy was to resolutely defend the country’s sovereignty and dignity, fight against the wrongful behavior of the United States, and at the same time, strive to maintain the general situation of Sino-U.S. relations and strive to avoid confrontation. Tensions after the bombing incident began to ease after the United States apologized many times and paid corresponding compensation. The collision incident was finally resolved by adopting separate methods to deal with the pilot and the machine29. These two events allowed Chinese leaders to accumulate valuable experience in dealing with sudden crises. Since then, China’s security crisis management coordination mechanisms have been significantly strengthened."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","A crisis also broke out between China and Japan in 2004 due to disputes over maritime rights and interests. In May of that year, Japanese media began to report extensively on China’s development of oil and gas fields in the East China Sea, claiming that Chinese oil and gas exploration west of the “middle line” would siphon off oil and gas resources belonging to Japan. Japan unreasonably accused China of trying to monopolize the seabed resources of the East China Sea. This required the government to take decisive measures to defend Japan’s maritime rights and interests.30 The Japanese government immediately strengthened its military reconnaissance and oil and gas resources investigation in the relevant waters and made “stern representations” to China. The disputes between China and Japan over oil and gas development and the demarcation of the East China Sea abruptly heated up. The East China Sea dispute aggravated public opinion and increased political tensions in the already fierce confrontation between the two countries,31 and calls that “China and Japan must go to war” began to be heard. In the face of a highly tense situation, the Chinese government resolutely safeguarded its national sovereignty and rights and rejected all unreasonable demands from the Japanese. At the same time, it clearly put forward to the Japanese a proposal for joint development in the disputed area and for dialogue concerning the dispute. In addition, the Chinese government also strengthened coordination between relevant departments and the guidance of public opinion, in an effort to prevent the occurrence of a misfire in the East China Sea that could trigger a military conflict. In October of that year, China and Japan began negotiations on the East China Sea, and the tensions in the East China Sea dispute were brought under control."

During the India-Pakistan nuclear crisis32, China fully cooperated with the other member states in the UN Security Council33 to bring the crisis under control relatively quickly. In the face of the North Korean nuclear crisis,34 China consistently maintained close contact and consultation with relevant parties including North Korea and the United States, viewing the Six-Party Talks as the main platform to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, while supporting the necessary role played by the Security Council.35 In addition, China has also strengthened coordination among relevant domestic departments and its own military preparedness. In response to the Iranian nuclear crisis,36 from participating in discussions at the International Atomic Energy Council to participating in the UN Security Council consultations, from participating in the Six-Nation Talks to directly working with Iran, China’s involvement in the management of the Iranian nuclear crisis has gradually deepened and its influence has gradually expanded.37"

At the time, China actively participated in international cooperation to fight terrorism, but did not approve of the so-called “War on Terror” fought by the United States around the world. It was even more opposed to the “pre-emptive” military strikes conducted by the United States against other countries in the name of fighting terrorism. Facing the tense situation resulting from the decision by the United States and the UK to use force against Iraq, China called for a political solution to the Iraqi issue within the framework of the United Nations and opposed the Security Council’s automatic authorization of the United States to use force against Iraq39. Together with many countries, it waged a fierce contest with the United States and the UK. Although these efforts failed to prevent the United States and the UK from starting a war, they upheld international morality and the UN Security Council’s basic principles of maintaining peace and security. In the end, the Security Council did not give the green light to the United States and the UK to use force against Iraq. At that time, China not only coordinated and cooperated with major powers with similar positions such as France, Germany, and Russia, but also fought against countries with opposite positions such as the United States and the UK. With the Security Council as the main diplomatic platform, bilateral consultations and summit diplomacy were also frequently carried out. This allowed China to accumulate many new experiences in international military security crisis management."

Facing a state of emergency in which Japan detained the Chinese fishing boat and crew members and claimed that the incident would be handled in accordance with domestic law, China first made urgent and solemn representations to Japan through diplomatic channels. While Japan continued to detain the Chinese captain, China went on to announce the suspension of all exchanges between the two countries at the vice-ministerial level and above, showing its uncompromising attitude towards the incorrect practices adopted by Japan. During the crisis, the two sides maintained necessary diplomatic contacts. The crisis gradually eased after Japan released the Chinese captain on the 24th of the same month.41 In December, the leaders of the two countries held their first official meeting since the crisis on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting in Tokyo.

Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","From the above overview of China’s response to international military security crises, we can clearly see that, over the past 60 years, China’s crisis behavior has followed a trajectory from military confrontation to crisis management, from conflict avoidance to mutual benefit."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","Faced with frequent international military security crises during the Cold War, China five times decided to directly adopt military confrontation to deal with crises, namely, to aid Vietnam and resist France, in the Sino-Soviet conflict on Zhenbao Island, in the Sino-Vietnamese (southern Vietnam) Battle of Xisha, in the self-defense counterattack against Vietnam, and in the Sino-Vietnamese (North Vietnam) Nansha skirmish. In these cases, military confrontation was the clear choice made by China."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","During the same period, there were also five occasions where China adopted both crisis management and military confrontation, including resisting the United States and assisting North Korea, the two military struggles in the Taiwan Strait, assisting Vietnam and resisting the United States, and the Sino-Indian border counterattack. Among these cases, before becoming involved in the Korean War and the military conflict with India, China had made crisis management efforts to try to de-escalate the crisis and avoid conflict but failed in this aim. In the two military struggles against Taiwan and when aiding Vietnam and resisting the United States, China carried out military strikes against the Taiwan military and limited its involvement in the Vietnam War. At the same time, China actively managed the crisis and avoided direct military confrontation with the United States. In these cases, military confrontation was still one of the important options for China to deal with the crises."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","Taking the above two together, China intervened or became involved in 10 military conflicts and wars during the Cold War. In addition, China almost dispatched troops to intervene in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. “Military confrontation is the main approach, supplemented by crisis management” was the main feature of China’s international military security crisis behavior during this period."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","Since the end of the Cold War, various international military and security crises have continued to occur frequently, but China has not yet experienced any foreign military conflicts so far. Crisis events have directly occurred between China and foreign countries, such as the Sino-Philippines Mischief Reef incident, the Taiwan Strait crisis, the “embassy bombing incident”, the “Sino-U.S. plane collision incident”, the Sino-Japan East China Sea Crisis, and the Diaoyu Islands Collision Incident, all of which were brought under control or controlled relatively well. Especially concerning the Taiwan issue, while maintaining the right to use force, China extended crisis management from between China and the United States to between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, demonstrating the greatest determination and desire to strive for peaceful reunification."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","At the same time, some disputes over territory and maritime rights and interests that have historically led to battlefield confrontations between Chinese and foreign forces have been completely resolved, such as the Sino-Soviet/Russian border dispute, the Sino-Vietnamese land border dispute, and the Beibu Gulf (Tonkin Gulf) delimitation dispute. Others have been brought under better control without triggering new military security crises, such as Sino-Indian territorial disputes42 and Sino-Vietnamese maritime disputes."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","In addition, China has also intervened in the management of major international military security crises such as the India-Pakistan nuclear crisis, the Iraq crisis, the North Korean nuclear crisis, and the Iranian nuclear crisis. China made active efforts to control the escalation of these crises, avoid military conflicts, and seek long-term and comprehensive solutions. In these crises, China was not a party or a major party to the crises, but they posed a major threat to regional and world security, involved huge risks of causing military conflicts or even wars, and they all occurred in areas around China or in areas of interest to China. Therefore, with the rise of China’s national strength and international influence, China’s involvement in these international military security crises has gradually increased."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","In short, the most notable changes in China’s crisis behavior since the 1990s are: Military confrontation, China’s main approach during the Cold War, has been replaced by crisis management; foreign military conflict, a phenomenon that recurred in crises during the Cold War, has been avoided with active crisis management; with the strengthening of crisis management, important changes have taken place in the conditions that led potential crises to often become actual crises during the Cold War, so that now some potential crises tend to be weakened and resolved and other potential crises have been effectively controlled; efforts to find long-term solutions to conflicts of interest and achieve mutually beneficial outcomes have started to become the direction of China’s efforts."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","In fact, the starting point of this major shift in China’s behavior in international military security crises may be traced back even earlier to the early 1980s. For the decade or so from this time to the end of the Cold War in 1991, there was a significant reduction in China’s foreign military conflicts, with the only exception being small-scale military conflicts between China and Vietnam. In addition, before the outbreak of the Gulf War in 1990, in order to achieve Iraq’s withdrawal from Kuwait in order to resolve the Gulf crisis peacefully, China began to use diplomatic mediation, taking an important step in the direction of intervening in the management of an international military security crisis.43"
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011",(ii) Development and changes in crisis decision/management mechanisms
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","China’s decisionmaking/management mechanisms for international military security crises have always been determined by China’s national security leadership system and its operations. Since the founding of the People’s Republic of China, China’s national security leadership system has been relatively stable and continuous. Its basic arrangement is as follows: Major diplomatic and military decisions are made by the Politburo of the CCP Central Committee and the Politburo Standing Committee. The Secretariat of the Central Committee is responsible for handling the daily work of the Central Committee, including matters related to national security. The State Council, the Central Military Commission, the relevant leading groups of the CCP Central Committee, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and relevant national security departments are involved in handling specific matters related to national security.44"
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","However, in the past few decades, the operation of China’s national security leadership system has undergone three major changes, which have had different effects on the country’s military security crisis decisionmaking/management mechanisms. The first change was during the ten-year “Cultural Revolution,” when Party and government organizations at all levels were paralyzed or rendered ineffective. The original central collective leadership system was severely damaged. An extremely abnormal situation occurred, where decisionmaking was limited to a very small number of people, and final decisions were made by Mao Zedong alone. Under these circumstances, China’s decisionmaking for international military security crises suffered a significantly negative effect. The second change was that, with the end of the “Cultural Revolution,” the operation of the national security leadership system returned to normal, and a central leadership collective with Deng Xiaoping at its core was formed. Under these circumstances, China’s decisionmaking/management mechanisms for international military security crises were strengthened. The third change was when the older generation of leaders withdrew from the national political arena. China’s national security decisionmaking began a major shift from relying mainly on the experience of a few leaders45 to relying mainly on the top leadership collective for institutionalized decisionmaking. This transition is still ongoing. This change has accelerated the process of improving and strengthening China’s international military security crisis management mechanisms."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","Since the late 1990s, for major security and foreign policy decisions, the Politburo Standing Committee has had the highest decisionmaking authority. In this group, top party and state leaders play a central role. In the face of different military security crisis events, the Central Foreign Affairs Leading Group, the Central National Security Leading Group46, the Central Leading Group for Taiwan Work, and the Central Military Commission respectively undertake the main tasks of policy formulation.47 The Foreign Affairs Office of the CCP Central Committee, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the General Staff Department, and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the Central Committee (the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council) are responsible for internal coordination, formulating crisis management plans, and proposing countermeasures and suggestions. Numerous relevant functional departments and national think tanks are gradually starting to participate in policy coordination."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","External communication mechanisms including hotlines, emergency liaison systems, special envoys, and second-track contacts have been initially established.48 For example, China and the United States have established a hotline between heads of state and a military hotline. China and Russia have established a hotline between heads of state. China and Japan have established a hotline between prime ministers/premiers and are discussing the establishment of an emergency liaison system between the navies and air forces of the two countries. China and South Korea have established direct telephone lines between the navies and air forces of the two countries. The practice of dispatching special envoys has been used many times in handling the Taiwan Strait crisis, the North Korean nuclear crisis, and some other international crises. Various second-track mechanisms have also played a role in helping decision-makers understand the real situation and explore solutions during some crisis events."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","Due to the development of informatization and the increasing influence of public opinion, during crisis events, the Chinese government increasingly focuses on listening to and guiding public opinion. The establishment of relevant coordination mechanisms played an important role in handling the Sino-U.S. plane collision, tensions in the Taiwan Strait, Sino-Japanese political and security frictions, the North Korean nuclear crisis, and other security disagreements between China and foreign countries. In addition, in the past 20 to 30 years, information intelligence work has been greatly developed and strengthened as an important part of China’s national security decisionmaking mechanisms and military security crisis decisionmaking/management mechanisms. The ability of foreign affairs, news, military, security, and other departments to collect information and intelligence has been significantly improved,49 and the ability of relevant leading departments to comprehensively evaluate information and intelligence has continuously strengthened. This has played an important role in ensuring that Chinese leaders make timely and accurate decisions on various military security crises.50"
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011",(iii) Development and changes in crisis management principles and behavioral paradigms
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","Over the past 60 years, Chinese leaders have formed some basic crisis management principles and behavioral paradigms through their abundant practice in dealing with various military security crises. These principles and paradigms are of great significance for guiding and understanding China’s international military security crisis behavior."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","These crisis management principles first came from some important strategic and tactical ideas formed by the older generation of Chinese leaders such as Mao Zedong during the long-term revolutionary struggle. For example, “Strategically despise the enemy but tactically respect him”—we must combine courage and skill in fighting and unify a principled approach to strategy and a flexible approach to tactics; or “on just grounds, to our advantage, and with rational restraint”—we must uphold the “defensive,” “local,” and “temporary nature” of the fight while acting in accord with morality, so as to achieve “self-defense,” “victory,” and an “end of hostilities” altogether; or “respond in kind” [以两手对两手, literally: use two hands against two hands]—we must adopt both hard and soft approaches, talk when we are talked to, and strike when we are struck, and practice both cooperation and struggle; or “promises must be kept and action must be resolute”—once we show our determination to act and our bottom line, we must say what we mean and back up our words with deeds. Since the founding of New China, these strategic and tactical ideas have been extensively applied in the practice of successive Chinese leaders when dealing with international military and security crises. Up to the present, they still play an important guiding role in crisis management and are recognized by the Chinese strategic research community as crisis management principles with Chinese characteristics."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","However, with the development and changes in the international security situation and the increasing awareness of the dangers of military security crises and the importance of crisis management, China’s crisis management principles are also developing and changing, with their content being continuously enriched and improved. Since the end of the Cold War, while implementing new practices for dealing with foreign relations, including various international military security crises, Chinese leaders have also put forward many new principles and policies from various perspectives, such as adhering to the UN Charter and the norms of international law and seek authorization for the use of force against other countries from the UN Security Council except in cases of self-defense; always grasp the overall situation of the country’s overall relations and insist on “fighting without breaking” [斗而不破, competing with an adversary but avoiding military conflict]; prioritize peaceful dialogue, increase trust, and avoid confrontation; and give equal importance to crisis prevention and crisis control.51 In addition, some research results52 from the Chinese strategic research community have been valued highly by relevant functional departments in the Chinese government. This has supplemented and refined China’s principles for the management of international military security crises."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","The principles of crisis management mentioned above are not all at the same level. I do not intend to classify them here, but one thing is certain, which is that China’s military security crisis management principles have already developed a great deal. They not only carry on the tradition but also innovate. They not only adhere to Chinese characteristics but also draw on the experience of other countries and are gradually aligning with international practice. The main focus has been on achieving the transformation from an approach that gives prominence to struggle to one that takes into account both struggle and compromise."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","Compared with the development and changes in military security crisis management principles, China’s military security crisis management behavior paradigm53 has remained relatively stable over the past 60 years. From the “Overview of Crisis Response” section above, it is clearly apparent that some basic practices have appeared repeatedly in China’s management of international military security crises, including issuing timely diplomatic warnings, taking certain military actions to demonstrate credible deterrence,54 always fighting in self-defense and never firing the first shot, seeking necessary compromises in the contest in order to maintain long-term and overall interests, and valuing morality and “face” (that is, always putting the maintenance of international justice and the maintenance of the dignity of the nation and the people in a very prominent position).55"
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","In fact, over the past 10 years, as its crisis management mechanism and guiding principles have developed and changed, China’s relatively stable international military crisis management paradigm has also shown some subtle but important changes, the most important of which are the following four: first, China started to use more non-military means such as diplomacy rather than military actions to send warning signals; second, China pays more attention to acting in accordance with international law and seeking legitimacy for its actions; third, China is strengthening efforts to build security confidence measures with relevant parties; and fourth, China pays more attention to seeking mutual compromises and concessions, striving to achieve win-win situations and avoid a lose-lose situation. These developments and changes have made China’s international military security crisis management more reasonable and effective and increased the predictability of China’s military security crisis behavior."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011",(iv) Reasons for changes in crisis behavior
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","China’s international military security crisis behavior is not the result of arbitrary choices by Chinese leaders. Rather, it is determined by multiple international and domestic factors. Among them, the most influential are the international strategic landscape, the relationship between China and the international system, the central mission and ideology of the CCP and the nation, and the resulting Chinese concept of the international security order.56"
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","In general, during the Cold War period when the United States and the Soviet Union were competing for hegemony, and especially in the first 30 years after the victory of the Chinese revolution, due to the severe hostilities with the United States and then the Soviet Union and its policy of alignment, due to long-term exclusion from major international organizations such as the United Nations, due to the fact that the world was still in the era of revolution and war, and a new world war would be hard to avoid, and due to the long-term policies of “taking class struggle as the key link” and opposing “imperialism, revisionism, and counter-revolution”, plus the fact that Mao Zedong and other Chinese leaders had the experience of leading a long-term revolutionary war to achieve national independence and liberation and a unique understanding of crises, it should come as no surprise that New China intervened or became involved in one military conflict after another. At that time, it was subjectively difficult to make crisis management the main approach by which Chinese leaders dealt with military security crises, while efforts to avoid military conflicts were also limited in effect due to the lack of necessary objective conditions. Military conflict is the main approach, supplemented by crisis management was the main feature of China’s international military security crisis behavior during this period."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","During the final period of the Cold War, and especially since the end of the Cold War, with the continuous development of multi-polarization, globalization, and informatization, China’s international environment and surrounding environment have undergone tremendous changes. Bipolar confrontation has disappeared, peace and development have become the themes of the age, and the forms and roles of war have also undergone profound changes.57 With the emergence of a new pattern of major power relations and the overall improvement of China’s relations with neighboring countries, China no longer faces major direct military threats. Domestically, Chinese leaders have abandoned the erroneous policy of “taking class struggle as the key link” and continued to develop reform and opening up with modernization at the center. In order to adapt to the changes described above, Deng Xiaoping proposed that world wars could be avoided and China should implement an independent foreign policy of peace and diplomacy and a policy of non-alignment,58 adhere to peaceful development, and actively integrate into the international community. After entering the 21st century, Chinese leaders such as Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao proposed a new security concept centered on “mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, and cooperation”. They proposed that China would always “hold high the banner of peaceful development and cooperation” and be a responsible major power and that China would “build a harmonious world and strive for mutual benefit.” Under this new situation, the views of Chinese leaders concerning crises have changed significantly,59 and crisis management was highly valued by the Chinese government and China’s strategic research community.60 Resolving disputes and avoiding military conflicts and wars through dialogue not only became an important means of maintaining security, but also a major goal for maintaining national, regional, and global security. Crisis management replaced military confrontation, becoming the main feature of China’s crisis behavior during this period."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","It is worth pointing out that, in the context described above, the improvement and strengthening of China’s security crisis management mechanisms, the enrichment and development of its crisis management principles, the significant rise of China’s position in international mechanisms, and the remarkable progress of national defense modernization61 have all greatly strengthened China’s ability to conduct crisis management.  This makes it possible for China to manage international military security crises more effectively and to actively participate in the management of some regional and even global military security crises."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011",It is precisely because of the strong awareness of and desire for crisis management and the significant improvement in crisis management capability that China’s international military security crisis behavior has undergone such huge and profound changes.

Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011",The various international military and security crises facing China have and continue to undergo profound changes.
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","For a long time, the international military and security crises that China has dealt with can be divided into three main categories: The first is crises in the surrounding area and military security crises between China and foreign countries caused by military conflicts and wars in China’s surroundings. The second is crises caused by disputes over territory and maritime rights and interests between China and foreign countries. The third is the crises caused by the Taiwan issue. Since the end of the Cold War, and especially since the beginning of the 21st century, all three types of crises have undergone profound changes."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","First, on the global scale, military conflicts or local wars caused by traditional security issues and geopolitics (especially great power geopolitics) have been on the decline, and there has been a gradual decrease in military security crises resulting from these conflicts. However, security crises and military conflicts caused by non-traditional security issues are on the rise. This change has a profound impact. Compared with traditional security crises, in most non-traditional security crises, although there are still various differences in interests and fierce gamesmanship, the international community, including major powers, has greater room for maneuvering in crisis management and a stronger tendency to seek cooperation because countries often have greater common interests."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","Second, some disputes over territorial and maritime rights and interests that previously led to military conflicts between Chinese and foreign countries have either been completely resolved or maintained in a basically stable state so that no new military conflicts have been triggered. Compared with territorial disputes on land, disputes over territorial waters and maritime rights and interests between China and some other countries have fluctuated in recent years. These disputes show a gradual trend towards greater tensions, but they are generally still under control. The general improvement in and development of political, economic, and security relations between the disputant countries, the existence of various dialogue and negotiation mechanisms, the establishment and strengthening of military security confidence-building measures, and the gradual acceptance of the idea of “putting aside disputes and pursuing joint development” (搁置争议，共同开发) by the parties to disputes62 are all important reasons for this situation."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","Third, after renewed outbreaks of crises and constant tensions, the situation in the Taiwan Strait has seen a major turning point in recent years, and we can see prospects for continued easing of tensions, improvement, and development in cross-strait relations. Although there is still a long way to go to completely resolve the Taiwan issue, because China has made the peaceful reunification of the two sides its unwavering goal, and China’s comprehensive national strength will continue to increase rapidly for a long time in the future, this coupled with the changes in the balance of political power within the island of Taiwan has caused the probability of a recurrence of another Taiwan Strait crises to drop significantly."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","Under this new situation, further strengthening the management of international military security crises and striving to combine this approach with conflict resolution and opportunity management should become the direction of China’s future efforts. These three changes are closely connected and are of great significance for better safeguarding national security and promoting peace and development in the region and the world."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","Crisis management (including crisis avoidance and crisis control) is a process in which the two sides in the crisis practice both gamesmanship and cooperation. The main goal is to try to protect one’s own interests while attempting to prevent conflicts of interest from escalating and turning into military conflicts and wars. Even in response to those major or serious conflicts of interest that cannot be eliminated for a long time in the future, such as land and maritime territorial disputes between China and foreign countries and maritime security frictions between China and the United States, some traditional security crises that still exist in China’s surroundings (such as the traditional conflict between India and Pakistan, the north-south confrontation on the Korean Peninsula, and the hostility between North Korea and the United States), and certain non-traditional security crises that are increasing in importance (such as crisis events and crisis situations that may be triggered by nuclear proliferation or international terrorism), crisis management should still be the primary and most important approach and method. In order to deal with these crises more effectively, in addition to continuously strengthening its own crisis management mechanisms, China should make greater efforts to establish bilateral and multilateral crisis management mechanisms with relevant countries."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","Conflict resolution means we must go beyond the temporary suppression of the crisis to completely eliminate the root cause of the conflict, allowing the parties to the conflict to rebuild their relationship with each other so that their goals are no longer in conflict with each other, or making all parties aware that their goals can be achieved without conflict.63 This is a more difficult and time-consuming task, but if it is achieved, it will have greater significance for peace and security. For some disputes over maritime rights and interests between China and foreign countries and concerning the differences that still exist between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, conflict resolution should be the focus of China’s future efforts. In addition, China should also redouble its efforts to move toward conflict resolution once some multilateral crisis management has achieved significant results.64"
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","Opportunity management requires the relevant countries and parties to transcend their differences in interests to seize all opportunities and conditions, cooperate as much as possible, and strive to attain the best possible outlook in security fields or issues where they share overlapping interests. To this end, we must completely abandon the Cold War mentality, change all the mindsets that start from considering the worst-case scenario, and avoid missing important opportunities for cooperation on other issues due to the prominence of differences at the current time or with regard to a single issue, much less be quick to stop cooperation on major issues as a means to resolve differences. This effort plays an irreplaceable role in expanding common interests, increasing mutual trust, and restraining and resolving differences."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","Opportunity management is an inevitable necessity given the new international situation, new challenges, and new types of major power relations facing a China that is determined to follow the path of peaceful development. It should develop together with crisis management and conflict resolution, with each promoting the others, and become an increasingly prominent aspect of China’s foreign relations."
Research on China’s Behavior in International Military Security Crises,"World Economics and Politics , Zhang Tuosheng","Apr 14, 2011","In fact, in recent years, China has actively promoted the concept of “building a harmonious world”, worked hard to implement a foreign policy of peaceful development and mutual benefit, actively advocated a new security concept that reflects the concepts of comprehensive security, common security and cooperative security, proposed many new crisis management principles one after another, and put forward pragmatic solutions to specific disputes and various policies to address the non-traditional security challenges intensifying around the world. This has already pointed out the direction by which China can closely integrate crisis management, conflict resolution, and opportunity management. This effort should accompany the whole process of China’s peaceful development. Its successful realization will not only vigorously promote China’s own security and development, but also promote lasting peace, development, and prosperity for the world."
Reunification Has Entered an Irreversible Historical Process,"2022 Cross-Strait Relations Seminar 2022, Liu Jieyi","Aug 18, 2022","Liu Jieyi, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, delivered an online speech at the 2022 Cross-Strait Relations Seminar on August 17. He said that the general trend of history is moving forward, and the reunification of the motherland and national rejuvenation have entered an irreversible historical process. This will not be diverted by the will of some stubborn anti-China forces on the U.S. side, nor will it be swayed by the wishful thinking of the “Taiwan independence” separatist forces. When vice rises one foot, virtue rises ten. No matter how the “Taiwan independence” forces and external forces collude to cause trouble, it will not change the fact that Taiwan is an iron part of China, nor will it stop the historical trend of national reunification and national rejuvenation. It will only accelerate the thorough liquidation of the “Taiwan independence” separatist forces and the complete bankruptcy of external interfering forces. The more than 1.4 billion Chinese people are steadily advancing the process of national reunification with higher fighting spirit, stronger determination, and a firmer pace."

Reunification Has Entered an Irreversible Historical Process,"2022 Cross-Strait Relations Seminar 2022, Liu Jieyi","Aug 18, 2022","Dear Deputy Secretary Zhou Ji,"
Reunification Has Entered an Irreversible Historical Process,"2022 Cross-Strait Relations Seminar 2022, Liu Jieyi","Aug 18, 2022",Distinguished guests and friends:
Reunification Has Entered an Irreversible Historical Process,"2022 Cross-Strait Relations Seminar 2022, Liu Jieyi","Aug 18, 2022","It is a great pleasure to attend the 2022 Cross-Strait Relations Seminar by video. On behalf of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, I would like to extend my warm congratulations on the convening of the seminar and my sincere greetings to the experts, scholars, guests, and friends from both sides of the Taiwan Strait."
Reunification Has Entered an Irreversible Historical Process,"2022 Cross-Strait Relations Seminar 2022, Liu Jieyi","Aug 18, 2022","Not long ago, we held a symposium on the 30-year 1992 Consensus, took a series of actions to counter Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan and the “Taiwan independence” separatist activities on the island, released the white paper The Taiwan Question and China’s Reunification in the New Era, demonstrating continued strengthening of the general trend of opposing “independence” and promoting reunification, and firmly promote the confidence, determination, and strength of the reunification of the motherland. In the near future, we are primed to usher in the success of the 20th Party Congress. This grand meeting will surely promote the process of national reunification and national rejuvenation. In this context, the theme of this seminar is “grasping the general trend of history and seeking national rejuvenation,” which is of great practical significance."
Reunification Has Entered an Irreversible Historical Process,"2022 Cross-Strait Relations Seminar 2022, Liu Jieyi","Aug 18, 2022","Since the 18th Party Congress, socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era. The Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core will coordinate the overall strategy of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and the great changes in the world unseen in a century, grasp the changing times of cross-Strait relations, enrich and develop the theory of national reunification and policies on Taiwan, and form a new era for the Party to solve the Taiwan issue. The overall strategy provides the fundamental follow-up and action guide for Taiwan work in the new era. We must grasp the general trend, focus on the overall situation, and stand on righteousness. We must firmly grasp our leadership and initiative in cross-Strait relations and continue to strengthen the timing and momentum of the reunification of the motherland. We must lead the development of cross-Strait relations in the right direction and push forward the reunification process of the motherland."
Reunification Has Entered an Irreversible Historical Process,"2022 Cross-Strait Relations Seminar 2022, Liu Jieyi","Aug 18, 2022","Over the past decade, we have persisted in forging ahead and promoting historic breakthroughs in cross-Strait political exchanges. We have established a regular communication mechanism between the competent authorities of cross-Strait affairs on both sides, have conducted mutual visits between the heads of the two authorities, and have established a hotline. By achieving the first meeting between leaders of the two sides since 1949, we have elevated cross-Strait political interaction to a new level, opened a new chapter in the development of cross-Strait relations, and established a new milestone in the process of national reunification."
Reunification Has Entered an Irreversible Historical Process,"2022 Cross-Strait Relations Seminar 2022, Liu Jieyi","Aug 18, 2022","Over the past decade, we have adhered to the one-China principle and the 1992 Consensus. On this basis, we have strengthened exchanges with relevant parties in Taiwan, have held in-depth dialogues and exchanges, and have gathered joint forces to oppose “Taiwan independence” and maintain the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations. Important steps have been taken to promote dialogue and consultation from all walks of life on both sides of the Strait to discuss cross-Strait relations and the future of the nation and unite compatriots on both sides of the Strait to jointly march towards the reunification of the motherland and the majestic force of national rejuvenation."
Reunification Has Entered an Irreversible Historical Process,"2022 Cross-Strait Relations Seminar 2022, Liu Jieyi","Aug 18, 2022","Over the past decade, we have adhered to a people-centered development philosophy, benefiting and serving Taiwan compatriots as the people of the mainland. We have taken the lead in sharing development opportunities on the mainland with Taiwan compatriots and have gradually implemented equal treatment. A series of policies and measures to benefit Taiwan and its people have been introduced to continue to deepen the integrated development of the two sides of the Strait, and we will continue to promote the spiritual integration of compatriots. As more Taiwan compatriots have integrated into the mainland of the motherland for development, we have witnessed more and more vivid practices of the cross-Strait community with a shared future."
Reunification Has Entered an Irreversible Historical Process,"2022 Cross-Strait Relations Seminar 2022, Liu Jieyi","Aug 18, 2022","Over the past decade, we have effectively responded to the complex and severe changes in the situation across the Strait, as well as risks and challenges. We have resolutely cracked down on “Taiwan independence” separatist activities and severely punished “Taiwan independence” diehards in accordance with the law. We have resolutely opposed the interference of external forces, effectively counteracting the “Taiwan card” played by external forces, and have continued to consolidate the pattern in which the international community adheres to the one-China principle. The struggle against separatism and interference has achieved new results, and the general trend of opposing “independence” and promoting reunification has been further strengthened."
Reunification Has Entered an Irreversible Historical Process,"2022 Cross-Strait Relations Seminar 2022, Liu Jieyi","Aug 18, 2022","Over the past decade, we have adhered to the principle of “People on Both Sides of the Taiwan Strait Are All of the Same Family, Realizing the Chinese Dream Together” and have broadly united Taiwan compatriots. We have continued to hold the Straits Forum, Cross-Strait Entrepreneurs Summit, Join Hands Forum, Cross-Strait Youth Development Forum, and other activities. We have inspired Taiwan compatriots to be participants, contributors, and beneficiaries of national rejuvenation, giving them the sense of pride, glory, and happiness of being properly Chinese, enhancing their understanding and recognition of the leadership of the CCP and the significant advantages of the socialist system."
Reunification Has Entered an Irreversible Historical Process,"2022 Cross-Strait Relations Seminar 2022, Liu Jieyi","Aug 18, 2022","The work with Taiwan over the past decade is an integral component of the 10-year great change of the new era, and it is carried out on the basis of the historic achievements and changes in the cause of the Party and the country. I would like to say once again that the key factor that determines the direction of cross-Strait relations is the development and progress of the motherland."
Reunification Has Entered an Irreversible Historical Process,"2022 Cross-Strait Relations Seminar 2022, Liu Jieyi","Aug 18, 2022","Distinguished guests and friends, realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is the greatest dream of the Chinese nation since modern times. To achieve this, the CCP has united and led the sons and daughters of the Chinese people to make a long-term and unremitting struggle. The Chinese nation has ushered in a great leap from standing up and becoming rich to becoming strong, entering an irreversible historical process in the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Our foundation for reunification grows ever stronger, our conditions are becoming more and more sufficient, our capabilities are growing stronger, and we are more confident, more capable, and closer to realizing the complete reunification of the motherland than ever before. The Taiwan issue arose out of national weakness and chaos and will surely be resolved with the rejuvenation of the nation. The historical trend of complete reunification of the motherland is unstoppable and irrepressible. This is where our stamina and focus lie, as well as our confidence and determination."
Reunification Has Entered an Irreversible Historical Process,"2022 Cross-Strait Relations Seminar 2022, Liu Jieyi","Aug 18, 2022","In the face of the historical trend of national rejuvenation and reunification of the motherland, the majority of compatriots in Taiwan should seriously think about how to conform to the historical trend and join the historical process as well as how to prevent a very small number of people from standing against the historical trend and hindering the historical process. As for which path will be followed, that depends on the future of Taiwan and depends on the interests and well-being of Taiwan compatriots and the development of cross-Strait relations."
Reunification Has Entered an Irreversible Historical Process,"2022 Cross-Strait Relations Seminar 2022, Liu Jieyi","Aug 18, 2022","We are pleased to see that more and more Taiwan compatriots, especially Taiwanese youth, have come to realize that the future of Taiwan lies in the reunification of the motherland and the well-being of Taiwan compatriots lies in the rejuvenation of the nation. More and more have firmly issued the declaration that “I am a part of rejuvenation, and I am a part of reunification.” They have taken the promotion of the complete reunification of the motherland and the common rejuvenation of the nation as a supremely glorious cause. They consciously participate in the great process of national rejuvenation and the reunification of the motherland."
Reunification Has Entered an Irreversible Historical Process,"2022 Cross-Strait Relations Seminar 2022, Liu Jieyi","Aug 18, 2022","The white paper released a week ago thoroughly implements the CCP’s overall strategy for solving the Taiwan issue in the new era, comprehensively summarizes the struggle, major achievements, and valuable experience of the CCP in unswervingly advancing the complete reunification of the motherland, and profoundly exposes and criticizes the acts and fallacies of “Taiwan independence” separatism and interference by external forces. The white paper systematically clarifies the major policies and policy propositions for promoting the reunification of the motherland in the new era and for the new journey, clearly shows the historical trend of the reunification of the motherland, and fully indicates the bright future of peaceful reunification. We hope that the vast number of Taiwan compatriots will follow the general trend of history, see clearly where their future interests lie, stand on the right side of history, and work together for national rejuvenation and reunification of the motherland to create a bright future that belongs to them and the Chinese nation."
Reunification Has Entered an Irreversible Historical Process,"2022 Cross-Strait Relations Seminar 2022, Liu Jieyi","Aug 18, 2022","In the face of the general trend of history, there will always be certain countercurrents, turning back waves, and moving against the historical trend. Since the DPP authorities came to power, they have stubbornly adhered to the “Taiwan independence” separatist stance, refused to recognize the one-China principle and the 1992 Consensus, created cross-Strait confrontation, and attempted to “rely on the United States to seek independence” and “reject reunification by force” in an attempt to resist the motherland. They wantonly destroy the prospect of peaceful reunification and have squeezed the space for peaceful reunification. They betrayed national interests, colluded with external forces, acted as pawns, and have attempted to interfere with the historical process of national rejuvenation. The very small number of “Taiwan independence” separatist forces are obstacles that must be removed on the road to the reunification of the motherland. They are hidden dangers that must be eliminated in the process of national rejuvenation. We are willing to strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification with the greatest sincerity and utmost of efforts, but if “Taiwan independence” separatist forces continue to provoke and persecute us or even break through the red line, we will have to take decisive measures. We hope that the majority of Taiwan compatriots will act with justice and come forward to jointly eradicate the root cause of “Taiwan independence,” resolutely defeat the “Taiwan independence” attempt, and contribute wisdom and strength to the nation’s righteousness, vital interests, and bright future."
Reunification Has Entered an Irreversible Historical Process,"2022 Cross-Strait Relations Seminar 2022, Liu Jieyi","Aug 18, 2022","Some forces in the United States have stepped up their efforts to “contain China with Taiwan” in an attempt to use the “Taiwan card” to obstruct the process of China’s reunification and national rejuvenation. They have gone further and further down the wrong path, constantly hollowing out the one-China principle, elevating the level of official exchanges between the United States and Taiwan, increasing the military ties between the United States and Taiwan, constantly selling weapons to Taiwan, instigating “independence” provocations, and ganging up to interfere in China’s internal affairs in an attempt to promote the “internationalization of the Taiwan issue.” Half a month ago, Nancy Pelosi openly visited Taiwan and made unreasonable provocations against the more than 1.4 billion Chinese people. She was strongly opposed and countered by the Chinese government and its people. China’s solemn position has been unanimously supported by the majority of countries upholding justice in the international community. Whether external forces play the “Taiwan card” or “Taiwan independence” forces rely on external forces to seek “independence,” they can only end in failure."

Decades have passed, and the United States has not only failed to keep its political commitment to the Chinese government on the Taiwan issue but has reversed the course of history. The actions of the United States will only make it clear to the world that some forces in the United States are attempting to undermine China’s peaceful reunification process and the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait. The “Taiwan independence” separatist forces on the island colluding with external forces will inevitably push Taiwan into a dangerous situation and cause great harm to the Taiwan compatriots."

As a member of the Chinese nation, looking forward to the bright future of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, I hope that everyone will uphold the righteousness of the nation. I hope that we can guide Taiwan compatriots to see the general trend of history clearly, understand that reunification is beneficial, that “Taiwan independence” is a dead end, and that outsiders are unreliable so as to jointly create a bright future for national rejuvenation and the reunification of the motherland."

Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","The core goal of China’s security strategy is to provide a peaceful and stable international security environment for China’s reform and opening up. To create an ideal security environment, on the one hand, the international community needs to invest more time and energy to understand China. On the other hand, China also needs to more clarify what the ideal security environment it pursues is. Although we cannot expect that our unilateral efforts alone will make all countries friendly to us, we must make all efforts to remove the doubts of other countries that are unclear about China’s goals. This will make it easier for the international community to accept the arrival of an increasingly powerful China."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","In another article, the author explores what China’s ideal security environment should be.1 Here, the author will discuss China’s ideal security environment from the perspective of some strategic concepts and finally try to answer a core question: What kind of international status should China ultimately pursue (or, in other words, what kind of country does China want to become)? Although such discussions may not seem to be immediately connected to our actual policies, in fact, perceptions of these questions (especially the leaders’ perceptions of these questions) have a constant influence on China’s security policy. In this regard, a brief review of history is enough to lead to such a conclusion.2‎"
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001",I. Responsibilities and Status
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","As China’s international status has risen, the discussion on how China can be a “responsible power” is gradually deepening both in China and abroad.3 However, none of these discussions touches on the essence of the question, namely, how should China undertake responsibilities? Should we take the initiative to seek responsibilities, or should we wait until other countries ask China to undertake responsibilities? One popular opinion is that if China does not take the initiative to take responsibility, it will be considered too “selfish” or “too much of a realist” (太过现实主义, as in the realist school of international relations) by other countries. Therefore, China should take the initiative to undertake responsibilities."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","But in fact, in an anarchic international society, all states are “selfish” in the final analysis, and “selfishness” is not a matter of moral judgment in international relations. In the final analysis, if others consider China, as a state, to be “selfish,” this will not damage our reputation."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","From a historical point of view, the fate of those countries considered by other countries to be “selfish” is much better than the fate of countries considered by other countries to be eager to take on responsibilities and therefore eager to emerge as a great power—almost all of the latter were destroyed. This is because countries that take the initiative to take on responsibilities usually do so in order to make a show of taking on responsibility as a means to teach others. This creates antipathy on the part of other countries, especially when these countries do not have the ability to take on the responsibility and thus give the impression that they are “biting off more than they can chew.” This eagerness to take on responsibility will be regarded by other countries as a manifestation of ambition, and it often leads other countries to band together to “contain” the country that tries to take on responsibility. The most famous example of this was Germany before World War I. 4"
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","It is only when other countries require a country to assume certain responsibilities that the country taking on these responsibilities will more easily receive acceptance and support from other countries. The American presence in Europe after World War II is a classic example of this. Towards the end of World War II, Roosevelt told Churchill that the United States would withdraw from Europe within two years after the end of the war, leaving the UK and the Soviet Union with the responsibility for maintaining peace in Europe.5 The result was that both Britain and France, finding themselves unable to withstand pressure from the Soviet Union, had to actively request the United States to return to Europe. As a result, during the Cold War, even the proud French never asked the United States to withdraw from Europe."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","In sharp contrast, in the post-Cold War world of today, when Europe no longer faces external threats and therefore no longer needs the American umbrella, European countries are very dissatisfied with the fact that the United States is still interfering too much in European affairs (in other words, they think the United States has assumed many responsibilities that it should not have assumed). The birth of the European single currency and the emergence of the European Rapid Response Force are in fact a reflection of the fact that European countries no longer want the United States to always take on responsibilities that it should not take on with an arrogant attitude that this is its duty because there is no one else who can do it. The antipathy of the United States to this change in attitude on the part of the European countries is in fact because the United States is too eager to take on responsibility [而美国对欧洲国家这一态度转变的反感其实就是美国太想承担责任, I have given the literal translation, but I suspect the correct interpretation is “This change this the attitude of the European countries to one of antipathy towards the United States is in fact because the United States is too eager to take on responsibility”]."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","Therefore, in the process of China becoming a “responsible power,” China should only assume such responsibilities that earn it the support and acceptance of other countries. We should never take on responsibilities that are not ours to undertake for the sake of creating a “responsible” image, especially for the sake of face (面子, i.e., reputation). In fact, it is only by taking on responsibilities in a way that earns the support and acceptance of other countries that we can create a true image of a “responsible power.”"
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","Today’s China is still far from being a true great power, and the mentality of slapping one’s face to make one’s self look fat (打肿脸充胖子, puffing one’s self up) is extremely dangerous. This is because such a mentality is bound to have a subtle influence on the behavior of the state, bringing about a series of dangerous actions. Such actions do not even have to be aggressive military expansion, which will arouse the vigilance and antipathy of other countries."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","Japan’s performance after its economic take-off in the 1980s provides the most recent example that eagerness to take on responsibility comes at a price. At that time, Japan, which already felt that it was “the world’s No. 1 country,” began to talk about “internationalization” and began to go around teaching people how to do things. The appreciation of the yen after the Plaza Accord in 1985 led Japan into a mad rush to buy up some of the U.S.’s iconic cultural heritage. These actions not only made the American people angry, but also gave American elites and leaders a “worthy adversary” against which to formulate the U.S. Action Program."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","As a result, the United States adopted various industrial policies and a trend of learning from Japan. The United States began to see Japan more as an adversary than an ally (U.S. opinion polls shortly before and after the end of the Cold War indicated that Japan had replaced the Soviet Union as America’s No. 1 adversary). As a result, ten years later, when the dust of this war without weapons settled, Japan found that “Japan as the No. 1 country in the world” had always been a fantasy. When Japan woke up from its economic bubble, the Japanese may have asked themselves: How could we have believed that we could become the No. 1 country in the world?"
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","In a sense, China has fallen into the same trap today. After the World Bank released its widely disseminated East Asian Miracle report, coupled with the bubble mentality brought about by China’s overheated economy at that time, the mentality of many Chinese people was suddenly inflated. The talk one heard from Chinese elites during this period was almost identical in mentality and form to the talk of the Japanese before them: They began to talk about the rise and fall of hegemony (that is, the fall of the United States); talk about how many years it will take China to surpass Japan and then the United States; talk about how China will soon replace the United States; and talk about what sort of role model China should for developing countries, what kind of contributions China should make, and what kind of responsibilities it should take on."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","Chinese elites who hold these mentalities simply do not realize that, when it realizes that any country could catch up with the it even in the very distant future, the United States, as an extremely nationalistic country, will exaggerate the abilities or potential of that country as much as possible, making it an imaginary enemy so as to consolidate and focus the power of the United States. During the Cold War, American elites constantly exaggerated the strength of the Soviet Union, throwing out myths that the United States had fewer missiles than the USSR [i.e., the “Missile Gap”] and that the USSR’s GDP was already 70% of that of the United States. The same was true of the United States’ attitude to Japan in later years: The titles that swept the United States at that time were Japan as No. 1 and Rising Sun."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","Today, the United States is using the same formula for China. All of the ideas about China’s future trends originate in the United States or the West: “theories about China’s future as the No. 1 country” (disguised “China threat theory”), “Asian megatrends,” “Confucian cultural advantage theory,” “relative purchasing power theory,” “how the U.S. Navy will lose to the Chinese Navy in a future war,” and so on. Regrettably, when these sensational myths reach Chinese ears, they are accepted by Chinese elites who long ago lost their theoretical creativity and treasure every piece of garbage spewed by the West. They pass these themes back and forth with relish, hyping them up into big things to satisfy their vanity, which is a product of the serious inferiority complex arising from the nation’s century of humiliation. They have no idea that their lame boosterism is already viewed by the United States and Japan as evidence of China’s ambitions. Therefore, China has the “great honor” to become the new “worthy adversary” of the United States succeeding the Soviet Union and Japan.6 It can be said without hesitation that, despite the fact that China’s rapid development in the past two decades cannot be concealed, the behavior and mentality of Chinese elites in the second half of the 1990s clearly deepened other countries’ misgivings about Chinese intentions. This has done considerable harm."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","Our elites always like to use the quote about China attributed to Napoleon (“Let China Sleep, for when she wakes, she will shake the world”) to support their arguments, but this sentence is probably more apt for the United States. You can even add: After this lion wakes, be sure it does not notice you. Today, the predicament facing China is not that the United States does not view China as important, but that it attaches too great an importance to China. As the popular American saying goes: No news is good news."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","Japan, Germany, China, India, and other countries with failures in their history inevitably have a sense of urgency that they must quickly wash away or cover up this past with achievements (even if these are illusory), but this kind of psychology is extremely dangerous. If our citizens, elites, and leaders cannot let go of (or at least suppress) the mentality of serious inferiority due to the century of humiliation, China will have no hope of escaping the tragic cycle of history."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001",II. Integration and Shaping
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","One question linked to status and responsibility, and perhaps the hottest topic in discussions of China’s grand strategy over the past few years, has been: Is China going to integrate into the current U.S.-led world economic and political system, or is it going to challenge (or shape) this system. Here, the author will focus on two aspects of this question."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001",1.         Relationship Between Integration and Shaping
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","In the discussion about integration and shaping, there is no shortage of sharp insights from many scholars, but in general, these discussions consider integration and shaping to be two irreconcilable choices. In fact, however, when any system absorbs a new individual, the system itself changes (although these may be subtle changes that are imperceptible at first). At the same time, when an individual is integrated into a system, this simultaneously gives the individual the potential to change the system. Therefore, integration and shaping are never mutually exclusive. Rather, they are interconnected and mutually reinforcing. China’s reform and opening up is itself historical evidence that integration and shaping are interconnected and mutually reinforcing. Due to China’s integration into the world economic system, China’s comprehensive national strength has grown significantly in just 20 years. This has also greatly enhanced China’s ability to shape the world economic and political system. Today, China’s influence in international affairs is undoubtedly far greater than it was before the reform and opening up. While China is integrating its own economic system into the world economic system step by step by means such as the large-scale introduction of foreign capital and expansion of international trade, as an emerging international trade power and accumulator of foreign exchange reserves, China will have a profound and far-reaching impact on the world economic system. This effect will become more pronounced as the Renminbi becomes a freely convertible currency.7"
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","In the last 10 years, China’s active participation in some international organizations likewise proves the connection between integration and shaping.8 For example, when the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) was first established, one of its main purposes was to assimilate, incorporate, contain, and constrain China through engagement.9‎ Today, after China began actively participating in various activities of the ARF, it can be clearly seen that although ASEAN countries are still wary of China (in an anarchic international society, mutual defense between countries is “rational”, so this is understandable), it is obvious to all that their trust in China has been greatly strengthened and their attitude regarding the “China threat theory” has gradually changed."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001",2.         Possibility of Choice
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","If one looks at the question of integration from another perspective, we can conclude that China seems to have no choice but to continue the process of integration."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","First, in view of China’s current domestic social composition, China’s integration over the past two decades has created a powerful vested interest group with the majority of Chinese citizens composing the main body. Despite the widening gap between the rich and the poor at all levels of Chinese society, the material life that the majority of Chinese people enjoy today is obviously a great improvement compared to any period after the founding of New China. Most of the common people have become accustomed to a government that benefits the common people by continuously integrating into the international community while reforming the domestic political and economic system. In addition, although China has paid a huge price in the process of integrating into the world, objectively speaking, the beneficiaries of China’s so-called “globalization” process (the rise of China’s gross national product and total trade value on the global scale is obvious to all) [Translator’s note: This sentence is unclear in the source, but its meaning is probably “the common people of China are the beneficiaries of China’s so-called “globalization” process”]. It would be difficult for the government to convince its citizens that China will no longer be able to enjoy the benefits of this process in the future so it needs to change its policies. As a result, any attempt to cut off this integration process will encounter severe resistance and become basically unfeasible."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","Looking at the international environment, China obviously does not possess the external environment and ability to establish a political and economic system by itself. First, history has proved that a system based on coercive means is not only difficult to establish (not to mention that China does not have such coercive capabilities) but is also very unstable. Due to the centrifugal force within the system, the core countries of the system are forced to pay a high price in order to maintain the system, exhausting their national strength (colonial systems such as that of the UK and Eastern Europe under the control of the Soviet Union are the best examples). Therefore, to build a political and economic system, a country must possess a certain spiritual attraction, and China’s modern civilization obviously does not have such an attraction. Furthermore, to build a political and economic system, a country must possess a high degree of tangible influence. Such influence should at least include a sufficiently large economic scale, a sufficiently open market, a hard currency, and a sufficiently large capital reserve (for overseas investment). Obviously, China does not possess these conditions: The dependency of China’s current economy on the economies of other countries is greater than the dependency of these countries on China. In this sort of objective international environment, China’s influence on the international system is extremely limited, so it is also unable to establish its own system."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001",III. Sea Power and Land Power
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","The humiliation suffered at the hands of the gunboats of the great powers has long inspired China to become a maritime power. However, we must be soberly aware that military power is developed in order to achieve the country’s strategic goals, not to satisfy the dream of becoming a maritime power."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","Besides safeguarding national security, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, China’s most important strategic goal is to find a way to achieve reunification. Moreover, if we have no choice but to use military means to resolve the Taiwan issue, the most critical part is to deter possible U.S. intervention.10"
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","Both the Gulf War and the Kosovo War have clearly demonstrated that defensive forces, as traditionally understood, are now unable to counter the long-range attack force of precision-guided weapons. In a sense, like the advent of nuclear weapons, the perfection of precision-guided weapons signifies a further separation of deterrence and defense (especially in conventional warfare).11 Prior to this, even if one country did not have the ability to cause much damage to another country in an attack, it could still deter enemy aggression (or pressure) by fighting for every inch of territory on the battlefield (such as Finland’s strategy against the former Soviet Union). This strategy is deterrence by denial. In the era of precision-guided weapons, because the two sides do not actually come into contact on the battlefield, if the stronger side does not want to occupy the territory of the weaker country, the strategy of deterrence by denial will not be able to deter to the stronger side if its strategy is simply to force the other side into submission. Therefore, in the era of precision-guided weapons, if a country wants to deter similar wars, it must have the ability to make its opponents pay a sufficiently high price, that is, the ability to exercise deterrence by punishment."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","Although the deterrent force must be an offensive force, it is not a pure offensive force, but a retaliatory strike force. Like nuclear deterrence, conventional deterrence forces should be forces that are not easily destroyed and can strike the enemy. To achieve such deterrence, we must upgrade our military’s conventional deterrence with respect to the United States from its current defensive deterrence to truly meaningful deterrence, that is, deterrence based on retaliatory strike power. The point of deterrence is not to protect ourselves from harm, but to ensure that the losses to the other party are unbearable to it."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","The U.S. military’s intervention force in the Far East consists of four pillars: forward garrisons, fast maneuvering aircraft carrier battle groups, comprehensive battlefield information (mainly including satellite, airborne early warning, and listening), and long-range strike forces (including stealth strike forces). With respect to the long-range strike forces of the United States, we likely will not possess effective countermeasures for quite some time in the future. However, to form deterrence against the United States, we do not need the capability to strike all of its forces, but only the remaining three of its four pillars."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","The best deterrent weapons against the United States are stealth attack forces: stealth attack aircraft, nuclear attack submarines, and long-range cruise missiles. The effectiveness of stealth attack aircraft as a deterrent weapon is self-evident. Nuclear attack submarines with good stealth capabilities are also excellent deterrent weapons. Nuclear attack submarines can threaten the U.S. aircraft carrier fleet and constitute a powerful deterrent in themselves. Nuclear attack submarines can also carry long-range cruise missiles to attack U.S. ground forces in the Far East, constituting a strike force against the forward garrisons of the United States. These undersea attack forces can inflict heavy losses on the U.S. military even after the U.S. has destroyed our equivalent ground-based missile force. At the same time, nuclear attack submarines can become an effective force for blockading Taiwan. Therefore, nuclear submarines with stealth capabilities are an excellent weapon to strengthen our ability to solve the Taiwan issue: They can be used to deter U.S. intervention and can also be used to force Taiwan to make concessions."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","Information attack capabilities are a second weapon of deterrence against the United States. The U.S. military is already heavily reliant on battlefield information superiority. This also means that if we can prevent or interfere with the opponent’s ability to gain battlefield information advantages (such as satellite blocking capabilities and listening interference capabilities), this would greatly increase the risks to U.S. military action in the Far East, thereby helping to deter U.S. military intervention."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","The discussion above shows that, in order to deter the United States from intervening in the Taiwan Strait crisis, China does not need to develop a navy that can compete with the United States for dominance of the sea. At this point, missiles, air forces, an underwater navy, and an effective nuclear deterrent would suffice to achieve the above goal. In addition, these forces would be far more effective than an expensive surface navy."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","More importantly, if we carefully examine the maritime environment facing our country, we can conclude that: It is almost impossible for China to become a true maritime power. In the vast Pacific Ocean, China does not control any island that could serve as a naval supply base. Even if Taiwan returns to the motherland and even if we persuade a reunified Korean peninsula to become a neutral country, this will still only open two small gaps in the chain of offshore islands around China. Moreover, even if the United States loses Taiwan and the Korean peninsula, it will still have the two iron chains of Japan and the Philippines (and possibly even Singapore and Vietnam), limiting the freedom of movement of the Chinese navy. Looking a step further, the U.S. military presence in Australia and New Zealand will form a second line of defense against our navy, and bases controlled by the United States itself, such as Guam, will form the third line of defense against our navy. Without supply bases at sea, it is impossible for China to compete with the U.S. Navy for “rule of the waves.”"
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","Because the United States will likely think that we mean to challenge its maritime supremacy, the single-minded pursuit of a blue-sea navy will only bring us burdens or even disasters. For example, if we build aircraft carriers so that we can take pride in possessing an aircraft carrier, we risk making the same mistakes that Germany made before World War I: The massive fleet built by Germany could not itself compete with the British Navy, but it indirectly led to the defeat of Germany. This is because, based on Germany’s construction of this massive fleet, the UK concluded that Germany was not content with dominance on the European continent, but also wanted to challenge the UK’s maritime dominance.12‎ We must not make the same mistake."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","Of equal importance is the fact that Asian countries will be uneasy about China’s ambitions in competing with the United States for maritime supremacy. Because a China that controls the sea will be able to threaten other Asian countries at any time, the majority of Asian countries will choose to ally with the distant United States to balance it against neighboring China.‎13"
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","In contrast, China’s focus on developing a deterrent military force can alleviate the already tense “security dilemma” between China and the United States as far as possible, without sacrificing national interests. Because the deterrent military force does not seek to project power, but only to prevent the United States from intervening in affairs within the scope of China’s sovereignty, although the United States will still not welcome this development, it will respond better than if we were to try to become a maritime power."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","As a composite land–sea country, China has always faced “twice the difficulties in strategy and double the vulnerability in security” (战略上的两难和安全上的双重易受伤害性).14 Therefore, China has never been able to devote too much of its resources to developing sea power (the navy is much more expensive than the army). Unfortunately, some people’s worship of Mahan’s theory of sea power has almost brought them to the point of paranoia.15 These people ignored the fact that Mahan’s theory of sea power was actually written to influence the security strategy of the United States at that time,16‎ and is not necessarily applicable to a country like China, where land power is preeminent. Historically, some countries that believed in the theory of sea power did not “determine history” as Mahan claimed. Athens, the sea power of ancient Greece, did not win its war with Sparta. Kaiser Wilhelm, who had a fanatical admiration for the theory of sea power and claimed to be a devout follower of Mahan, brought only tragedy to Germany in the First World War. The fanaticism of Japanese militarists in Asia for the theory of sea power brought catastrophe to Asia and ultimately led to the destruction of Japan in World War II. In their praise of the theory of sea power on the basis of geopolitical concepts, many of our scholars have forgotten to review their history when they praised the theory of sea power based on geopolitical concepts. They need to remember the catastrophes that geopolitical blind faith has brought to Europe, Asia, and humanity as a whole, over the past century."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","Finally, it should be emphasized that the reason for abandoning the goal of becoming a maritime military power is not to abandon maritime development, but to do what is within our capabilities. Military power must be compatible with the overall interests of the country."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001",IV. Scope of Influence
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","Although the diversification of roles in the international community has reduced the ability of states to control international affairs, it cannot be denied that the stability and security of the world will still depend on power politics under the leadership of major powers. If the relationship between some major global powers, it will be difficult to maintain the peace of the international community. Conversely, if the major powers can reach a certain tacit strategic understanding or even an agreement and respect each other’s interests, it will be conducive to global peace and stability."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","Doubters and critics of geopolitical doctrine (including this author) have made the concept of a sphere of influence an unpopular one. In fact, there is no causal relationship between spheres of influence themselves and geopolitical theory: Geopolitical theory is a theory, which can be right or wrong. A sphere of influence refers to the influence of a country on its region and surrounding countries and affairs. Such spheres are only divided into large and small, not right or wrong. Whether we like the concept of spheres of influence or use other concepts to describe this influence, a country’s influence on neighboring countries and affairs will still actually exist. Spheres of influence themselves are not evil things as many believe, nor are they intrinsically linked to hegemony."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","Historically, many important countries have had different sizes and scopes of influence on the affairs of neighboring countries, but this influence is not entirely the result of conquest by force.17 More often, the formation and size of this influence are determined by the weight of a country’s power in the minds of other countries around it. The perceptions of a country’s power by other countries around it can affect how those countries behave. If these countries behave in a way that shows respect for the first country’s interests, a sphere of influence is formed. Therefore, in a sense, the formation of spheres of influence does not necessarily result from the deliberate efforts of great powers."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","In many cases, the interests of great powers are measured by their spheres of influence. Therefore, to a large extent, respect for a sphere of influence also reflects the respect for the strength and status of a country. When major powers can respect each other’s spheres of influence, they can achieve a tacit strategic understanding. Moreover, when one great power challenges the sphere of influence of another, conflict often ensues. During the Cold War, peace between the United States and the Soviet Union was heavily reliant on the two superpowers respecting each other’s spheres of influence. If one side challenges the backyard of the other, a crisis ensues: To a large extent, the Cuban Missile Crisis was a challenge to the United State’s traditional sphere of influence."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","Therefore, in the history of international relations, great powers have not been shy about emphasizing their spheres of influence. For example, although the United States denies that it seeks its own sphere of influence in most situations, one of its earliest diplomatic doctrines, the “Monroe Doctrine,” was a doctrine that defined a sphere of influence. Since then, its actions in Central and South America are irrefutable proof that the United States still pursues this doctrine. Similarly, both the former Soviet Union and today’s Russia have emphasized the importance of their sphere of influence to their national security interests. India’s control of South Asia is likewise based on an understanding of spheres of influence."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","Along this line, a major issue facing an increasingly powerful China is how to define its sphere of influence, respect the spheres of influence of other great powers, and establish compromise mechanisms in areas with potential conflicts of interest (usually at the intersections of spheres of influence) to prevent and resolve conflicts. In fact, the answers to these questions have defined China’s ideal security environment and security strategy to a considerable extent, and are closely linked to the issues discussed above."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","The difficulty of this topic also comes from a problem located at a deeper level: China’s century of humiliation caused China’s sphere of influence from its imperial age to cease to exist, so in a China with growing national power and growing nationalism, many people find it hard to accept the fact that they cannot restore their former glory. Therefore, on the issue of defining spheres of influence, China’s leaders face the daunting task of educating the people and making difficult choices."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","One possible way is to gradually make people aware of the pros and cons of various options by defining our own spheres of influence, while simultaneously cooperating with actions that respect the spheres of influence of other countries to convey such a message to other countries. That is, China does not pursue expansion or wish to conquer neighboring countries. China hopes to maintain world and regional peace and stability by reaching a strategic understanding among major powers."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","Looking at the four major powers surrounding China (Russia, Japan, the United States, and India), we will see that, at the moment, it is difficult for China to reach a strategic understanding because of the extremely realistic possibility of conflict with the United States (and perhaps Japan) over the Taiwan issue. With Russia, Japan, and India, despite the unavoidable reality of having different interests, it is entirely possible to establish compromise mechanisms to prevent and resolve conflicts in areas of potential conflict of interest (usually at the intersections of spheres of influence). At the very least, this can reduce the likelihood of an armed conflict breaking out to an extremely low level.18"
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","China’s strategy of not developing naval power that can challenge the maritime supremacy of the United States, which we proposed earlier, is in fact a demonstration of our respect for the sphere of influence of this United States. It’s just that, here, the sphere of influence is the vast Pacific Ocean. The United States is not shy about the fact that the Pacific Ocean is its sphere of influence. Most American scholars have long believed that the Pacific Ocean will be an “American Lake” for a long time. Some American scholars have already realized that, even if the United States were to allow the reunification of China and neutralization of the Korean peninsula, it would not pose much of a threat to the U.S. position in Asia. In this way, China’s choice not to challenge U.S. supremacy at sea will leave some room for China and the U.S. to reach some sort of strategic understanding: A Sino-U.S. relationship that is governed by making the ocean a dividing line between them (划洋而治) is in the interests of China and the United States."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","However, we must be soberly aware that the test as to whether China and the United States can reach a real strategic compromise will still be the Taiwan issue: If the United States remains unwilling to publicly express its support for the arrival of a unified, open, democratic, and strong China even after China has expressed respect for the U.S. sphere of influence, then a war between China and the United States is probably inevitable unless the Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait can use their wisdom and patience to finally achieve the great cause of the reunification of the Chinese nation."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","To date, most elites in the United States have not accepted that the reunification of Taiwan is a legitimate interest of China. Instead, they believe that the reunification of Taiwan will be the beginning of China’s challenge to the U.S. position in the Asia-Pacific region. If this state of affairs continues, not only will it be difficult for the Sino-U.S. relationship to avoid brinkmanship, but it may eventually spiral out of the control of the leaders of both countries. This is because, with the increasingly open and democratized society in mainland China, the people in the mainland increasingly feel that there is more ample reason to demand Taiwan’s reunification and, in the face of such strong public pressure, it is almost impossible for mainland leaders to fail to meet the demands of this sort of popular will. Therefore, American elites must realize that the consequences of the democratization of China will be manifold. Moreover, American elites must prepare the American people for the consequences of China’s democratization."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","If the United States fails to respect China’s interests, the relationship between the United States and a reunified China will remain volatile. Therefore, despite the many uncertainties in today’s Sino-U.S. relations, the leaders and elites of China and the United States have faced this issue with great wisdom. However, in the long run, the greatest challenge for the leaders and elites in the two countries is how to convince American elites and the masses to accept the advent of a unified China.19"
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001",V. What Kind of Great Power
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","After answering the above series of questions, it is finally possible to answer this type of question, namely: What kind of international status should China pursue (or, in other words, what kind of country does China want to become)?"
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","First, we can be certain that, in the era of globalization of the world economy, if a country is to be strong, it must be a global economic force. Therefore, China’s goal of becoming a global economic power is obvious."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","Second, because China’s geographical location and strategic needs determine that China cannot become a maritime military power, China should only seek to become a regional military power (rather than a global military power). Therefore, as one of the pillars of regional security, China will be able to work with other countries to maintain regional peace and stability through bilateral and multilateral security cooperation."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","Finally, because political status is based on economic and military power, as well as a country’s determination and ability to take on political responsibilities and risks, the political status that China should seek should be “a global political voice, but not a global political force.” As a global economic power, China’s economic interests will extend to regions all over the world. For a China that is unwilling to use military means to safeguard these economic interests, it must use its political influence to safeguard its economic interests. This political influence may come from China’s standing in various international organizations (such as the United Nations and IMF) and historical relations with developing countries. In addition, China needs to strive to expand its strategic partnerships with regional powers around the world."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","In summary, the international status that China should seek is to have its own global economic interests, to have a pivotal position in regional security affairs, and to have a political voice in global affairs."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","In connection with the issues of responsibility and status discussed earlier, it is reasonable to think that China’s development over the next 50 years will go through two stages."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","In the first stage, on the basis of the achievements made in the past reform and opening up, China will become a global economic entity (经济实体) in about 30 years.20 Over the next 30 years, China should further emancipate the mind and unleash innovation in the fields of institutions, thought, scientific research, and technological development in order to cultivate the most important core competency for the sustainable development of the country: the ability of the country to continuously learn as an organization of individuals.21‎ At the same time, China will participate more extensively in international organizations and communities and prudently assume the responsibilities that the international community entrusts to it (these responsibilities must be in the interests of the majority of countries, including China). On regional security issues, China will gradually build a national defense force on the basis of sufficient deterrence and defense capabilities and work with other countries to maintain regional stability and peace. On the basis of its increasingly extensive participation and undertaking of its due responsibilities, China will gradually construct its political influence in Asia-Pacific and adjacent regions."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","In the two decades of the second stage, China will become a truly global economic power. This should not only be reflected in China’s gross national product, but even more so in China’s possession of an important voice in the organizations that affect the world economic structure and order, like other important countries. In this stage, China will earn the world’s recognition and respect by taking on the responsibilities entrusted to China by the international community (which of course means paying a price) and thereby gaining a political voice to influence global affairs. However, China will always be cautious in the exercise of its political influence. China will also complete the establishment of an open civil society. China will not only complete the revival of civilization, but also complete the shaping of a new civilization on the basis of this revival: China’s political voice and influence will have a solid foundation only when our new civilization has a certain attractiveness to other countries in the world."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","It is worth pointing out that China’s political influence on global affairs will arise more from the relationships China has with developing countries. This is because, in developed countries, we cannot replace the influence of the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, and France. Therefore, strengthening China’s political influence in world affairs can only come from developing more comprehensive partnerships between China and developing countries. To this end, China should strengthen its relations with major developing countries, especially developing countries that are regional powers (such countries should at least include: Brazil, Argentina, South Africa, Egypt, Iran, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Indonesia, and India). Strengthening relations with major developing countries would be mutually beneficial to China and the developing countries: Only these major developing countries can have a common voice in global affairs and only these developing countries can effectively safeguard their interests in the world structure dominated by developed countries and seek the benefit of the many of developing countries. Otherwise, developing countries will be further marginalized in global affairs."
Revisiting China’s Grand Strategy,"Strategy and Management , Tang Shiping","Aug 5, 2001","Although it is difficult for China to change its overreliance on developed countries in a short period of time, over the long run, whether in terms of the market required for China’s economic development or the destination of future Chinese foreign investment, developing countries will become increasingly important to China. Unfortunately, the status of developing countries in current Chinese diplomacy is an unknown. Therefore, China should form a long-term policy with respect to developing countries as soon as possible. Of course, developing relationships with these developing countries does not mean we cannot maintain good relations with developed countries, nor should this involve too much ideological coloring."

It requires both the support of the country’s citizens and a sound external environment. After President Vladimir Putin came into power, he launched a series of domestic and foreign strategies, hoping to achieve these ambitious goals and restore Russia’s status as a great power. Although Russia’s national strength has recovered significantly with the help of its resource advantages, due to the decade of impact following the international financial crisis and the Crimea crisis, Russia’s economic development has been sluggish, and social divisions have become increasingly serious. and the United States and Europe have continued to strengthen economic and diplomatic sanctions against Russia to weaken the country’s international influence. Against the background of the COVID-19 pandemic, drastic changes in the international landscape have created opportunities for Russia’s comprehensive revitalization but have also brought about unprecedented and severe challenges."

The economy nearly collapsed, and the political situation was turbulent. When Putin became president in 2000, Russia was going through a very difficult historical period. Putin had a clear understanding of this: “For the first time in the past 200 to 300 years, Russia faces the real danger that it could be relegated to the second, or even the third tier of global powers.” From ordinary people to national elites, Russians began to long for the former glory of the Soviet Union and strongly hoped for national revitalization. Putin leaned into this appeal with confidence: “Russia was and will remain a great power. It is preconditioned by the inseparable characteristics of its geopolitical, economic and cultural existence.”1 Putin has made Russia a “great power on an equal footing with the United States” as his governing goal, which has been highly recognized by the people. The realization of Russia’s historic revival as a great power is regarded as the source of legitimacy for Putin’s long-term rule, and he has been in power steadily for more than 20 years."

"Russia’s Great Power Revival Strategy: Goals, Practices, and Challenges","Academic Journal of Russian Studies , Sun Zhuangzhi","Dec 10, 2021","If we examine Russia’s national revitalization in a cycle of about 10 years, then the first cycle is the period of Yeltsin’s reign (1991-1999). Due to the decision to expand the power of the Federal Assembly following the revision of the constitution, the Russian ruling authorities attached great importance to the election and made arrangements in advance to ensure that the political party United Russia could guarantee an absolute advantage in party elections and elections for single-seat constituencies, thus continuing to hold an absolute majority in the parliament. With this majority, they would be able to provide legislative support for Putin to formulate policies and introduce strategies, facing no obstacles in the appointment of important positions. In this way, they would guarantee the swift implementation of Putin’s orders, safeguard national sovereignty, and ensure social stability with a “strong” regime, providing a solid political guarantee for the implementation of Putin’s major policies and the strategic national revitalization. Although Yeltsin adjusted his diplomatic strategy after suffering international setbacks, implemented a “double-headed eagle” policy that took into account the East and the West, and established a strategic partnership of coordination with China in 1996, the economic transformation progressed slowly and economic development was stagnant for a long time."
"Russia’s Great Power Revival Strategy: Goals, Practices, and Challenges","Academic Journal of Russian Studies , Sun Zhuangzhi","Dec 10, 2021","The second cycle spanned a longer period, including the eight years when Putin was first president and the four years when Medvedev was president and Putin was prime minister. At this stage, Russia seemed to be very close to Putin’s goal. The ruling authorities first strengthened the control of the central government over the localities, solved the Chechen problem that had plagued Russia’s national unity and security for many years, and then ruled out the threat to the regime from the oligarchs. Diplomatically, Russia got along well with Europe, and the relationship between Russia and the United States was rekindled. Even the “Five-Day War” with Georgia over South Ossetia in 2008 did not affect the relationship with the United States and Europe, receiving active mediation from France and Germany. Due to high energy prices, the economy has maintained high growth for several consecutive years, and the country’s wealth has increased rapidly, but it has also caused the economy to be highly dependent on energy, solidifying an untenable economic structure. After the outbreak of the global financial crisis, the Russian economy was hit hard, and it spread to other CIS countries."
"Russia’s Great Power Revival Strategy: Goals, Practices, and Challenges","Academic Journal of Russian Studies , Sun Zhuangzhi","Dec 10, 2021","The third cycle ran from 2012 to 2021. Putin once again took over power from Medvedev, who had been in power for four years, despite opposition from the West, and soon encountered the crisis in Ukraine. The geopolitical confrontation with the West has led to severe economic sanctions from the United States and Europe, but Russia still maintains a strong aggressiveness in diplomacy, sending troops to Syria and putting forward the “Turn to the East” and “Greater Eurasian Partnership” plans. Russia has not been defeated by Western sanctions and remains strong on the international stage, though economic difficulties have hindered Putin’s dream of becoming a great power. The rapid deterioration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the international environment, coupled with the tremendous pressure of domestic social division, has forced Putin to change his strategic plan. The revival of Russia’s great power has also entered a new period of adjustment."

Since then, however, growth has remained stagnant. As the economy relies upon energy and raw materials, it is also often affected by price fluctuations in the international market. If you only look at economic performance, it seems difficult for Russia to maintain its original status. However, in terms of land area, resource endowment, and technological potential, it is hard to compare Russia to other countries. Russia’s military strength, in particular, still strikes fear in the United States. In fact, Putin’s national revitalization strategy reflects Russia’s real national interests to a considerable extent, and the country has begun to restore its self-confidence as a great power, which has been widely recognized by domestic elites and ordinary people alike. After Crimea returned to Russia in 2014, Putin’s approval rating in the polls soared rapidly, reaching as high as 89%, indicating that Putin’s strongman politics has a high degree of trust, known as the “Crimea Consensus.”"

During Putin’s first term, energy prices in the international market brought rapid growth to the Russian economy, the country increased its investment in society, and people’s living standards were instantly and significantly improved. But affected by the financial crisis, Russia’s economy fell into a slump again, so Putin issued a broad plan to revive the society and economy after returning to the Kremlin in May 2012, known as the “May Orders.” The ambitious plan included 11 elements, covering social policy, improving health care and education systems, and addressing housing supply and the quality of community services. In Putin’s view, relying on strong state control and huge resource advantages, Russia could soon become a global economic power, and even at first, experts thought that the estimates were too conservative (if the annual GDP growth rate is not less than 8%, it could reach the level of Portugal or Spain in 15 years; if a growth rate of 10% is maintained, it can reach the level of the United Kingdom or France in 15 years). He believed that “we are not that far behind these countries, we can catch up faster.”2 Putin personally grasped the implementation of the “May Orders” and convened various government departments many times to listen to reports on the implementation of the orders. Many ministers were “rebuked” by the president for their poor implementation.3 There are many reasons for the failure of the “May Orders” to be completed on time, and the Western sanctions and withdrawal of capital after the Ukraine crisis is undoubtedly an important reason."
"Russia’s Great Power Revival Strategy: Goals, Practices, and Challenges","Academic Journal of Russian Studies , Sun Zhuangzhi","Dec 10, 2021","On May 7, 2018, Putin, beginning his fourth presidential term, signed a new order, known as the “New May Orders,” planning the strategic development tasks and goals of the Russian Federation before 2024 and specifically setting forth the economic goals of the revitalization to a great power, with special emphasis placed on the solution of social problems. The main contents include: The government should reduce the country’s poor population by half, ensure the stable growth of residents’ income, and increase the rate of retirement pensions to be higher than the rate of inflation. Raise the average life expectancy of the Russian population to 78 years and build or renovate housing to meet the needs of 5 million households every year. To enter the top five economies in the world by 2024, Russia must ensure that Russia’s GDP growth is higher than the global average every year, and the inflation rate does not exceed 4%. 4 The orders not only included indicators of people’s livelihood but also included “heavy blows” such as environmental governance and economic structure adjustments."

It could be seen that Putin had begun to recognize the harsh reality and believed that it was more important to consolidate political and social stability through economic development. For example, in his many speeches in 2021, he paid special attention to the issue of ensuring employment and proposed that as the current unemployment rate in Russia was about 5%, it should be reduced to 4.6% from 2022 to 2024, reflecting that the plan he formulated was more pragmatic."

The first is to recognize that Russia is no longer a country that represents the highest level of economic and social development in the contemporary world, and the country faces the real danger of becoming a second- or third-rate country. The second is to take the interests of the country and the nation as the foothold and starting point of all policies and policies. To this end, it is necessary to carry forward Russian ideology and values, including, as a great power, the consciousness of a strong country, the role of the state, and social solidarity. The third is that domestic goals are more important than foreign goals, and that Russia’s position in the world depends on whether domestic problems can be solved smoothly. The fourth is to establish a development model suitable for Russia’s national conditions rather than blindly following the West, as Russia cannot become a copy of the United States or the United Kingdom. Fifth, Russia’s foreign policy must be linked to its security strategy, combining domestic security, peripheral security and international security. By revising security strategies and military doctrines, Russia will drive adjustments to foreign policy, enhance the potential of nuclear deterrence, defend national sovereignty, safeguard national dignity, consolidate its status as a great power, demand the establishment of international relations in line with Russia’s national interests, and undertake international obligations commensurate with its national strength.

In Russia’s view, the increasing importance of military power as a tool for countries to achieve their own geopolitical goals reflects that in the absence of economic backing, the country can only return to traditional means. Lukyanov, editor-in-chief of Russia in Global Affairs, pointed out in an article on Russia’s foreign policy in 2020 that military power has once again become the main tool of foreign policy, and international mechanisms have taken a back seat. 6 In this sense, Russia is still a global power and one of the important “players” and power centers in the existing international structure."

Historically, Russia, even when it was most prosperous, had obvious economic and social “shortcomings,” and it relied more on strong military strength and pragmatic diplomacy to become one of the great powers. Whether it was participating in the fanatical geopolitical Great Game as one of the European powers of the 19th century or the bipolar confrontation with the United States in the Soviet era, Russia has successfully increased its influence in the region and the world, seeking or safeguarding its own strategic interests. As a very realistic leader with “great power sentiment,” Putin, on the one hand, recognizes the complex changes in the post-Cold War world and frankly admits the decline of Russia’s national strength; on the other hand, he firmly believes that Russia has the necessary ability and conditions to return to the ranks of the global powers."

Those in power realized that, on the one hand, they are getting closer to “maintaining” or “losing” the country’s strength, and on the other hand, they also saw that Russia’s political and economic process is encountering new difficulties. The sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union on Russia are still ongoing, and they grow tougher with each new round. Since Biden took office, the hostile policies of the United States and Europe to Russia have continued unabated. There have been constant crises and turmoil around Russia, and the external environment has further deteriorated. Putin’s hopes of improving relations with the West or dividing the United States and Europe are even more difficult to achieve. Strong foreign policy is an important part of Russia’s national revitalization strategy, but it is difficult to display it calmly under the new state of affairs. Having suffered frequent blows in handling relations with the United States and Europe, Russia has to pay more attention to cooperation with “non-Western” powers such as China and India. At the same time, in the face of increasingly severe internal and external challenges, it is extremely difficult to achieve the goal of economic “catch-up” in a short period of time through rapid growth."

The “New May Orders” suffered a major blow. According to Russian scholars, there are many problems in the Russian economy, and the potential to increase welfare only by relying on hydrocarbon resources has been exhausted. The most acute problem is the devaluation of the ruble, with a price increase of 600% in 20 years; the proportion of investment in GDP is significantly behind. In the past 10 years, the Russian economy has grown by only 9%, with an average annual growth rate of less than 0.9%. In the same period, the average annual growth rate of the world economy is about 3%. There is a saying of a “lost decade.” The birth rate has continued to fall, and a population crisis has broken out. 7 In 2019, the poverty rate in Russia was 10.9%. The Russian government plans to reduce it to 6.5% by 2030, but the annual growth rate of residents’ real income is only about 3%, and the inflation rate is as high as 5%. 8 If you only look at economic indicators, Russia has even been left behind by South Korea and Turkey in recent years, accounting for less than 2% of the world economy. Since 2014, the actual income of the Russian people has been declining year after year, which has caused dissatisfaction in the society. In particular, there were large-scale demonstrations in response to the unfair distribution of wealth and government corruption. Navalny, a representative of the opposition, took advantage of public dissatisfaction and mobilized through the internet to repeatedly set off waves of opposition to Putin and his ruling party."

In 2020, Russia’s GDP was 106.6 trillion rubles at current prices, a year-on-year decrease of 3.1%; the GDP converted at the annual average exchange rate was about 1.474 trillion U.S. dollars, and the world ranking fell to 11th; per capita GDP is about 728,000 rubles, equivalent to only 10,100 in U.S. dollars (it was close to 16,000 U.S. dollars in 2013). Putin, however, still has confidence in long-term economic development. At the economic meeting held on September 21, 2021, he emphasized that Russia’s annual GDP growth can be stabilized at 4.2%, and industrial growth from January to July will reach 4.4%, sparking a return in investor confidence.

Although he does not face many political challenges, with Putin still maintaining a high approval rate, the prolonged epidemic and crisis have not only made economic recovery weak, but also the problems of social security and even national sovereignty have become more prominent. At the same time, it is unrealistic to rely on cooperation with Asian countries to achieve balanced development of the regional economy. Although Russia straddles Eurasia geographically, it is closer to Europe in culture, and the elites have even long been “disdainful” of Asian culture and distrust Asian countries in terms of politics and security.

In the early days of his administration, Putin actively improved relations with the West. He formally joined the G7 in 2002 and hosted the G8 summit in 2006. Putin soon realized that the Western countries were more concerned with exchanging financial assistance for Russia to destroy nuclear weapons and that the West could not truly “accept” Russia. As the confrontation between the two sides escalated over the Ukraine issue, Russia was “kicked” out of the Western “club of great powers,” and the G7 resumed in 2014.

Belarus, Armenia, and Kyrgyzstan are all members of the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union and the Collective Security Treaty Organization and are staunch followers of Russia in terms of diplomacy and security. In the end, Russia helped its “allies,” stabilizing the political situation in Belarus and Kyrgyzstan, and facilitated the final ceasefire in Nagorno-Karabakh through strong intervention, barely maintaining regional influence, but the cost was high: Russia provided Belarus with another 1.5 billion U.S. dollars in lending, forgave Kyrgyzstan’s tremendous debt and provided the country with financial assistance, not to mention other remaining issues. Instigated by the West, especially the United States, Russia now has more and more geopolitical opponents, and the surrounding areas are facing new pressure.

Some people, as represented by the former “think tank” Surkov, believe that Putin’s policies can make Russia a strong country with deep influence. 12 Some scholars have argued that there are realist and liberal alternatives to Russia’s path to recovery: Realism refers to a route that strengthens Russia’s sovereignty and makes Russia an autonomous and fully independent decision-making center, including cultural independence. 13 Liberalism refers to the desire to integrate into a Western-dominated global system in which rules, values, and priorities are set by the West."

At the same time, in order to alleviate what ails the people, issues that have accumulated over the years and ahve been aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic, Russia must increase investment in the social field and solve practical problems such as employment and poverty.

The “turn to the east” before 2014 was based on the fact that Russia, as a major Eurasian country, must ensure a relatively balanced development between the eastern region and the European part, and adjust the diplomatic strategy of “focusing on Europe and less on Asia” in the long run; on the other hand, Russia is trying to take advantage of the rapid economic growth of Asia-Pacific countries to promote the economic development of its eastern region. After the Ukraine crisis in 2014, along with the triple blow of the international oil price crash, Western sanctions and the devaluation of the ruble, Russia’s economic growth and international image have encountered severe challenges. Putin’s government has attempted to expand Russia’s diplomatic influence by accelerating the deployment of the “Turn to the East” strategy to find a breakthrough in reversing the passive state of geopolitics and a new growth point for economic recovery. 18 With Europe becoming more and more unreliable, for the first time since the Cold War, Russia has clearly focused its diplomacy on Asia, with particular emphasis on developing a comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination with China."

The nostalgia for the glory of the Soviet Union and the great power of the Russian Empire has been a powerful spiritual support but also comes with strong side effects. Neither Putin nor the Russian people can accept that the “dormant period” before the country’s revitalization will last too long. Eagerly looking for the road to a strong country, it is easy to fall into traditional thinking and methods. The information revolution has brought about industrial upgrading. While countries have accelerated the economic transformation of S&T innovation achievements and seized the top of the global product chain, Russia is still strengthening its traditional advantages in energy and raw materials. Economic development is difficult to achieve, so Putin has sought to “fulfill” the expectations of the people with a strong military and strong politics and uses the tools of public opinion to form efficient propaganda. Some analysts believe that from the “Crimea Consensus” to breakthroughs in cutting-edge weapons and military technology, Russia seems to be regaining its self-confidence as a great power, but it may miss good development opportunities to some extent."

"Russia’s Great Power Revival Strategy: Goals, Practices, and Challenges","Academic Journal of Russian Studies , Sun Zhuangzhi","Dec 10, 2021","If only measured by economic indicators, whether it is the rationality of the economic structure or the global ranking of its GDP, there is a certain gap between Russia and the standard of a global power. However, in terms of land area, resource endowment, and S&T potential, it is difficult for other countries to match Russia, and the country’s military strength, in particular, still causes great unease for the United States. Despite the unsatisfactory economic development, Putin’s national revitalization strategy has been widely recognized by domestic elites and ordinary people. A “strong Russia” must win the respect of the world, and the country has begun to restore its self-confidence as a great power. To a large extent, it reflects the actual national interests of Russia."
"Russia’s Great Power Revival Strategy: Goals, Practices, and Challenges","Academic Journal of Russian Studies , Sun Zhuangzhi","Dec 10, 2021","Today, people have come to widely different conclusions about whether Putin’s road to national revitalization has been successful or not due to different interpretations of his goals and based upon different standards. Some believe that Putin has fulfilled his original promise and that Russia has not only maintained its global leadership in some fields but has regained a pivotal international influence. Some say that the country’s strength and strategic position are still far behind those of the Soviet Union. Many other commentators feel that Russia cannot be truly rejuvenated and is actually in the process of decline, 22 as Putin’s efforts are nothing more than slowing down this inevitable trend. Therefore, Russia’s “revitalization” must be comprehensively measured from various aspects. Some fields must recover, and some fields must catch up to globally advanced levels. Putin’s goal of building a strong country was once formulated around economic recovery and growth. Later, under the impetus of the ruling authorities and social sentiments, it was redesigned as Russia’s national revival, not only in economic strength, but also political strength, military strength, ideological strength, and cultural strength. Based on this, the main starting point and foothold for his revival strategy was determined."

Russia must escape the difficult situation of internal and external difficulties, and Putin, who had been relatively cautious in policy, has responded and made strategic adjustments and continues to exert efforts at each level to strongly promote the integration of Russia and Belarus. On the international stage, Russia must pay more attention to its strategic relations with major powers, seek opportunities for dialog and easing relations with the United States and Europe, enhance interaction with emerging market countries such as China and India in global and regional governance, and jointly maintain the integrity of the multilateral system to ensure stability, close cooperation, and interaction in a range of international organizations. As an extension and expansion of the China-Russia strategic partnership of coordination at the regional level, the international influence of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) has been continuously enhanced. Putin particularly emphasized in November 2020 that the SCO member states should strengthen cooperation. In terms of domestic policy, Putin must focus on maintaining political stability and sovereignty security, on solving a series of urgent livelihood issues, unifying the strength of the country and enriching the people, and planning the sustainable development of the country over the long term."
Russia-Ukraine War Deeply Affects the Relationship Between Russia and the West,"China Social Sciences Network , Zhang Hong","Mar 1, 2022","Located in the eastern part of the European continent, Ukraine has been contested by different empires throughout history, with Tsarist Russia, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the Ottoman Turks all having ruled this land. Ukraine regained its independence after the Cold War, but was still unable to extricate itself from great power rivalry. The great powers have always been the dominant players in the international order, and are important factors influencing the international landscape and regional situation. Throughout the thirty years since the end of the Cold War, United States-Russian relations have been the most sensitive and fragile element of great power relations. On the morning of February 24, Russia declared war on Ukraine, triggering Europe’s most serious security crisis in the decades since the Cold War. This crisis is a major crisis not only in Russia-Ukraine relations, but also in Russia’s relationship with the West, marking a change in the way Moscow deals with the West, from dialogue in the past to the struggle of the present. The post-Cold War relationship of competition and cooperation between Russia and the West has ended. Multiple structural contradictions have accumulated, making the relationship difficult to reconcile in the short term."
Russia-Ukraine War Deeply Affects the Relationship Between Russia and the West,"China Social Sciences Network , Zhang Hong","Mar 1, 2022","First, the Russia-Ukraine war is a crisis in Russia’s security relations with NATO. Europe’s geo-security environment improved significantly after the Cold War ended, and the collapse of the Soviet Union and dissolution of the Warsaw Pact allowed Europe to again move toward dialogue and cooperation. However, Russia has never been able to achieve harmonious security relations with the West. Under Yeltsin’s administration, Russia even offered to join NATO. This was dismissed by the West. An offer to join NATO was also made during Putin’s [first] administration, but the United States did not respond. Under Medvedev, Russia also wanted to build a unified European security framework and called for a new European security treaty. “To achieve a breakthrough for the future, and to end almost 20 years of uncertainty and instability, requires collective political will,” he said. Moscow hoped to establish a unified and indivisible political-military security space in North America, Europe, and Central Asia. This reflected Russia’s concerns about its exclusion from the European security framework and its fears about NATO’s eastward expansion. Medvedev’s proposal reflected Russia’s attempt to change the NATO-dominated European security framework. It was an important attempt by Russia to reshape the strategic balance in Europe. However, the West reacted lukewarmly to this Russian initiative."
Russia-Ukraine War Deeply Affects the Relationship Between Russia and the West,"China Social Sciences Network , Zhang Hong","Mar 1, 2022","The West does not accept Russia’s participation in the European security-building system, and despite Russia’s opposition, it has continued to expand NATO’s membership, adopting a security policy of unilateral expansion that excludes Russia, expanding NATO’s membership from 16 to 30, gradually expanding its sphere of influence from Western, Southern and Central Europe during the Cold War to Eastern and Southeastern Europe, and extending from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea region, forming a complete strategic encirclement of Russia. While NATO was admitting countries in Central and Eastern Europe, it also set its sights on the “post-Soviet space.” Most of the “post-Soviet states” have joined NATO’s “Partnership for Peace.” The West has taken advantage of those states’ historical grievances and territorial disputes with Russia to actively support their bids to join NATO, with Ukraine and Georgia being the most proactive. After the 2014 Crimea crisis, Ukraine explicitly proposed joining NATO, and NATO accepted Ukraine as an associate member in 2020, granting Ukraine “NATO Capacity Enhancement Partner” status and implementing substantive security cooperation with it. U.S. and British troops are now permanently stationed in Ukraine on a rotating basis, ostensibly for military training missions or exercises."
Russia-Ukraine War Deeply Affects the Relationship Between Russia and the West,"China Social Sciences Network , Zhang Hong","Mar 1, 2022","Russia believes that NATO’s substantive cooperation with Ukraine threatens Moscow’s security, and has touched Russia’s “strategic red line.” In his state of the nation address in April 2021, Putin said that Russia has been restrained and modest, that it wants to maintain good relations with all its international partners, and that “we really do not want to burn bridges;” that some countries should not take Russia’s modesty as weakness, and that if anyone dares to cross Russia’s “red lines,” burning or even blowing up bridges, Russia’s response will be “disproportionate, swift and tough.” But diplomatic communication between Putin and Biden has not been smooth, with the United States and NATO rejecting Russia’s core security guarantee demands. In December 2021, Russia publicly proposed a draft Russia-U.S. security guarantee treaty and an agreement on security guarantee measures between Russia and NATO member states, demanding that NATO not be expanded and that Ukraine not join NATO; that Russia and NATO not deploy short- and medium-range missiles in areas where they can strike each other; and that the two sides’ military force deployments return to the positions set out in the 1997 Founding Act on Mutual Relations, Cooperation and Security between NATO and the Russian Federation. However, the United States and NATO clearly rejected Russia’s core demands. The West clearly underestimated Russia’s strategic counterattack ability and determination. As we have seen, in the absence of fruitful negotiations between Russia and NATO, Putin abandoned diplomatic efforts, quickly declared recognition of the independence of Ukraine’s Donbas region, and sent troops directly into Ukraine. On the morning of February 24, Russia declared war on Ukraine, taking military measures to reverse NATO’s offensive posture in Ukraine. The Russia-Ukraine war means a complete rupture of Russia-NATO relations and a return to confrontation and an arms race between the two sides."
Russia-Ukraine War Deeply Affects the Relationship Between Russia and the West,"China Social Sciences Network , Zhang Hong","Mar 1, 2022","Second, the Russia-Ukraine war is a crisis in the development path of Russia’s relationship with the West. Russia’s announcement that it was sending troops to Ukraine not only has security considerations, but also has profound political intentions. As Engels said, “men, consciously or unconsciously, derive their ethical ideas in the last resort from the … economic relations in which they carry on production and exchange.” From a political science perspective, a development path is essentially a value orientation that sums up the essence and purpose of a country’s social development, embodies the profound dialectic between tradition and modernity, democratization and national conditions, and requires the establishment of mechanisms that can ensure the realization of the concept of national development."
Russia-Ukraine War Deeply Affects the Relationship Between Russia and the West,"China Social Sciences Network , Zhang Hong","Mar 1, 2022","Since Putin came to power, Russia has moved away from the West’s understanding of the path of national development, and Russian politics has begun to return to conservative politics, abandoning the democratic model marketed to Russia by the West. Putin believes that “as a sovereign country, Russia can and will independently determine for itself the timeframe and the conditions for its advancement along that path [toward democracy],” and that “democratic values must be combined with national interests. The West has criticized Putin’s “sovereign democracy” and “controlled democracy,” and by supporting anti-Putin NGOs, has created a political force in Russia that supports the Western model of democracy. At the same time, the West has shifted the focus of its efforts to promote the Western model of democracy [from Russia] to Russia’s neighboring countries. In 2009, the European Union officially launched the “Eastern Partnership” program to integrate the “post-Soviet states,” using Free Trade Area agreements as bait to bring six neighboring countries—Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Moldova, Belarus and Ukraine—into the Western economic and political system."
Russia-Ukraine War Deeply Affects the Relationship Between Russia and the West,"China Social Sciences Network , Zhang Hong","Mar 1, 2022","In his speech on February 24, Putin clearly announced that Ukraine would be “de-Nazified” through military action. As is well known, it was the United States’ gross interference in Ukraine’s internal affairs in 2014 that led to the demonstrations and protests to turn into “regime change” in Ukraine. Putin’s statements on Ukrainian politics imply opposition to the path of national development given to Ukraine by the West. To quote Putin aide Vladislav Surkov, in his important article Putin’s Long-lasting Empire published in 2019, the “Putinist” political model will be an effective means of Russian national survival and development for the next 100 years. According to Surkov, the “Putin model” will not only be applicable to Russia, but also has “export” potential. Thus, after “de-Nazifying” Ukraine, it seems likely that Putin will replicate the Russian “Putin model” in Ukraine and replace the “Western model” with the “Putin model.”"
Russia-Ukraine War Deeply Affects the Relationship Between Russia and the West,"China Social Sciences Network , Zhang Hong","Mar 1, 2022","Again, the Russia-Ukraine war is a crisis in Russia’s diplomatic relations with the West. Starting with the reforms of Peter I in the 18th century, Russia began to Europeanize in the cultural realm, and after the reforms of Catherine II, Tsarist Russia became a European power for a time. However, Russia was once again marginalized after World War I. During the Soviet era, despite its great economic, military, scientific and diplomatic achievements, Russia remained in a protracted state of confrontation with the Western world, moving from Tsarist Russia’s position on the margins to the opposite side, becoming the Western world’s “East.” After the end of the Cold War, many Russians believed for a time that they could rejoin the Western world, once the differences between political systems and market models were eliminated. But Russia’s re-embrace of the Western world did not work out well, as the West enthusiastically accepted Central and Eastern European countries into its fold, and even considered certain “post-Soviet states” as potential targets. In the eyes of the West, Russia has always been the “other,” and European countries have likened the idea of Russia joining the EU to “an elephant getting in your bathtub.”"
Russia-Ukraine War Deeply Affects the Relationship Between Russia and the West,"China Social Sciences Network , Zhang Hong","Mar 1, 2022","Putin attached great importance to the development of relations with the United States after he came to power, and hoped to completely dismantle the “sticking points” in their relations. After the September 11 attacks, Putin called George W. Bush to express his full support for the United States in the fight against terrorism. He unexpectedly opened an air transport corridor to Afghanistan to the United States, and took the initiative in sharing counterterrorism intelligence with the United States. During the Obama administration, the U.S. and Russian leaders made efforts to “reboot” relations after the Russia-Georgia war, and in the face of multiple rounds of U.S. sanctions after the 2014 Ukraine crisis, Putin did not forgo opportunities to improve relations. Russia has also taken great pains in its relations with Europe. During the Yeltsin era, Russia quickly agreed to withdraw its troops from Eastern Europe, and it supported the option of Central and Eastern Europe joining the European Union. From the 1990s until the2008 Russia-Georgia War, Russia maintained friendly diplomatic relations and relatively close economic cooperation with Europe. During the administration of Chancellor Schröder in Germany, Russia joined Germany, France, and others in opposing the U.S. war in Iraq. Under Merkel’s administration, despite the impact of sanctions from the 2014 Ukraine crisis, Russia continued to expand its energy exports to Europe, and completed construction of the Nord Stream II gas pipeline."
Russia-Ukraine War Deeply Affects the Relationship Between Russia and the West,"China Social Sciences Network , Zhang Hong","Mar 1, 2022","Throughout the thirty years since the end of the Cold War, Russia has made improving its relationship with the West one of its diplomatic priorities, and Moscow has maintained a great deal of strategic patience with the West, which once accepted Russia into the G7. However, the West has never really accepted Russia, has always seen Russia as the main security threat, and has continued to encroach upon and encircle Russia’s strategic space. The West has not only integrated former Warsaw Pact members into the Western political, economic and security system, but is also preparing to integrate the “post-Soviet space” into the West. The West has completely ignored Moscow’s desire to integrate into the West, and has exhausted Russia’s strategic patience with the Western world. Since the Biden administration came into office, the United States has reorganized the West’s “united front” against Russia, rebuilding a united diplomatic and military front against Russia. In 2021, the United States and the European Union together introduced several sanctions against Russia and expelled Russian diplomats. These joint actions left Moscow feeling there was almost zero room for improving relations with the West. In early 2022, Washington’s smear campaign against Russia reached an extreme, with the United States and Britain escalating the “Russian threat theory” into a “Russian invasion theory,” and the atmosphere for dialogue with the West was completely lost. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov reluctantly compared the dialogue between the Russian and British foreign ministers on Ukraine as “a dialogue between a mute person and a deaf person.”"
Russia-Ukraine War Deeply Affects the Relationship Between Russia and the West,"China Social Sciences Network , Zhang Hong","Mar 1, 2022","The Russia-Ukraine war is an important turning point in Russia’s relations with the West, reflecting the fact that the differences between Russia and the West in terms of security concepts, values and worldview are escalating into a huge “conflict” that is difficult to reconcile. Putin’s actions in Ukraine mark a complete paradigm shift Russia’s dealings with the West. Communication has become very difficult because of the huge differences in perceptions between the two sides, and the differences rapidly escalate into conflicts, which intensify into war.

In fact, the upward momentum of Sino-European relations had been sudden and powerful thanks to the rising tide of economic globalization and European integration, and then, with the falling tide of the latter, there followed a very rapid downward slide. China’s accession to the WTO in 2001 put economic globalization in the fast lane, and Sino-European relations consequently experienced a honeymoon. The international financial crisis and European sovereign debt crisis of 2008 and 2009 opened a Pandora’s box, triggering multiple crises in Europe and elsewhere. Frictions gradually arose in Sino-European relations as well.

The confusion of European elites over China and their anxious “sense of insecurity” have been growing day by day. As a result, since early 2021, the EU leadership, experts on European strategy, and some politicians in some of the core member states have formed an increasingly negative view of China and have become ever more pessimistic about Sino-European relations.

In particular, when direct confrontation occurs between China and the United States and the United States adopts a tough attitude towards China, the EU and its member states may hedge their bets and adopt a mindset of seeking to profit from both sides. On the one hand, the EU will stand behind the United States and push it to keep toughening its attitude towards China so as to force China to make concessions with regard to systems and mechanisms or even at the fundamental institutional level. It will let the United States “pull Europe’s chestnuts out of the fire,” that is, do things on behalf of Europe that Europe itself is unable or unwilling to do. On the other hand, it will seek to use the considerable pressure placed on China by the China-U.S. confrontation to force China to make further concessions to the EU."

In his report, General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that the five years since the 18th Party Congress have been an extremely remarkable five years in the development process of the Party and the country. Over the past five years, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core has scientifically grasped the development trends of today’s world and contemporary China, adapted to practical requirements and the aspirations of the people, raised the flag to set the orientation and devised strategies, taken command of the great struggle, the great project, the great cause, and the great dream, and holistically promoted the “Five Spheres in One” overall layout and coordinated the promotion of the “Four Comprehensives” strategic layout. With great political courage and a strong readiness to shoulder responsibility, it has proposed a series of new concepts, new ideas, and new strategies, issued a series of major principles and policies, introduced a series of major measures, and promoted a series of major tasks. It has solved many difficult problems that for a long time solutions were hoped for but not found, accomplished many great things that had previously been wanted but not accomplished, and promoted historic changes in the cause of the Party and the country. The face of the Party, the face of the country, the face of the people, the face of the military, and the face of the Chinese nation have undergone unprecedented changes. These historic changes are comprehensive and groundbreaking, they are deep-seated and fundamental, and they have a significant and far-reaching impact on the development of the Party and the country. After long-term efforts, socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era. This is a new historical orienting point in China’s development. The entrance of socialism with Chinese characteristics into a new era means that the Chinese nation, which since modern times has suffered so much, has welcomed the great leap from standing up and becoming rich to becoming strong and has welcomed a bright future for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. It means that scientific socialism resounds with great vitality in 21st century China and has raised high the great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics on the world stage. It means that the path, theory, system, and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics continue to develop, and have opened up a path for developing countries to modernize, providing a brand-new choice for those countries and nations in the world who want to both accelerate their development and maintain their independence, and contributing Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions to solving the problems of humanity. This new era is an era of inheriting the past and ushering in the future, continuing the past and opening up the future, and continuing to win the great victory of socialism with Chinese characteristics under new historical conditions. It is an era of decisive victory in building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and from there building a powerful modern socialist country in an all-round way. It is an era in which people of all ethnic groups throughout the country will work together in unity, constantly create better lives, and gradually realize common prosperity for all the people. It is an era when all Chinese sons and daughters work together with one heart and strive to realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. It is an era in which China is increasingly approaching the center of the world stage and continues to make greater contributions to mankind. With the entrance of socialism with Chinese characteristics into a new era, the principal contradiction in our society has transformed into the contradiction between the people’s ever-growing needs for a better life and unbalanced and inadequate development, which has introduced many new demands for the work of the Party and the state. That socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era is of major significance in the history of the development of the People’s Republic of China and the development of the Chinese nation, as well as in the history of the development of world socialism and the history of human society. We must deeply realize that the most important and critical reason that the Party and the country can achieve brilliant achievements and historic changes is that our Party has General Secretary Xi Jinping as the core leader at the helm and has the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core. We must resolutely protect the core position and authority of General Secretary Xi Jinping, resolutely protect the authority and the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, and continuously push forward various undertakings in accordance with the requirements of the new era."
Speech by Comrade Chen Quanguo at the First and Second Plenary Sessions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Ninth Committee of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the Chinese Communist Party,Chen Quanguo,"Oct 30, 2017","(ii) New thought leads the way forward. Since the 18th Party Congress, the members of the CCP, with General Secretary Xi Jinping as their main representative, focused on the major epochal question of what kind of socialism with Chinese characteristics to uphold and develop in the new era and how to uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics, took a brand-new perspective to deepen understanding of the laws of Communist Party rule, the laws of socialist construction, and the laws of the development of human society, carried out arduous theoretical explorations, and achieved major theoretical innovations, thereby forming Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is the inheritance and development of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the important thought of “Three Represents,” and the Scientific Outlook on Development. It is the latest achievement of the Sinicization of Marxism. It is the crystallization of the practical experience and collective wisdom of the Party and the people. It is an important part of the theoretical system of socialism with Chinese characteristics. It is the ideological beacon, spiritual pillar, source of strength, and magic weapon of victory for the Chinese Communists in the new era. It is the action plan for the whole Party and the people of all ethnic groups nationwide to strive for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. It is the guiding ideology that our Party must adhere to over the long term. It is a concentrated demonstration of the great theoretical courage, extraordinary political wisdom, and profound original ideas of General Secretary Xi Jinping and will inevitably lead the ship carrying the great dream of the Chinese people as it breaks through the waves and sails victoriously to the glorious shore so as to make the Chinese nation stand more loftily in the forest of world nations. We must firmly grasp the main connotations of the “Eight Clarifications” of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and the basic strategy of the “Fourteen Commitments,” unswervingly hold high the great banner of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, unswervingly unify thinking and arm the mind with Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and unswervingly implement Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era throughout the entire process of promoting social stability and long-term stability in Xinjiang and of building a Chinese socialist Xinjiang (中国特色社会主义新疆), and embody it in all aspects of Party building."
Speech by Comrade Chen Quanguo at the First and Second Plenary Sessions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Ninth Committee of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the Chinese Communist Party,Chen Quanguo,"Oct 30, 2017","(iii) The new mission brings together boundless strength. In his report, General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that the original intention and mission of the Chinese Communists was to pursue happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation. Today, we are closer to achieving the goal of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation than at any other time in history, and are more confident and capable of doing so. The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is not something that can be achieved easily, by just making a lot of celebratory noises. The whole Party must be prepared to make harder and more difficult efforts. To achieve great dreams, we must engage in great struggles. This struggle is a great struggle with many new historical features. We must more consciously uphold the Party’s leadership and China’s socialist system and resolutely oppose all words and deeds that weaken, distort, or deny the Party’s leadership and China’s socialist system. We must more consciously protect the interests of the people and resolutely oppose all acts that harm the interests of the people and separate from the masses. We must more consciously devote ourselves to the epochal trend of reform and innovation and resolutely eliminate all stubborn diseases. We must more consciously safeguard China’s sovereignty, security, and development interests and resolutely oppose all acts that split the motherland and undermine national unity and social harmony and stability. We must more consciously prevent all types of risks and resolutely overcome all difficulties and challenges in the political, economic, cultural, social, and other fields as well as in the natural world. We must fully understand the protracted, complex, and arduous nature of this great struggle, develop the spirit of struggle, improve our abilities for struggle, and continuously win new victories in the great struggle. To achieve great dreams, we must build a great project. This great project is the new great project of Party building that our Party is currently advancing in a deep-reaching way. We must more consciously uphold the principles of Party spirit, courageously face problems head-on, dare to scrape to the bone to remove the poison, eliminate all factors that damage the advanced nature and purity of the Party, clear away all the viruses that erode the Party’s healthy body, continuously enhance the Party’s political leadership, ideological leadership, mass organization capabilities, and social appeal, and ensure that our Party will always maintain strong vitality and strong combat effectiveness. To achieve great dreams, we must pursue a great cause. This great cause is the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics. It is necessary to more consciously enhance self-confidence in this road, theory, system, and culture, rather than taking the old road of closure and rigidity or the wrong road of changing our banner. We must maintain our political steadfastness, insist on working hard to rejuvenate our country, and always uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics. We must firmly grasp the original intention and mission of the Chinese Communists and, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core, integrate efforts to conduct the great struggle, construct the great project, advance the great cause, and realize the great dream, threading them together and advancing them in combination. With this, in the great practice of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, we will better shoulder the historical mission of building a Chinese socialist Xinjiang."

In his report, General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that the period from the 19th Party Congress to the 20th Party Congress is the historical intersection of the Two Centenary Goals. We must both build to completion a moderately prosperous society in all respects and achieve the first centenary goal, and also take advantage of this momentum to start a new journey of building a modern socialist country in an all-round way and march towards the second centenary goal. In the comprehensive analysis of the international and domestic situation and China’s development conditions, the period from 2020 to the middle of this century can be arranged in two stages. The first stage, from 2020 to 2035, based on having built a moderately prosperous society in all respects, will basically achieve socialist modernization. The second stage, from 2035 to the middle of the century, will establish China as powerful modern socialist country that is rich, strong, democratic, civilized, harmonious, and beautiful. This strategic arrangement shows that our Party will lead the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country to complete the second centenary goal 15 years ahead of schedule, so that the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation presents a new picture. We must firmly grasp the new goal of building a modern socialist country in an all-round way in two steps. According to the blueprint drawn up by the 19th Party Congress, we will grasp the objective like deeply rooted bamboo in the wind refusing to let go, roll up our sleeves and redouble our efforts. With unrelenting hard work and perseverance, we will courageously forge ahead to new goals."

In the construction of ecological civilization, we must practice the concept that clean waters and green mountains are invaluable assets, accelerate the reform of the ecological civilization institutions, form spatial patterns, industrial structures, production methods, and lifestyles that save resources and protect the environment, and build a beautiful China.

General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that “comprehensive and strict governance of the Party is an endless journey” and “the key to doing a good job of Xinjiang work lies in the Party.” We must resolutely implement the General Secretary’s important instructions, conscientiously implement the general requirements of Party building in the new era, unswervingly govern the party comprehensively and strictly, treat the Party’s political construction as the commander, comprehensively strengthen the Party’s political construction, ideological construction, organizational construction, work style construction, and discipline construction, and incorporate institutional construction throughout this process. We must persist in giving political construction top priority, effectively strengthen political consciousness, big-picture consciousness, core consciousness, and alignment consciousness, and view protecting General Secretary Xi Jinping, the core, as the greatest politics and the most important political discipline and political rule. We must identify with the core ideologically, protect the core politically, obey the core organizationally, and follow the core closely in action. We must firmly defend the core, love the core, and be absolutely loyal to the core, ensuring that although Xinjiang is far from the capital Beijing, the hearts of the Party committee of the autonomous region, Party organizations at all levels regionwide, and the vast ranks of Party members, and of cadres and people of all ethnic groups, are always closely attached to and closely linked with the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core. At all times and under any circumstances, we must maintain a high degree of consistency with the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core in ideology, politics, and action, maintain a high degree of consistency with the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core in terms of political position, political direction, political principles, and political path, resolutely protect the authority and the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, implement without compromise the decisions and deployments of the Party Central Committee, and obey the orders and commands of the Party Central Committee in all our actions. We must unswervingly arm the mind with Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, achieve an in-depth understanding of the context of the era, historical status, scientific system, spiritual essence, and practical requirements of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, achieve an in-depth understanding of the firm faith and convictions, the clear-cut people’s standpoint, the strong historical responsibility, the truth-seeking and pragmatic style, the brave innovative spirit, and the scientific methodology that run through it, consolidate the foundation of faith, take spiritual “calcium” supplements, and keep a steady hand on the rudder of thought, and consciously be firm believers and loyal practitioners of the lofty ideals of Communism and the common ideals of socialism with Chinese characteristics. We must strengthen the building of leadership teams and the ranks of cadres, adhere to the principle of the Party’s management of cadres, insist on both morality and talent with priority given to morality, insist on searching all corners of the country and appointing people on their merits, insist on putting the cause first and acting in a fair and upright manner, insist on good cadre standards, place special emphasis on political standards, and promote and appoint cadres who are firmly grounded in the “Four Consciousnesses” and “Four Matters of Confidence,” who resolutely protect the authority of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core, who fully implement the Party’s theory, line, principles, and policies, and who are loyal, honest, and responsible. We must focus on cultivating and training, and selecting and using, cadres in complex environments and on the front lines of the anti-separatist struggle, in village-stationed work and village-stationed work for managing places of worship, at the county, township and primary levels, and in hardship and remote areas, treat village stationing, village stationing to manage places of worship, and work in inland working groups and port working groups as important conditions for selecting and appointing cadres, and strive to build a high-quality and professional team of cadres. We must strengthen the construction of primary-level organizations and primary-level state powers, adhere to the focus on improving organizational strength, highlight political functions, give full play to the role of the village-stationed work teams and first secretaries, continue to rectify weak and lax primary-level Party organizations, promote the full coverage of primary-level Party organizations, and effectively build primary-level Party organizations into strong fighting fortresses for propagating the Party’s propositions, implementing the Party’s decisions, leading primary-level governance, uniting and mobilizing the masses, and promoting reform and development. We must focus on the development and growth of the ranks of Party members, focus on industrial workers, young farmers, students, and other groups, develop [people into] Party members on the frontlines of anti-terrorism, stability maintenance, and anti-separatist struggles, pay attention to the development of [people] from ethnic minorities into Party members, and give full play to the vanguard and exemplary role of Communist Party members. We must deeply promote the construction of Party style and clean government and the anti-corruption struggle and firmly establish the thought that although Xinjiang is at the forefront of the anti-separatist struggle and is the main battlefield, and the task of countering terrorism and maintaining stability is heavy, it has no special status as regards the issue of building Party style and clean government and struggling against corruption. We must adhere to the struggle against separatism on the one hand and the construction of a clean government and the struggle against corruption on the other hand, conscientiously implement principal responsibility and supervision responsibilities, resolutely implement the spirit of the Central Committee’s Eight-Point Regulations, persevere with integrity, discipline, and unremittingly rectify the “Four Malfeasances” (四风) and “Four Energies” (四气). We must insist on no forbidden zones, full coverage, and zero tolerance, adhere to a focus on containment, strong pressure, and long-term deterrence, insist on the blade of inspections being raised high, and consolidate the overwhelming momentum of the anti-corruption struggle. We must strengthen deterrence so that people dare not be corrupt, build a tight cage leaving them unable to be corrupt, and strengthen self-consciousness so that people do not want to be corrupt, and create a clean and upright political ecosystem, providing a strong guarantee for the realization of the overall goal of social stability and long-term stability."

General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out: “ideological construction is the Party’s foundational construction.” Thought is the precursor of action, and scientific thought is the guiding light that shows the path. Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is the biggest theoretical gain and achievement of our Party since the 18th Party Congress. It is the greatest highlight and the biggest historical contribution of the report to the 19th Party Congress. It is another historic leap in the integration of Marxism-Leninism with China’s reality. It is a guide to action for the whole Party and the whole people to strive for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Shining bright and dazzling with the light of Marxist truth, it has opened up a new realm of the Sinicization of Marxism. We must be sure to treat Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as the ideological soul that guides all work, the beacon of progress, and our scientific guide; as a fixed star, compass, and navigator in managing the fundamentals, the direction, and the long-term; and as the spiritual pillar, source of strength, and victory-securing magic weapon of all Party members and cadres.

They are dear, lovable, and respected members of our family. We must be sure not to forget our original intention and keep our mission in mind, adhere to the people-centered development philosophy, always keep the people of all ethnic groups in the highest position in our hearts, always take the people’s yearning for a better life as the goal of our struggle, and always desire to be together, and work together, with people of all ethnic groups, caring for them passionately and loving them. With the readiness to shoulder responsibility of “hoping that everyone is full and warm” and with love for the people like “caring for each branch and each leaf,” we must do more heart-warming projects that improve production and living conditions, do more practical deeds that benefit the people, solve more practical difficulties of concern to people of all ethnic groups, and focus on the interest-related problems that most concern and most directly and practically affect the masses.

Standardized Algorithm Recommendations: Developing Science and Technology Legal Theory,Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC),"Mar 3, 2022","With the increasingly widespread application of digital technology, algorithms are gradually playing an increasingly important role in social production and daily life. We are gradually entering a world where “algorithms are everywhere.” Algorithms are not only bridges that allow people to obtain useful information in the ever-expanding Internet information ocean, but also the keys to making data and hardware resources better serve their functions. They are of great significance in the construction of digital China. However, at the same time, with the continuous increase in social digitization and intelligence, many issues such as algorithm security, algorithm black boxes, algorithm discrimination, and information cocoons (信息茧房) have received a high level of attention worldwide. Countries are actively exploring how to better respond and solve these issues. On December 31, 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of Public Security, and the State Administration for Market Regulation jointly issued the Provisions on the Administration of Algorithm-generated Recommendations for Internet Information Services (hereinafter referred to as the Provisions) to be implemented from March 1, 2022. The Provisions aim to regulate the algorithm recommendation activities of Internet information services, safeguard national security and the public interest, protect the legitimate rights and interests of citizens, legal persons, and other organizations, and promote the healthy development of Internet information services. The publication and implementation of the Provisions is a positive response to algorithm recommendation, a prominent issue of widespread concern in China’s network governance field. It is a specific legal norm established for the recommendations of Internet information service algorithms, the first of its kind in the world. It is a useful supplement to the legal order system of an intelligent society and an important exploration for the in-depth integration and development of the construction of “Digital China” and “China under the Rule of Law.” The specific normative measures in the Regulations reflect China’s exploration, development, and implementation of science and technology (S&T) legal theory in S&T development and application. In particular, it embodies the following principles:"
Standardized Algorithm Recommendations: Developing Science and Technology Legal Theory,Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC),"Mar 3, 2022",I. The Principle of Combining Ethics with the Rule of Law
Standardized Algorithm Recommendations: Developing Science and Technology Legal Theory,Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC),"Mar 3, 2022","The Provisions adopt a rule-setting model that combines overall principles with ethical rules in specific fields and links S&T ethics with entity responsibility, combining ethics and the rule of law in a more organic and scientific manner. In recent years, many countries, regions, organizations, and enterprises have successively issued ethical guidelines for artificial intelligence (AI) and automated systems. These guidelines received great interest from China. For example, the Governance Principles for a New Generation of Artificial Intelligence: Developing Responsible Artificial Intelligence published by the National New Generation Artificial Intelligence Governance Specialist Committee achieved a high degree of consensus on the values of putting people first, promoting innovation, ensuring security, protecting privacy, and clarifying responsibilities. Article 4 of the Provisions stipulates that we “respect social morality and ethics, abide by business ethics and professional ethics, and follow the principles of fairness, openness, transparency, scientific rationality, and good faith.” Some important ethical principles in this field are absorbed as general principles to be followed by algorithm recommendation activities. At the same time, it also implemented specific targeted regulations for some key areas. For example, Article 8 stipulates that “it is prohibited to set up algorithm models that violate public order and good manners, such as inducing users to indulge in addiction or excessive consumption.” This two-level embedding of ethics in legal norms reflects that, in the stage of rapid technological development and changes and the ongoing exploration of the legal order for an intelligent society, we must rely to a certain extent on the idea of linking the rule of law with ethics. At the same time, in order to better guide enterprises to pay attention to S&T ethics and take corresponding measures, compared with the draft for comment released in August 2021, requirements for the establishment of management systems and technical measures such as “S&T ethics review” were specifically added in Article 7 of the Provisions as an important area for enterprises to implement their responsibilities as algorithm security entities."
Standardized Algorithm Recommendations: Developing Science and Technology Legal Theory,Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC),"Mar 3, 2022","II. The Principle of Mutual Construction, Mutual Governance, and Mutual Enjoyment"
Standardized Algorithm Recommendations: Developing Science and Technology Legal Theory,Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC),"Mar 3, 2022","Ideas and theories such as “mutual construction, mutual governance, and mutual enjoyment” and building a “community of social governance” have pointed out an important development direction for social governance in the new era, and also laid a local theoretical foundation for the pluralistic mutual governance of algorithms. The Provisions focus on establishing specific norms for government supervision and management, the promotion of enterprise self-governance, the encouragement of industry self-discipline, the development of industry standards, and the facilitation of citizen rights protection. It is conducive to promoting the joint participation of diverse entities in algorithm governance, It is the specific implementation of the idea and basic theory of “mutual construction, mutual governance, and mutual enjoyment” in the field of algorithm governance."
Standardized Algorithm Recommendations: Developing Science and Technology Legal Theory,Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC),"Mar 3, 2022",III. The Principle of Hierarchical and Classified Algorithm Governance
Standardized Algorithm Recommendations: Developing Science and Technology Legal Theory,Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC),"Mar 3, 2022","Cyberspace is hierarchically divided and all-encompassing. Hierarchical and classified governance is a common principle in the rule of law for networks and information. This is embodied in the Cybersecurity Law, the Data Security Law, and the Personal Information Protection Law. Article 19 of the Provisions specifically stipulates that the cybersecurity and informatization departments, in conjunction with telecommunications, public security, market supervision, and other relevant departments, shall establish a hierarchical and classified security management system for algorithms, which is the concentrated embodiment of the principle of hierarchical and classified governance. In addition, currently, the principle of hierarchical and classified governance is mainly reflected in two aspects in the Provisions: First, for “algorithm recommendation services with public opinion attributes or social mobilization capabilities,” because they involve national security risks, in addition to the general rules in the Provisions, special obligations for “algorithm filing” and “self-assessment” are also established. Second, targeted regulations are established for some specific categories of services, such as the provision of services to minors (Article 18), the provision of services to the elderly (Article 19), the provision of work scheduling services to workers (Article 20), and the sale of goods or provision of services to consumers (Article 21). Hierarchical and classified governance avoids coarse-grained “one-size-fits-all” legislation and is conducive to enhancing the pertinence, scientific nature, and effectiveness of legal norms."
Standardized Algorithm Recommendations: Developing Science and Technology Legal Theory,Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC),"Mar 3, 2022",IV. The Principle of Equal Emphasis on Security and Development
Standardized Algorithm Recommendations: Developing Science and Technology Legal Theory,Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC),"Mar 3, 2022","Resolving the conflicts between security and development, between order and vitality, is the difficulty and focus of the field of S&T rule of law. The formulation of the Provisions fully embodied the basic principle of giving equal emphasis to security and development. For example, the Provisions require that users be provided with a function to “select or delete” user labels, which reflects the comprehensive consideration of the interests of multiple parties and the scientific nature of the system. Another example is the establishment of the algorithm filing system, which embodies the characteristics of flexible governance and provides a variety of complex functions, including information collection functions, information publicity functions, and enterprise self-government incentive functions. Going forward, systems such as algorithm filing still need to be further refined. In the process of refinement, we must adhere to the principle of giving equal emphasis to security and development. China has some world-leading advantages in the new round of industrial revolution. To properly leverage these advantages and ensure the healthy development of the digital economy, it is urgently necessary to explore an effective path for algorithm governance. The promulgation and implementation of the Provisions not only provide a systematic governance path for algorithm issues that arise in practice, but also implement the legal principles summarized and developed in the practice of S&T rule of law in China. It has also made useful innovations and explorations in the construction of specific norms, providing an important foundation for the construction of a more comprehensive and deeper S&T legal system for the future."

These videos received a very high number of playbacks. Given that ByteDance knew, or should have known, that this was infringing content, it failed to perform its duty of reasonable care, there was subjective fault, and it had infringed on iQIYI’s right of information network dissemination for “Story of Yanxi Palace.”"

Standardizing Platform Recommendations: It’s Not That Simple,"Caijing E-Law E, Chen Bing","Mar 24, 2022","The People’s Court of Haidian District, Beijing held that ByteDance had sufficient conditions, capabilities, and reasonable grounds to know that many of its Toutiao users had committed a large number of infringing behaviors, and that this constituted a case of “should know” as stipulated in law. The measures taken by ByteDance in this case had failed to reach the “necessary” level. ByteDance had not only provided information storage space services, but had also provided information stream recommendation services, and should have fulfilled a higher duty of care with respect to users’ infringements. In the end, the court held that ByteDance’s conduct in this case constituted assisted infringement, and ordered that ByteDance compensate iQIYI for 1.5 million RMB in economic losses and 500,000 RMB in reasonable litigation expenses, a total of 2 million RMB."
Standardizing Platform Recommendations: It’s Not That Simple,"Caijing E-Law E, Chen Bing","Mar 24, 2022","This case prompted people to think about tort liability in the use of algorithm recommendation technology. For example, how can we identify subjective fault and behavioral components of a platform when using algorithm recommendations? Does the platform have the obligation to review the specific content recommended by algorithms, and what is the legal basis for this? If the platform must undertake this obligation, to what extent does this obligation extend? As a provider of algorithm recommendation services, how can the platform effectively defend itself legally? Etc."
Standardizing Platform Recommendations: It’s Not That Simple,"Caijing E-Law E, Chen Bing","Mar 24, 2022","In fact, when a platform provides algorithm recommendation services, there are two difficulties in judging whether its recommendation behavior constitutes infringement."
Standardizing Platform Recommendations: It’s Not That Simple,"Caijing E-Law E, Chen Bing","Mar 24, 2022","First, the service model of algorithm recommendation is to obtain user authorization. The platform then pushes personalized content after analyzing user behavior through the algorithm. Although the right to decide to accept the pushed content rests with the user, the control over material actions, such as the generation and synthesis of specific content as well as the push method, time, frequency, and effect, rests with the platform. The question is whether, after accepting the user’s choice, the platform still needs to take the initiative to conduct a substantive review of the recommended content and methods, and based on this, judge whether the platform knows or should know the effect of its behavior and must bear the legal duty of care."
Standardizing Platform Recommendations: It’s Not That Simple,"Caijing E-Law E, Chen Bing","Mar 24, 2022","Second, based on the platform’s material control over the algorithm recommendation service, it should assume more obligations for the legal and regulatory compliance of the recommended content and formats. According to the controller principle ubiquitous in the data field, the determination of responsibility for platform algorithm recommendation behavior can also be handled with reference to the controller principle. That is, the platform, as the main controller of the algorithm recommendation service, has the first and primary responsibility, and it is necessary to clarify the effectiveness and appropriateness of necessary measures taken by the platform. In this way, we can identify and determine what obligations the platform should undertake in practice as a user and controller of algorithm recommendation technology as well as the legal defense rights enjoyed by the platform. At the same time, in addition to the platform’s duty of care with regard to the use of algorithm recommendation technology, should it also undertake necessary review responsibilities for the content and objects involved in the technology? If so, does this mean that the platform needs, to some extent, to intervene or restrict its users’ right to choose or even their right to self-determination with respect to information services?"
Standardizing Platform Recommendations: It’s Not That Simple,"Caijing E-Law E, Chen Bing","Mar 24, 2022","This once again raises the possibility of detracting from the rights and interests of users in order to regulate platforms. That is, for the purpose of consolidating or even expanding the platform’s duty of care, should they be granted more control powers? Although this could prevent and limit the harm caused by a platform’s abuse of algorithm technology and protect the legitimate rights and interests of other operators, it may also improperly detract from the legitimate rights and interests of consumers and users on the platform. If we want to balance the legitimate rights and interests of various subjects in the algorithm recommendation service process, this is an unavoidable problem. Further, at a deeper level, this involves finding a balance between regulating the use of algorithms and incentivizing algorithm innovation."
Standardizing Platform Recommendations: It’s Not That Simple,"Caijing E-Law E, Chen Bing","Mar 24, 2022",How to Identify What a Platform “Should Know”
Standardizing Platform Recommendations: It’s Not That Simple,"Caijing E-Law E, Chen Bing","Mar 24, 2022","It is generally believed that “knows” (明知) implies that the platform is clearly aware of the existence of infringement. In practice, this is generally reflected in knowledge from a notification (通知知道) or “actual knowledge” (实际知道) about the existence of infringement through a channel such as a contract negotiation or business cooperation. The term “should know” (应知), meanwhile, indicates that, after fulfilling its reasonable duty of care, the platform should be aware of infringement. The former [“knows”] looks at whether the platform has actively intervened in infringing content and behavior, while the latter [“should know”] is more concerned with whether the platform has passively failed to fulfill its due duty of care obligations. At the same time, the latter is more complicated than the former."
Standardizing Platform Recommendations: It’s Not That Simple,"Caijing E-Law E, Chen Bing","Mar 24, 2022","When investigating whether a platform “should know” of the existence of infringement, the judgment must take the platform’s duty of care and its performance thereof into account."
Standardizing Platform Recommendations: It’s Not That Simple,"Caijing E-Law E, Chen Bing","Mar 24, 2022","When interpreting “should know”, attention should be paid to the difference between “should have known” (应当知道) and “presumed to know” (推定知道). “Should have known” should be interpreted as “should have known but did not know,” and not as “presumed to know.” A judgment of “should have known but did not know” is based on the existence of a legal or agreed obligation that the entity “should know,” and so it corresponds to the subjective state of negligence on the part of the actor. However, there is no corresponding basic obligation implied by “presumption of knowledge,” and the state of an actor’s “knowing” is a conclusion drawn from the existence of certain facts or the occurrence of certain behaviors. Article 1197 of the Civil Code stipulates: “If a network service provider knows or should know that a network user uses its network services in infringement of the civil-law rights and interests of others and fails to take necessary measures, it shall be jointly and severally liable with the network user.” By interpreting “should know” as “should have known but did not know” we include the state of negligence in the scope of application of Article 1197 of the Civil Code, which gives “should know” an independent position in relation to “knows” and harmonizes the internal structure of the law. This is a fairly reasonable interpretation."
Standardizing Platform Recommendations: It’s Not That Simple,"Caijing E-Law E, Chen Bing","Mar 24, 2022","Let us take the iQIYI vs. ByteDance case as a specific example. The court held that although in the warning letter and lawyer’s letter sent by iQIYI to ByteDance there was no information, such as URLs of relevant short videos, which could be used to precisely locate infringing files, based on factors such as the TV drama’s popularity, the characteristics of the content pushed by the algorithm used by ByteDance, the short videos’ popularity and user feedback, it could be determined that ByteDance had the sufficient conditions, capabilities, and reasonable grounds to know about the existence of infringing behavior on the platform which it operates."
Standardizing Platform Recommendations: It’s Not That Simple,"Caijing E-Law E, Chen Bing","Mar 24, 2022","Considering the vast amount of internet information, as network service providers, platform entities generally do not have the obligation to actively review content, and fulfilling the obligation of active review would increase the burden on platforms to an unreasonable degree. However, compared with the previous provisions of Article 36, paragraph 3 of the Tort Law, the amendment of Article 1197 of the Civil Code that changed “knows” to “knows or should know” actually reflects more stringent requirements: due to factors such as the high risk of infringement in some sectors, the method and nature of network service providers’ services, and their own nature and professional capabilities, even in the face of massive amounts of information, some network service providers should bear the obligation of actively reviewing content before the fact."
Standardizing Platform Recommendations: It’s Not That Simple,"Caijing E-Law E, Chen Bing","Mar 24, 2022","On this point, compared with ordinary network service providers, platforms have advantages with respect to data, technology, and capital scale. As soon as they begin using algorithm technology to realize or assist in realizing infringing behavior, the damage caused will be more serious. In practice, platforms undertake public affairs functions such as platform-centric cyberspace control and management, which is the biggest difference between platforms and ordinary network service providers. If a platform algorithm has added instructions or standards for actively screening and pushing infringing content, its infringing behavior constitutes “knowing” infringement. If the platform has the information management capabilities to intervene and adjust the push results, and other factors are present such as alleged infringement on relatively well-known works, it can be determined that the platform acted with subjective fault, and this constitutes an instance where the platform “should know” of the infringement. Based on this, it is reasonable to require platforms to undertake a certain degree of duty of care."
Standardizing Platform Recommendations: It’s Not That Simple,"Caijing E-Law E, Chen Bing","Mar 24, 2022","Of course, the understanding and interpretation of platform duty of care are not unchanging. The specific type of platform, technical conditions, degree of involvement, popularity of works, and so on are all factors that affect the interpretation of duty of care. However, in identifying the degree of duty of care borne by the platform, the basic principles and analytical framework used should remain stable. That is, it should be judged in light of the platform’s ability to use and manage information, and the relationship between the platform’s legitimate rights and corresponding obligations should be balanced. On this basis, comprehensive consideration should be given to the platform business type, scale, industry standards, business model, and other factors and individual circumstances. It should not be too mechanical."
Standardizing Platform Recommendations: It’s Not That Simple,"Caijing E-Law E, Chen Bing","Mar 24, 2022",How to Identify the Platform’s “Necessary Measures”
Standardizing Platform Recommendations: It’s Not That Simple,"Caijing E-Law E, Chen Bing","Mar 24, 2022","In the case of iQIYI vs. ByteDance, the court held that in judging whether the platform had taken the necessary measures, it had to look not only at means and methods, but also at whether the due effect and purpose had been achieved. Determining effect could not be based solely on whether infringing content was deleted and the time of deletion. Specifically, first, after the date on which ByteDance claimed to have taken copyright management measures, a large number of infringing short videos were still appearing. Second, ByteDance did not deal with the allegedly infringing short videos in a timely manner. Therefore, judging from the actual effect of the measures taken by ByteDance, it did not meet the substantive requirements of effectively stopping and preventing obvious infringements, so its behavior could not be determined to have met the standard of “necessary measures.”"
Standardizing Platform Recommendations: It’s Not That Simple,"Caijing E-Law E, Chen Bing","Mar 24, 2022","If platforms are required to screen infringing works using a content comparison method, the main point is to distinguish between adaptations that require prior permission and legitimate use that does not. Current algorithm screening technology can only make judgments based on objective criteria and cannot adapt to specific scenarios which are flexible and changeable. It may not be able to filter out infringing content, and may even mistakenly filter out legitimate content. In iQIYI vs. ByteDance, the court held that even if algorithm recommendation technology could not identify the specific content of short videos, the platform should have taken measures related to how it defined the scope of algorithm-recommended content, how it set up and optimized the specific methods of algorithm recommendation, and how it included infringing content which had already entered the scope of recommendation in reviews so as to avoid its large-scale and long-term dissemination."
Standardizing Platform Recommendations: It’s Not That Simple,"Caijing E-Law E, Chen Bing","Mar 24, 2022","In practice, algorithm technology is already widely applied in business fields such as monitoring information suspected of infringement, sending infringement notifications, and disposing of suspected infringing information. Specifically, using algorithm technology to actively monitor and intercept information suspected of infringement has become the norm; copyright authorities have already implemented requirements for online platforms to actively monitor and intercept information suspected of infringement; and copyright monitoring and rights protection services using algorithm technology have become marketized service projects of considerable scale. In view of this, platforms have the basis for taking more active measures, so the corresponding scope and requirements of their duty of care also need to be adjusted with reference to developments in algorithm technology."
Standardizing Platform Recommendations: It’s Not That Simple,"Caijing E-Law E, Chen Bing","Mar 24, 2022","For example, platforms adopt shielding measures for infringing content that is actively filtered out by algorithms or through notification by the right holder in order to stop the same infringing content from being pushed again, which would result in repeated infringement and expanded damage. It can be considered that the increase in a platform’s duty of care will push it to actively improve its algorithm recommendation services’ compliance requirements and quality, and to take more active and effective measures to incorporate the costs of preventing infringement on the intellectual property rights of others into their overall operating cost considerations. This will be conducive to the stable and long-term development of the platform."
Standardizing Platform Recommendations: It’s Not That Simple,"Caijing E-Law E, Chen Bing","Mar 24, 2022","In fact, with the continuous rise in the economic status and importance of platforms, the content and extent of the duty of care that should be borne by platform operators are also expanding and strengthening. Therefore, our understanding and application of their “necessary measures” must also be constantly adjusted. This involves more than the expansion of normative interpretations of legal texts. We also need to weigh up our choices about what kind of attitude and model of thinking to apply. For example, further observation is needed to understand whether a theory of strict interpretation or a pragmatic application method is more conducive to the integration of the normative value and the application value of the law, to maintain the authority, feasibility, and accessibility of law."

For infringement that may be caused by algorithm recommendation service behavior, we must properly handle the relationship between incentivizing algorithm innovation and regulating the improper use of algorithms, and carry out governance on the premise of respecting the basic laws of algorithm operation and acknowledging the bounded rationality of algorithm technology cognition. That is, it is necessary to fully recognize the advantages and benefits of platforms’ use of algorithm technology, but also to be alert to the risks and harms of their misuse of algorithm technology."

Standardizing Platform Recommendations: It’s Not That Simple,"Caijing E-Law E, Chen Bing","Mar 24, 2022","For intellectual property infringement cases in algorithm recommendation, the Provisions introduce important ideas on adjusting the duty of care system. First, Article 12 of the Provisions is clear on encouraging algorithm recommendation service providers to optimize the degree of transparency and interpretability of rules used in retrieval, sorting, selection, push, and display. Article 24 clarifies the algorithm filing system. It requires algorithm recommendation service providers with public opinion attributes or social mobilization capabilities to submit information such as the service provider’s name, form of service, domain of application, algorithm type, algorithm self-assessment report, and content intended for public notification; to perform filing procedures; and to promptly complete modification procedures if the filed information changes."
Standardizing Platform Recommendations: It’s Not That Simple,"Caijing E-Law E, Chen Bing","Mar 24, 2022","In a narrow sense, we can think of algorithm transparency as meaning that algorithm programmers and implementers are obliged to disclose algorithm information. That is, they are required to publicly disclose, and report to the competent authorities, the code, data, decision trees, and other information on the algorithms they adopt. The establishment of an algorithm filing system and relevant rules for algorithm interpretation will help improve algorithm transparency, avoid the forming of “algorithm black boxes,” and avoid the use of algorithmic technologies suspected of infringing on intellectual property rights."
Standardizing Platform Recommendations: It’s Not That Simple,"Caijing E-Law E, Chen Bing","Mar 24, 2022","However, it remains to be seen how well this form of algorithmic disclosure actually works. This is because: first, even if information such as the operating principle of the algorithm is made public, it is still difficult for the public and other groups without specialized knowledge to truly understand an algorithm’s operating mechanism, much less detect whether there is a risk of infringement. Second, if the process of algorithm disclosure lacks comments, feedback, and supervision by relevant entities, the credibility of the disclosed information will also be questionable."

Article 5 of the Provisions clearly encourages relevant industry organizations to strengthen industry self-discipline, to establish and improve industry standards, industry guidelines, and self-discipline management systems, and to urge and guide algorithm recommendation service providers to formulate and improve service standards, provide services in accordance with the law, and accept social supervision. The problem of governing intellectual property infringement in algorithm recommendation services also requires joint consultation, co-construction, and co-governance by various entities such as platforms and industry associations."

Standardizing Platform Recommendations: It’s Not That Simple,"Caijing E-Law E, Chen Bing","Mar 24, 2022","While regulating platform algorithm recommendation service behavior, user rights to self-determination, such as freedom of data dissemination, freedom of sharing, and ability to choose cannot be ignored. In the “user chooses to share > platform pre-review > algorithm recommendation > user receives push content” process, platform pre-review is a decisive point in determining whether user-shared content can be pushed to more users through algorithm recommendation. Therefore, the platform needs to formulate complete pre-review standards and make them public for all platform users to view so that content can be shared after users have understood and agreed."
Standardizing Platform Recommendations: It’s Not That Simple,"Caijing E-Law E, Chen Bing","Mar 24, 2022","At this point, the platform and the user have actually reached an agreement, which should strictly abide by the provisions of Articles 496 and 497 on standard terms in the Civil Code. Platforms cannot excessively censor user-published content in order to reduce compliance costs and lessen their responsibilities. They cannot use standard terms or other such methods to restrict or exclude a user’s main rights, and they must fulfil the obligation to notify of restrictive terms that exceed a user’s reasonable expectations."
Standardizing Platform Recommendations: It’s Not That Simple,"Caijing E-Law E, Chen Bing","Mar 24, 2022","In the process from algorithm recommendation to the user’s receipt of pushed content, the platform’s review standards should also strive for precision.

This resulted in some users being unwilling to then go to iQIYI to pay to watch the episode. This situation infringed on iQIYI’s right to disseminate information on the internet and resulted in actual losses to the company. At the same time, some short videos only showed a part of the screen image. To some extent, this is reasonable use and does not constitute infringement. If the platform does not push the content which does not risk infringement, it will actually detract from the rights and interests of users and, in some cases, this is not conducive to the dissemination of works and there is a possibility of harming the interests of the copyright owner."

Strategies for Breaking Through China’s Energy Security Constraints Under the New Pattern,"Petroleum & Petrochemical Today , Fu Wenli","Jun 1, 2021","From the perspective of oil and gas resource supply in China, over the past 40 years of reform and opening, China’s economy has grown rapidly and has become the second-largest economy in the world. Coupled with the decline in domestic oil production in the past few years, China’s dependence on foreign oil has continued to rise. In 2017, it surpassed the United States to become the world’s largest crude oil importer. In 2020, China’s foreign dependence on crude oil reached 73%, and its dependence on foreign natural gas had also climbed to 43%. Judging from the data, China’s energy security issues seem to be more urgent and prominent. But from the perspective of global oil and gas resource supply, the current world oil and gas market is generally in sufficient supply, which is very much conducive to China making full use of the international market to expand resource channels. Since 2009, with the success of the “shale revolution” in the United States, the international oil situation has undergone fundamental changes. At the same time, with the continuous progress of exploration and development technology, especially after 2014, oil production in the United States, Norway, Brazil, and Canada has continued to grow, the oil market’s resource supply is sufficient and it is generally in a state of oversupply. In addition, technological advances have meant that resource supply is no longer the main issue for energy security. Tremendous progress in S&T makes the potential resources of energy supply very rich. According to BP’s forecast, by 2050, the world’s proven fossil fuel resource reserves will have increased from 2.9 trillion barrels of oil equivalent to between 4.6 trillion and 4.8 trillion barrels of oil equivalent, nearly doubling. Thus, before 2035, when China has achieved moderately prosperous society in all respects and the basic realization of socialist modernization, the international oil and gas supply situation which China faces should be relatively relaxed, with ample guarantees for diversified import sources. In addition, from the perspective of oil demand, due to the development of electric vehicles and hydrogen energy technology, the century-old trend of continuous and rapid increase in oil demand is now being reversed. It is expected that peak oil demand will be ushered in from 2025–2030, after which China’s dependence on foreign oil and gas will experience a declining trend. Based on a comprehensive judgment, China’s oil and gas resource supply risks will not become more and more urgent, but will rather become more and more relaxed as the oil peak approaches."

Strategies for Breaking Through China’s Energy Security Constraints Under the New Pattern,"Petroleum & Petrochemical Today , Fu Wenli","Jun 1, 2021","Throughout the century-old history of energy development, due to the scarcity of oil and gas resources, past geopolitical conflicts to a great degree stemmed from oil, which caused the market to rise and fall. For a China which is highly dependent on imports, high oil prices increase foreign exchange expenditures, driving a rise in the price of goods, reducing GDP growth, and negatively impacting economic development. From the perspective of the development trend of future geopolitical conflicts, things will still be very complicated and serious and even aggravated."
Strategies for Breaking Through China’s Energy Security Constraints Under the New Pattern,"Petroleum & Petrochemical Today , Fu Wenli","Jun 1, 2021","The United States’ “shale oil and gas revolution” has made the U.S. the world’s largest oil producer and net exporter. After 2020 it achieved full energy independence, and began pursuing the formation of a new “energy hegemony” on the global energy map. In recent years, it has often played its card of having the power to control energy, and it has continuously suppressed Iran’s crude oil exports, sanctioned Venezuela to reduce crude oil exports, and has threatened to sanction Russia and Germany’s natural gas pipeline projects, adding variables to the whole world’s energy trade and international cooperation. At the same time, the development of S&T has also made the geopolitical forms of conflict more sensitive, fragile, and unpredictable. For example, in 2019, under the “double insurance” offensive of Yemen’s Houthi armed drone fleet and cruise missiles, Saudi Arabia’s oil production capacity was instantly “chopped in half,” and the world’s output of refined oil fell by five percentage points. Fortunately, however, in the bigger context of increasingly loose oil and gas resources, the high sensitivity of oil prices to geopolitical conflicts has been greatly reduced. Generally, there will be no long-term fluctuations following geopolitical events, and the oil supply pattern and logic of oil price changes have been quietly changing. Therefore, it can be judged that regardless of future intensifications of geopolitical conflicts, the emergence of a large-scale global oil crisis like that of the 1990s is today almost impossible. Even if there were to be large-scale turmoil in the Middle East and direct conflict between world powers, oil prices could, over a short period, fluctuate sharply to a high of more than $100 but in the long run, the energy transition will bring downward pressure on oil and gas prices. It is expected that future oil prices will for a long time remain at a relatively stable level of $50~$70 per barrel, and there will not be a long-term risk of high oil prices which would have a negative impact on the Chinese economy."

Strategies for Breaking Through China’s Energy Security Constraints Under the New Pattern,"Petroleum & Petrochemical Today , Fu Wenli","Jun 1, 2021","With the intensification of maneuvering and conflicts between major powers, energy security and the environment for international cooperation deteriorate sharply. Even if future resource supply is relatively sufficient, it is necessary to fully estimate and prepare for the high degree of uncertainty in energy trade cooperation brought about by high geopolitical risks. It is estimated that the risks mainly come from several dimensions. First, the security risks of major international shipping channels are rising, and hidden dangers affecting strategic oil and gas channels are increasing. In particular, the security of China’s oil import transportation relies on sea transportation and the Malacca Strait waterway and oil and gas shipping companies fear sanctions, and their oil and gas transportation business in sensitive countries being restricted. Second, the risk of trade sanctions has increased. Due to the distribution of some oil and gas production in sensitive areas, Chinese energy companies may enter entity sanctions lists, and overseas fund settlement accounts may be frozen, hindering oil and gas trade with sanctioned countries. Third is the risk of international energy cooperation projects. In the context of intense great power maneuvering, due to the implementation of “long-arm jurisdiction” by the United States, some countries have a reduced willingness to cooperate in projects with China and may even refuse to do so, the introduction of key energy technologies and core oil and gas equipment faces blockages, and the “stranglehold” problem is becoming increasingly apparent. The United States and its allies are trying to obstruct the Belt and Road Initiative, and the energy cooperation projects which China and the resource countries along the Belt and Road have in place or have been negotiating will become more uncertain, and once shelved or canceled, initial investments will become sunk costs. Therefore, it is necessary to intensively establish bottom-line thinking and plan in advance for possible risks and coping strategies."

Strategies for Breaking Through China’s Energy Security Constraints Under the New Pattern,"Petroleum & Petrochemical Today , Fu Wenli","Jun 1, 2021","Since the beginning of the new century, the global energy pattern has been deeply adjusted, a new round of energy revolution has vigorously emerged, the speed of the transformation process has significantly increased, and energy production and consumption have continued to develop in a cleaner, more low-carbon, higher-efficiency, electrified, and intelligentized direction. Among these, “re-electrification” has already become the inevitable path for driving the rapid development of clean energy and realizing energy transformation. The global economy will be deeply decarbonized in everyday living and economic fields, and we must act, with traditional electrification as the foundation, to make full use of new energy, new materials, and digital technology, and pursue the large-scale development and utilization of clean energy and the replacement of fossil fuels to ultimately realize the complete electrification of industry, buildings, and transportation. According to BP’s forecast, by 2050, electricity will become the main energy carrier, increasing from 20% of current energy consumption to nearly 50%, and consumption will more than double. The energy supply system will be dominated by electricity. China is also striving to transform from an energy-intensive economy to a service-driven economy, gradually reducing the demand for coal and oil in end-use energy, and increasing the proportion of electricity consumption. The high degree of electrification of the end-use energy system will bring new structural risks to energy security, and shift the center of future energy security from the principally oil and gas-based system to the protection of the power system."

Strategies for Breaking Through China’s Energy Security Constraints Under the New Pattern,"Petroleum & Petrochemical Today , Fu Wenli","Jun 1, 2021","China is the world’s largest energy producer and consumer. How to ensure national energy security and guarantee economic and social development has always been the primary issue facing the development of the energy industry. In 2014, General Secretary Xi Jinping proposed the new strategy for energy security of “Four Revolutions, One Cooperation” (“四个革命、一个合作”)  revealing the characteristics, laws, and direction of China’s energy development in the new era. In the past few decades, China’s traditional energy security thinking has mainly focused on the preservation of oil and gas resources, with the main path being to increase domestic exploration and development and international resource cooperation. Under the new development pattern, China will continue to base its approach on its own endowment of energy resources, coordinate the energy transition requirements and follow the objective laws of the development of energy supply and demand, treat energy supply side structural reforms as the core thread, and continuously adjust and perfect the path for realizing energy security, using a multi-pronged approach to bring about a new-era energy security guarantee system under multiple goals."
Strategies for Breaking Through China’s Energy Security Constraints Under the New Pattern,"Petroleum & Petrochemical Today , Fu Wenli","Jun 1, 2021","2.1     Path 1: Unswervingly basing the approach on international and domestic resources, achieving energy security under open conditions"
Strategies for Breaking Through China’s Energy Security Constraints Under the New Pattern,"Petroleum & Petrochemical Today , Fu Wenli","Jun 1, 2021","Under the current complex and severe external development situation, to ensure national energy security, it is imperative that we treat the development and utilization of domestic oil and natural gas resources as the most fundamental foothold for solving oil security problems, and efforts must be made to continuously increase exploration and development and technological innovation. At the same time, we must vigorously promote the oil and gas marketization reform, cultivate a more dynamic oil and gas market, build a diversified supply system, and continuously improve the level of coal-fired oil and gas security. However, it should also be noted that in a country with a huge economy like China, in terms of domestic oil and gas production and reserves, it is far from enough to rely solely on domestic oil and gas supply. In particular, due to the limitations of China’s geological resource endowment, even with the recent increases in both domestic oil and gas reserves and exploitation, most of the achievements made in the reserves have been rolling increases of old oil fields and old oil layers; the number of discoveries of new layers, new blocks, and new resource types has been low. In addition, the grades of newly discovered reserves are not ideal, resulting in higher exploration and development costs. Preliminary estimates show that new oil and gas production during the 14th Five-Year Plan period still cannot keep up with demand growth, and China’s dependence on foreign oil and gas will continue to rise. Therefore, even under the new development pattern, for now and for a long time to come, we still need to unswervingly base our approach on both international and domestic resources, and continue to “go global” (走出去) participating in transnational energy cooperation, and vigorously promoting the internationalization of China’s petroleum industry. Under the Belt and Road strategy’s guidance, not only should state-owned enterprises go global but we should also encourage private enterprises to do so, to actively participate in the development and utilization of the world’s oil and gas resources and form strong international market competition and resource organization capabilities. At the same time, we must actively participate in, and even guide, the construction of the global energy governance system and deepen the implementation of the “international cooperation” in General Secretary Xi Jinping’s new-era energy security strategy to solve China’s energy security issues."
Strategies for Breaking Through China’s Energy Security Constraints Under the New Pattern,"Petroleum & Petrochemical Today , Fu Wenli","Jun 1, 2021","2.2     Path 2: Strengthen strategic reserves, boosting China’s energy emergency support capabilities"
Strategies for Breaking Through China’s Energy Security Constraints Under the New Pattern,"Petroleum & Petrochemical Today , Fu Wenli","Jun 1, 2021","In today’s world, “black swan” events are a common occurrence. Out of important considerations for the long-term development of national economic security, though overall energy supply is sufficient, in the broader context of more complex geopolitics, it is necessary to pay close attention to the possible interruption of energy channels that emergencies could bring and the subsequent problems this would bring of insufficient emergency energy reserves. The role of future strategic reserves in ensuring energy security is therefore more prominent. Compared with the urgency of demand, China’s oil reserves only began at the national level in 2004, and though in recent years China has attached great importance to strategic energy reserves and made many useful explorations, constrained by issues such as insufficient reserve space, outdated storage technology, and high storage costs, there is still a considerable gap to be made up between overall scale and the scale of Western developed countries’ strategic oil reserves. In recent years, international oil and gas prices have been relatively low, providing China with a good strategic reserve window, and we can seize this favorable opportunity to make good use of the low oil price cycle to increase imports and increase reserves. China should accelerate deployments for constructing reserve bases around important coastal ports and petrochemical industry bases and promote the linkage of four ports—seaports, dry ports, airports, and information ports—build a world-class port cluster, speed up the construction of storage and transportation facilities such as wharfs, pipeline networks, oil tanks, and oil and gas depots, and make full use of underground spaces such as salt mine caverns and underground water-sealed caverns, promoting energy infrastructure construction, innovating oil and gas storage models, and taking on global resources for the Asia-Pacific market. We should mobilize private capital to participate in oil reserves, encourage domestic and foreign enterprises, carry out commercial reserves of gasoline, diesel, and aviation kerosene in accordance with international standards,  and jointly build a reserve system which combines state reserves, commercial reserves, and social reserves, support the joint construction of oil storage and transportation bases with international oil-producing countries, accelerate the formation of an international oil product bonded delivery system, and thus build up a diversified crude oil reserve system in an all-round way."

Strategies for Breaking Through China’s Energy Security Constraints Under the New Pattern,"Petroleum & Petrochemical Today , Fu Wenli","Jun 1, 2021","For a long time, improving energy efficiency has been a priority in different countries’ energy strategies and policies. The major developed countries have all formulated mid- and long-term energy efficiency improvement goals and treated this as the basis for enhancing energy security, optimizing energy structure, and improving environmental quality. Socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era, and the principal contradiction in our society has shifted to the contradiction between the people’s ever-growing needs for a better life and unbalanced and inadequate development. With the rapid advancement of industrialization and urbanization, the people’s need for energy is increasing. In order for China to ensure both the quality of life of its people and the safety of national energy use, it needs to set about tackling two aspects: resource security and energy efficiency improvement. To a certain extent you could even say that energy saving and energy efficiency are the biggest “energy sources.” Taking transportation as an example, if we look at the data released for the energy-saving and new energy vehicle technology roadmap, fuel consumption per 100 kilometers has been reduced from 5.0 liters in 2020 to about 3.2 liters. By 2050, the contribution rate of fuel saving in China’s transportation sector will reach 240 million tons, which will greatly weaken the driving force of the increase in car ownership to oil consumption, and the fuel saving effect will be very significant. Therefore, in future, China needs to vigorously promote energy-saving transformation in key sectors and promote all-round energy efficiency improvement, using this to drive economic structural adjustments and industrial transformation and upgrading, promote a green lifestyle and consumer culture, release the huge potential contained in energy efficiency, and play a huge role in guaranteeing national energy security."

Strategies for Breaking Through China’s Energy Security Constraints Under the New Pattern,"Petroleum & Petrochemical Today , Fu Wenli","Jun 1, 2021","The current state of energy resources and the environment, and the level of global carbon dioxide emissions, show that it is impossible for developing countries to follow the traditional model used by Western developed countries of high consumption and high pollution in the industrialization process. We must develop a green energy path that supports a better life with lower energy intensity and cleaner energy. In China’s current energy mix, coal accounts for about 58%. Under the 30·60 goal, China’s future energy consumption cannot possibly continue to maintain a high proportion of coal consumption, while oil and natural gas consumption are constrained by insufficient domestic resources. Therefore, for China, the development of new energy has become the ultimate solution to China’s energy security problems. This is not only a practical need for changing the development model of China’s long-term over-reliance on fossil fuel resource consumption. It is aimed at the future two major competitive fields of global energy resources and technological innovation, and will enhance China’s global discourse power and global influence on carbon reduction, as a strategic move which reflects the responsibility-shouldering of a major country. At the same time, compared with other countries, China has unique advantages in the development of new energy. It has already established a complete production chain in the wind power and photovoltaic power generation field, China’s technology research and development, equipment manufacturing, construction and operation and so on are all world leading. All of this is very much conducive, in the new development pattern, to China more quickly and effectively transforming industrial advantages into economic advantages, S&T innovation advantages, and green development advantages. In the future, our country can regard “renewable energy + water electrolysis for hydrogen production” as an ideal solution for China’s energy security."

Strategies for Breaking Through China’s Energy Security Constraints Under the New Pattern,"Petroleum & Petrochemical Today , Fu Wenli","Jun 1, 2021","Electrification as a feature of future global terminal energy consumption is striking. China’s energy industry should continue to thoroughly implement the new energy security strategy during the 14th Five-Year Plan period and for a longer period beyond. China will also speed up the process of “electrification” and move from a big electric power country (电力大国) to a strong electric power country (电力强国), and international energy cooperation may also expand from primary to secondary energy. At present, globally, there are still about 1 billion people for whom the problem of electricity consumption has yet to be fully solved. China should fully grasp the new trends and changes in international energy cooperation, carry out in-depth Belt and Road energy cooperation, and expand the breadth and depth of Belt and Road energy cooperation, strengthen the interconnectivity of electricity and other infrastructure, and deepen cooperation in advanced technology fields such as high-efficiency and low-cost new energy power generation and clean and efficient coal-fired power generation. China should also actively participate in global energy governance, giving impetus to the construction of new global energy governance mechanisms and autonomous and controllable global energy supply chains, providing Chinese solutions for, and contributing Chinese wisdom towards, building an open, competitive, efficient, and stable energy market and a more orderly and inclusive global energy governance structure."

Strategies for Breaking Through China’s Energy Security Constraints Under the New Pattern,"Petroleum & Petrochemical Today , Fu Wenli","Jun 1, 2021","Oil, as a special commodity, has experienced a long evolution and maneuvering in the development of its pricing power. In the game of commodity currency pricing power, which includes oil, the U.S. dollar not only gained principal influence in the pricing of the world oil futures market but it has at the same time also enabled the United States to influence to the greatest extent the fluctuation of international oil prices, to meet its national interests and to meet the goals of domestic economic operation. The launch of China’s crude oil futures in 2018 explores a new path for China to maintain national energy security. This will reduce the risk of single petrodollar pricing and will help to improve China’s ability to deal with the risk of oil price fluctuations in the international market. It will help us to break through the “Asian premium” that exists in Middle East crude oil, safeguarding China’s energy security. It will also help to enhance China’s influence in Asia, aiding the internationalization of the RMB. Over the past two years, RMB crude oil futures have been running smoothly, with trading volume, open interest and delivery volume rapidly increasing, and market influence has constantly grown, making China the third largest crude oil futures market in the world. In the future, against the backdrop of the gradual opening of China’s financial market and capital accounts, the internationalization of the RMB, and the return of overseas funds to China, the development of RMB crude oil futures will usher in a historical window as the conditions for realizing the pricing power of a petro-RMB are maturing. China should further reflect fully on the management experience of developed countries’ oil futures markets, take into account the reality in China, improve the investor structure, accelerate the establishment of an international platform for oil futures trading, improve the regulatory measures supporting oil futures, and actively and steadily promote the development of the internationalization of the RMB with petro-RMB, building a new order of global energy governance."

The Global Development Initiative upholds the notion of the people as central, and is dedicated to joining hands in building a global development community. Its aim is to inject important impetus into accelerating implementation of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and promoting the sustainable growth of the global economy. The Global Security Initiative is guided by a concept of security that is shared, comprehensive, cooperative, and sustainable, with mutual respect as the basic precept, the indivisibility of security as an important principle, and building a security community as the long-term goal. It points to a new type of security path of dialogue rather than conflict, forming partnerships rather than alliances, and win-win rather than zero-sum outcomes. Each of these two initiatives has its own focus and promotes the other. Security is a prerequisite for development, development is the basis for security, and integrating development and security is the only way to achieve lasting peace and common prosperity."
"Strengthen Solidarity and Cooperation, Improve Global Governance — Video Address by Wang Yi at the Opening of the China-Russia High-level Think Tank Forum","Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Wang Yi","Jun 1, 2022","There is a Russian proverb that says, “When streams combine they become a river, and when people gather they become a force.” The Chinese also like to say that “when many people gather wood, the fire blazes high.” Building and improving global governance depends on joint consultations, joint contributions, and shared benefits.

"Strengthen Solidarity and Cooperation, Improve Global Governance — Video Address by Wang Yi at the Opening of the China-Russia High-level Think Tank Forum","Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Wang Yi","Jun 1, 2022","The first is to promote a concept of democracy that puts the people first and is open and inclusive. Democracy is a common value of all humankind, not the exclusive preserve of a few countries. Nowhere in the world is there a universally applicable democratic formula, nor is there a model of democracy that is superior to others. Monopolizing the definition of democracy, imposing one’s values, and interfering in the internal affairs of other countries under the guise of democracy and human rights, are unpopular and will not succeed. China is ready to work with the Russian side and the international community to promote true democracy that is in line with the national conditions and popular will of each country."
"Strengthen Solidarity and Cooperation, Improve Global Governance — Video Address by Wang Yi at the Opening of the China-Russia High-level Think Tank Forum","Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Wang Yi","Jun 1, 2022","The second is to adhere to a concept of development that is balanced and coordinated, inclusive and win-win. We should work with emerging market countries and the numerous developing countries to jointly safeguard the legitimate development rights of all countries. We should continue to expand cooperation in key areas such as poverty reduction, food security, anti-epidemic measures, development financing, climate change, green and sustainable development, industrialization, the digital economy, and connectivity, and build a broad development partnership to help the global post-pandemic recovery and achieve stronger, greener, and healthier development."
"Strengthen Solidarity and Cooperation, Improve Global Governance — Video Address by Wang Yi at the Opening of the China-Russia High-level Think Tank Forum","Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Wang Yi","Jun 1, 2022","The third is to uphold a concept of security that is shared, comprehensive, cooperative, and sustainable. The human community shares a common destiny, and global security is indivisible. No country can or should seek its own absolute security at the expense of harming the security of other countries. International and regional security cannot and should not be assured by strengthening military groups, manufacturing ideological iron curtains, or cutting production chain supply chains. Only by steadfastly pursuing the notions of both-win and win-win, and taking into account the security of other countries when pursuing one’s own security can we forge a path of mutually beneficial win-win security and truly form a security community for humankind."
"Strengthen Solidarity and Cooperation, Improve Global Governance — Video Address by Wang Yi at the Opening of the China-Russia High-level Think Tank Forum","Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Wang Yi","Jun 1, 2022","The fourth is to put into practice the concept of an order based on equality and respect, solidarity and cooperation. Chairman Xi Jinping has pointed out that the world’s many countries are all on board a great ship with a common destiny.

The global governance system should be a more balanced reflection of the will and interests of the majority of countries, especially emerging market countries and developing countries in general. Russia and China should continue to work together with peace-loving and development-oriented countries; resolutely uphold the international system with the United Nations at its core and the international order based on international law; continuously promote the democratization of international relations; and contribute to the common development, sustainable prosperity, and long-term peace and security of human society."

Strengthening Crisis Management is the Top Priority in Current China-U.S. and China-Japan Security Relations,"China International Strategy Review , Zhang Tuosheng","Dec 31, 2021","At present, the greatest security risk between China and the United States lies in the Taiwan Strait. This is not only because cross-Strait relations have deteriorated again since 2016, and the views of China and the United States on the DPP Tsai Ing-wen regime are severely opposed, but also because the United States has been playing the “Taiwan card” to exert pressure on China. Under this situation, the situation in the Taiwan Strait has entered the most dangerous moment since the end of the Cold War. In the past three years, PLA military planes and warships have repeatedly flown and sailed around the island of Taiwan to implement military deterrence against “Taiwan independence” and external interfering forces. With the obvious intensification of military operations between China and the United States in the Taiwan Strait, the possibility of a military crisis or military conflict in the Taiwan Strait due to misjudgment or miscalculation has risen sharply. The bigger risk is that if the “Taiwan independence” forces and foreign intervening forces openly cross the red line set by China’s Anti-Secession Law, China will be forced to use non-peaceful means, including military means, to fight against separatism.

Former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement on the South China Sea in 2019, completely denying China’s claims to sovereignty and rights and interests in the South China Sea, in an attempt to intensify maritime disputes between China and relevant countries in the South China Sea and undermine the negotiation between China and ASEAN countries to establish the South China Sea code of conduct and joint efforts to maintain stability in the South China Sea. Under this severe situation, the PLA has vigorously strengthened the surveillance and expulsion of U.S. ships and aircraft that conduct close-in reconnaissance and FONOPs in the South China Sea and has conducted more military exercises, including missile test launches, in the South China Sea."

Since the China-U.S. relationship was mainly based on contact and cooperation at that time, and both sides paid attention to the overall situation of the relationship between the two countries, the three crises were relieved relatively quickly. In the period after 2012, with the escalation of the North Korean nuclear crisis and the maritime crises between China, Japan, and the Philippines, the risk of China and the United States being involved in crises and conflicts due to third-party factors has increased significantly but the risk of a direct military crisis between the two countries is small. However, the current situation has changed significantly. China-U.S. relations have changed from a “cooperation-competition” relationship to a seriously unbalanced “competition-cooperation” relationship. Even in the “strategic competition relationship,” confrontation factors between the two countries have increased significantly. Military and security frictions between the two sides continue to intensify, military dialogues and exchanges are rapidly declining, and the security relationship is seriously deteriorating. Under such circumstances, if China-U.S. military security frictions trigger a military crisis, the risk of a military conflict will be greatly increased, and crisis management will be much more difficult than in the past. Moreover, once the military crisis gets out of control, a military conflict may quickly plunge China-U.S. relations into the abyss of a “new cold war.”"

This is the effort made by the Chinese and American militaries to maintain the bottom line of “no conflict and no confrontation” between the two sides. As of 2019, the militaries of the two countries still maintain a number of dialogues and exchanges, such as the China-U.S. maritime military security consultation, the China-U.S. Asia-Pacific security dialogue, and the China-U.S. Defense Policy Coordination Talks (DPCT)."

During the call, the two sides had serious opposing positions, but both stated that they would maintain communication and consultation and strengthen risk and crisis management.

In late July, Japanese media claimed that Japan had found a Chinese official ship in the area adjacent to the Diaoyu Islands for 100 consecutive days, setting a record for the longest consecutive days since September 2012.

These disputes include territorial sovereignty disputes over the ownership of the Diaoyu Islands, delimitation of the East China Sea Exclusive Economic Zone and resource disputes, the air game formed by the large overlap of the air defense identification zones of the two countries, the friction between the Chinese navy and air force entering the Western Pacific through the international channel of the Japanese archipelago and the Japan Sea and Air Self-Defense Force, as well as the disputes and frictions between the two sides on the South China Sea issue.

After the two Diaoyu Islands crises in 2010 and 2012, Japan began to clearly regard China as a major security threat, and the deployment of troops accelerated from north to southwest; China also vigorously strengthened preparations for military confrontation in the East China Sea. Over the years, the military confrontation between China and Japan has been fully reflected in defense policies, defense budgets, and military deployments of the two countries. In addition, the two sides still have “strategic mutual doubts,” and the military confrontation between China and Japan will be difficult to swiftly resolve despite the improvement of the overall relationship between the two countries."

For a long time, Japan has always had strong pro-Taiwan forces, and the Taiwan issue has always been one of the three points of friction between China and Japan. In recent years, as the situation in the Taiwan Strait has worsened and become increasingly tense, the possibility of a military crisis or even a military conflict between China and the United States in the Taiwan Strait has continued to rise. As the main military ally of the United States in the Asia-Pacific region, Japan is likely to be involved in the Taiwan Strait crisis or even a military conflict in the Taiwan Strait."
Strengthening Crisis Management is the Top Priority in Current China-U.S. and China-Japan Security Relations,"China International Strategy Review , Zhang Tuosheng","Dec 31, 2021","Finally, the trend of Japan and the United States to continue to strengthen military alliances and cooperation will further increase the security friction between China and Japan. In January 2019, Japan officially decided to introduce two land-based Aegis Combat Systems from the United States. In April of the same year, Japan and the United States confirmed that they would strengthen cooperation in outer space and cyber security and confirmed that Article 5 of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty applies to the space and cyber fields. In 2019, after the United States withdrew from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, it proposed to deploy intermediate-range missiles in East Asia, which is different from the attitude of South Korea, the Philippines, and Australia, which refused to deploy. Japan was ambiguous on this. In June 2020, due to technical and cost considerations, the Japanese government decided to abandon the deployment plan of the ground-based Aegis anti-missile system, but immediately began to discuss whether Japan should have the ability to attack enemy bases. Under such circumstances, senior U.S. officials publicly suggested that Japan would be a candidate for the United States to deploy an intermediate-range missile system in Asia. In August of the same year, Japanese media reported that Japan and the United States would further develop a joint anti-missile system and jointly build a defense network for missile detection and tracking consisting of thousands of small satellites. These small satellites would run in low orbits 300-1000 kilometers from the ground. In the next two years, if Japan agrees to U.S. deployment of a ground-based intermediate missile system on its territory and to further strengthen Japan-U.S. anti-missile cooperation, it will surely bring new serious troubles and challenges to China-Japan security relations."

Under this situation, strengthening crisis management, especially crisis prevention, must be the top priority in China-Japan security relations. Otherwise, even if the two countries face major challenges such as the Taiwan Strait crisis, and even if the two sides have unexpected incidents at sea, the atmosphere for the improvement of China-Japan relations may be quickly reversed, and the development of bilateral relations will once again face serious setbacks."

At present, after several rounds of consultations between the defense departments of the two countries, positive progress has been made on the direct telephone connection between the maritime and air liaison mechanism, and the construction is expected to start as soon as possible. Affected by the pandemic, the follow-up specific arrangements have been delayed. In addition, the author believes that the defense agencies of both sides still lack mutual trust and a lack of awareness of crisis management."

The dialogue mechanisms established by the two sides include: China-Japan Security Dialogue (1993-2019), China-Japan Defense Consultation (1997-2011), China-Japan Consultation on East China Sea Issue (2004-2008), China-Japan Strategic Dialogue (2005-2019), China-Japan High-level Consultation on Maritime Affairs (2012-present), and China-Japan High-level Political Consultation (2014-present)."

After the second Diaoyu Islands incident broke out in 2012, all dialogues were interrupted for a long time. During this period, the friction and confrontation between the two sides became more serious, misunderstandings and suspicions continued to intensify, and the risk of crisis continued to rise."
Strengthening Crisis Management is the Top Priority in Current China-U.S. and China-Japan Security Relations,"China International Strategy Review , Zhang Tuosheng","Dec 31, 2021","By 2019, with the warming of China-Japan relations, the China-Japan security and defense dialogues have been basically restored and developed.

However, in recent years, the Track 2 dialogues held by think tanks in China and Japan have developed rapidly, and their influence on the decision-making of the two governments has increased."
Strengthening Crisis Management is the Top Priority in Current China-U.S. and China-Japan Security Relations,"China International Strategy Review , Zhang Tuosheng","Dec 31, 2021","Unfortunately, the mechanism for China-Japan defense and security dialogues in 2020 has generally stalled. This stagnation, however, is not due to a new crisis between the two countries; it is due to the restrictions on international exchanges brought about by the outbreak of the global pandemic. In the face of the raging COVID-19 pandemic, China and Japan have carried out certain forms of cooperation in the fight against the pandemic and have always maintained communication between their foreign affairs agencies. This will help the two sides resume dialogues after the pandemic eases."
Strengthening Crisis Management is the Top Priority in Current China-U.S. and China-Japan Security Relations,"China International Strategy Review , Zhang Tuosheng","Dec 31, 2021","To sum up, by comparing crisis management awareness, crisis management mechanism construction, and security and defense dialogues between China and the United States and China and Japan, three basic views can be drawn."
Strengthening Crisis Management is the Top Priority in Current China-U.S. and China-Japan Security Relations,"China International Strategy Review , Zhang Tuosheng","Dec 31, 2021","First, in terms of crisis management awareness, for a long time, the United States has been stronger than China and Japan, which is related to its experience of fierce confrontation with the Soviet Union in the Cold War; the crisis management awareness between China and the United States is stronger than that between China and Japan, which is mainly determined by the different experiences of China-U.S. and China-Japan security relations after the war and at the beginning of the end of the Cold War. In recent years, after years of a state of crisis, the awareness of crisis management between China and Japan has been greatly improved, which will help both countries to strengthen crisis management in the future."
Strengthening Crisis Management is the Top Priority in Current China-U.S. and China-Japan Security Relations,"China International Strategy Review , Zhang Tuosheng","Dec 31, 2021","Second, in the construction of a bilateral crisis management mechanism, the mechanism construction between China and the United States and between China and Japan must be vigorously strengthened and improved. In comparison, the crisis management mechanism between China and the United States is significantly stronger than that between China and Japan. Before the serious deterioration of the relationship between the two countries, the establishment of the bilateral crisis management mechanism between China and the United States had made some progress. However, it was not until the power transfer between the two countries and the sharp rise in disputes between the two countries that the construction of the bilateral crisis management mechanism between China and Japan started slowly, and therefore faltered and progressed slowly. In the future, in the construction of crisis management mechanisms, China and the United States should focus on implementing, enriching, and improving relevant mechanisms, while China and Japan must redouble their efforts to change the serious lack of bilateral mechanisms."
Strengthening Crisis Management is the Top Priority in Current China-U.S. and China-Japan Security Relations,"China International Strategy Review , Zhang Tuosheng","Dec 31, 2021","Third, since the end of the Cold War, China and the United States and China and Japan have made great progress in establishing a mechanism for security and defense dialogues. The main problem with the two is that the dialogues are intermittent and less continuous. This is particularly evident between China and Japan. China and Japan have long lagged behind China and the United States in conducting Track 2 dialogues. However, in recent years, China-U.S. and China-Japan dialogues have shown different development trends. The China-Japan security and defense dialogues have gradually resumed and strengthened, while the China-U.S. security and defense dialogues have become increasingly stagnant. The former is beneficial for China and Japan to strengthen crisis management mechanism construction and carry out crisis management; the latter increases the difficulty for China and the United States to improve the crisis management mechanism and carry out crisis management."

Strengthening Crisis Management is the Top Priority in Current China-U.S. and China-Japan Security Relations,"China International Strategy Review , Zhang Tuosheng","Dec 31, 2021","There are three common suggestions: First, China, the United States, and Japan must further strengthen their awareness of crisis management and fully realize that in the new international situation, major powers must no longer resort to military conflicts and wars to resolve disputes; otherwise, there will be endless troubles. Second, in the face of the rising military security friction between the two sides, both China and the United States and China and Japan must vigorously strengthen and improve the construction of bilateral crisis management mechanisms. Third, both China and the United States and China and Japan must adopt a combination of online (internet) and offline (on-site) methods to resume security and defense dialogues as soon as possible in a focused and selective manner."
Strengthening Crisis Management is the Top Priority in Current China-U.S. and China-Japan Security Relations,"China International Strategy Review , Zhang Tuosheng","Dec 31, 2021","Below, we propose some specific suggestions for China and the United States and China and Japan to strengthen crisis management."
Strengthening Crisis Management is the Top Priority in Current China-U.S. and China-Japan Security Relations,"China International Strategy Review , Zhang Tuosheng","Dec 31, 2021",(i) Suggestions for Strengthening China-U.S. Crisis Management
Strengthening Crisis Management is the Top Priority in Current China-U.S. and China-Japan Security Relations,"China International Strategy Review , Zhang Tuosheng","Dec 31, 2021","In the current and foreseeable future, the focus of China-U.S. crisis management should be placed on the Taiwan Strait, the South China Sea, the Korean Peninsula, and cyberspace. Specifically, the South China Sea and cybersecurity frictions are new challenges faced by China and the United States in the past decade. While strengthening crisis management measures, it is necessary to clarify each other’s bottom lines as soon as possible. On the issue of the Taiwan Strait and the peninsula, after a long period of confrontation, the bottom line of both China and the United States is relatively clear. The key to avoiding the crisis is to never challenge the bottom line of the other side. In the long run, the East China Sea and outer space should also be important areas for both sides to strengthen crisis management."
Strengthening Crisis Management is the Top Priority in Current China-U.S. and China-Japan Security Relations,"China International Strategy Review , Zhang Tuosheng","Dec 31, 2021","At present, China and the United States should redouble their efforts to prevent maritime and air incidents due to misunderstandings and misjudgments or miscalculations. The two sides must effectively strengthen maritime military security consultation mechanisms. They must consciously and strictly abide by the code of conduct for the safety of maritime and air encounters and the mutual notification mechanism for major military operations jointly formulated by the two sides and their two annexes. In practice, its content must be constantly enriched and improved. To this end, in addition to insisting on holding annual situation and risk review meetings, relevant authorities on both sides must strengthen periodic and ad hoc consultations to eliminate hidden dangers in a timely manner and strive to keep security risks to a minimum."
Strengthening Crisis Management is the Top Priority in Current China-U.S. and China-Japan Security Relations,"China International Strategy Review , Zhang Tuosheng","Dec 31, 2021","In their efforts to resume and strengthen security and defense dialogues, China and the United States should make crisis management an important part of the dialogues. To this end, conditions should be jointly created, first of all, to resume the China-U.S. Diplomatic and Security Dialog (or China-U.S. Defense Consultation), the China-U.S. Joint Staff Dialog, the China-U.S. Maritime Military Security Consultation Annual Meeting, and the China-U.S. Law Enforcement and Cybersecurity Dialog. These dialogues should include the establishment and improvement of bilateral crisis communication mechanisms, various security confidence measures (including codes of conduct in maritime and air, cyberspace, and outer space), and how to avoid “militarization of the South China Sea.” In addition, the two sides should strive to launch the China-U.S. strategic stability dialogue at an early date. While focusing on the nuclear strategy, nuclear development strategy and related issues of cyber security, outer space security, anti-missile deployment, and development of new conventional strategic weapons, crisis stabilization, and the development of confidence measures in the nuclear field are also important components of the dialogue."
Strengthening Crisis Management is the Top Priority in Current China-U.S. and China-Japan Security Relations,"China International Strategy Review , Zhang Tuosheng","Dec 31, 2021","China and the United States should clarify and strengthen the crisis management function of the hotline of the two heads of state and the hotline of the defense agencies to ensure that the hotlines play an important role in crisis prevention and control. To this end, the frequency of dialogue should be increased, the appointment time should be shortened, and the hotline should be used to quickly exchange information, clarify intentions, and send clear signals. In order to establish crisis communication more quickly, the two sides should also seriously consider the issue of establishing military hotlines between the relevant theaters of the two countries. The various hotlines can be available at normal times, but their functionality in a crisis is key."
Strengthening Crisis Management is the Top Priority in Current China-U.S. and China-Japan Security Relations,"China International Strategy Review , Zhang Tuosheng","Dec 31, 2021","In addition to various hotline communication mechanisms, the two sides should also fully implement the role of the embassies and special envoys of the two sides for emergency communication. In addition, the two sides should set up a joint working group to deal with emergencies as soon as possible. Its main functions should include collecting and sharing risk information, discussing crisis prevention, controlling contingency plans, conducting crisis communication, and making recommendations to decision-makers before incidents. After incidents, they should conduct joint evaluations and summarizations of lessons learned. The joint working group can be set up under the diplomatic and security dialogues mechanism of the two countries and can be subject to the direct leadership of the diplomatic and military departments of the two countries."
Strengthening Crisis Management is the Top Priority in Current China-U.S. and China-Japan Security Relations,"China International Strategy Review , Zhang Tuosheng","Dec 31, 2021","Senior leaders of China and the United States and the two militaries should reach a consensus on the basic principles of crisis management. In China-U.S. security crisis management Track 2 dialogues, experts from both sides have jointly put forward several basic principles of crisis management, such as “always keeping direct communication channels open and sending clear and specific signals,” “escalating slowly and making symmetrical responses,” “working towards interests rather than from ideologies,” “using high-pressure methods with caution and preventing the promise trap,” “breaking difficult disputes into easier solutions and solving them gradually.” If these basic principles of crisis management can become the consensus of the high level of the two countries, it will be of great significance to strengthen the crisis management between China and the United States."
Strengthening Crisis Management is the Top Priority in Current China-U.S. and China-Japan Security Relations,"China International Strategy Review , Zhang Tuosheng","Dec 31, 2021","China and the United States should continue to support Track 2 security dialogues. Over the years, as a supplement to government dialogues, Track 2 security dialogues held by think tanks of the two countries have played a positive role in the two sides’ cooperation on security, managing differences and crises, reducing misunderstandings and misjudgments, and increasing mutual trust. Given that current security and defense dialogues between the two governments face serious difficulties, various Track 2 security dialogues, including the China-U.S. Security Dialogue, China-U.S. Strategic Nuclear Dialogue, China-U.S. Security Crisis Management Dialogue, and China-U.S. Cyber Security Dialogue, should not be suspended but should be further strengthened."

At present, an urgent task is to establish a defense hotline as soon as possible. In order to break the two-year deadlock on this issue, it is recommended that high-level leaders of the two countries jointly promote the matter and require that the defense authorities of both countries complete the task within a time limit."
Strengthening Crisis Management is the Top Priority in Current China-U.S. and China-Japan Security Relations,"China International Strategy Review , Zhang Tuosheng","Dec 31, 2021","Both China and Japan should seize the opportunity to improve the overall relationship and make up for the shortcomings of the bilateral crisis management mechanism as soon as possible. The two sides should strive to first reach an agreement on the establishment of a direct hotline between the top leaders of the two countries or the reactivation of the hotline between the two governments. Secondly, they can learn from the practices between China and the United States and conduct consultations on the development of a code of conduct for China-Japan maritime and air security and a mechanism for mutual notification of major military operations. In addition, the two sides should establish a liaison mechanism and code of conduct between the maritime law enforcement agencies of the two countries as soon as possible."
Strengthening Crisis Management is the Top Priority in Current China-U.S. and China-Japan Security Relations,"China International Strategy Review , Zhang Tuosheng","Dec 31, 2021","China and Japan should continue to resume and strengthen bilateral security and defense dialogues. First of all, annual defense and security consultations at the vice-ministerial level between China and Japan that have been stalled for many years should be restarted. The two countries should elevate the level of dialogue and exchanges between the defense agencies of the two countries and actively work to gradually change the military confrontation between the two countries and develop non-traditional security cooperation. This dialogue can also incorporate security issues such as cyber and outer space. Second, efforts should be made to resume consultations on the East China Sea issue at an early date and make efforts to gradually resolve the China-Japan border demarcation dispute through negotiations. Finally, the two sides should consider giving more crisis management functions to the high-level political consultations between China and Japan. In the future, the above-mentioned three dialogues will continue to be carried out together with the China-Japan Security Dialogue, the China-Japan High-level Consultation on Maritime Affairs, and the Annual Maritime and Air Liaison Mechanism Meeting, which will form an important guarantee for strengthening China-Japan crisis management."
Strengthening Crisis Management is the Top Priority in Current China-U.S. and China-Japan Security Relations,"China International Strategy Review , Zhang Tuosheng","Dec 31, 2021","China and Japan should form positive interactions to jointly maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. On the Taiwan issue, China adheres to the policy of “peaceful reunification and one country, two systems.” Japan abides by the “one-China policy” established when it resumed diplomatic relations with China and its commitment not to develop any official relations with the Taiwan region. On the South China Sea issue, China supports all countries, including Japan, to jointly maintain the safety and smoothness of maritime passages in the South China Sea. Japan supports the “dual-track approach” proposed by China and endorsed by ASEAN countries to resolve the South China Sea issue. If China and Japan can form the above-mentioned positive interaction, it will fundamentally prevent the two sides from crises and conflicts in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea."
Strengthening Crisis Management is the Top Priority in Current China-U.S. and China-Japan Security Relations,"China International Strategy Review , Zhang Tuosheng","Dec 31, 2021","China and Japan should also consider jointly promoting the trilateral security dialogue between China, Japan, and the United States at an appropriate time to discuss the many security issues which involve all three states. The main tasks of the dialogue are to formulate confidence-building measures (CBM) in military and security, reduce misunderstandings and miscalculations, manage differences and crises, and strengthen non-traditional security cooperation. This is of very positive significance for strengthening the crisis management between China and Japan and between China and the United States and in breaking the long-term confrontation between China and Japan and the United States in the bilateral military alliance."
Strengthening Crisis Management is the Top Priority in Current China-U.S. and China-Japan Security Relations,"China International Strategy Review , Zhang Tuosheng","Dec 31, 2021","China and Japan should vigorously develop and strengthen Track 2 security dialogues. Specifically, the China-Japan Crisis Management Dialogue, which has been carried out for several years, should receive more attention from relevant authorities on both sides, making it truly an important platform for exploring and strengthening China-Japan crisis management. In addition, while continuing to carry out existing Track 2 security dialogues, think tanks of the two countries should also establish new Track 2 dialogues on cyber security and outer space security, with emphasis placed on the management of differences and crisis management. In the future, some Track 2 dialogues can be upgraded to Track 1 dialogues."

Under this scenario, the China-U.S. relationship, which has seriously deteriorated, will inevitably move towards a full-scale confrontation and a cold war; the China-Japan relationship, which has gradually recovered and improved in recent years, may once again deviate from the normal development track and become tense and confrontational once again."
Strengthening Crisis Management is the Top Priority in Current China-U.S. and China-Japan Security Relations,"China International Strategy Review , Zhang Tuosheng","Dec 31, 2021","Second, through effective crisis management, the security frictions between the two sides can be controlled, major military crises and conflicts can be avoided, security risks for the two sides can be gradually reduced, and security relations can be gradually stabilized.

Based on the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation, we must accurately grasp the historical trend, effectively manage the complex situation in the Taiwan Strait, firmly grasp the dominance and initiative in cross-Strait relations, and lead the development of cross-Strait relations in the right direction. We must promote the realization of the first meeting and direct dialog and communication between leaders of the two sides since 1949, making a historic breakthrough and setting a new milestone. We must adhere to the one-China principle and the 1992 Consensus and take important steps to promote dialog and consultation from all walks of life on both sides of the Strait. Adhering to the concept of “Both Sides of the Taiwan Strait as One Family,” we will continue to deepen the integration and development of the two sides of the Strait, continue to improve the well-being of compatriots in Taiwan, and broadly gather the mighty forces that will jointly move towards peaceful reunification.

Why is political security the foundation of national security?,People's Daily,"Sep 14, 2021","In December 2010, large-scale anti-government demonstrations broke out in many places in Tunisia, and a great many people took to the streets, eventually forcing the then President Ben Ali to step down. The turbulent wave of the so-called Arab Spring immediately swept across more than 10 countries in the Middle East and North Africa, and many regimes collapsed. The reasons for this were very complicated, but fragile political security and vulnerability to manipulation and subversion by external forces was an important factor. Today, the Arab Spring has already turned into an Arab Winter. Not only has it failed to bring about the “democratic freedom” that the people had hoped for, but instead it has led to fragmented sovereignty, social disorder, economic stagnation, and people’s misery. Iron-clad facts tell us that political security is the foundation of national security. Without political security, there would be no national security of which to speak."
Study Q&A | 83. Why is political security the foundation of national security?,People's Daily,"Sep 14, 2021","General Secretary Xi Jinping points out that political security involves the stability of national sovereignty, political power, systems, and ideology; is the most fundamental need of a country and is the basic condition for the survival and development of all countries. If a country cannot be independent externally and has political turmoil internally, it is impossible for it to safeguard its own interests and achieve long-term development. The core of political security is regime security and system security. China is a socialist country led by the Chinese Communist Party. The most fundamental thing to safeguarding political security is safeguarding the leadership and governing status of the Chinese Communist Party and safeguarding the socialist system with Chinese characteristics. Only by unswervingly safeguarding political security can we better safeguard national interests and realize the Party’s long-term governance, the country’s enduring peace and stability, and the people’s peace and contentment in life and work. Political security is directly connected to the life and death of the Party and country. In the body of national security, political security is the heart. When the heart stops beating, no matter the strength of the body, its vitality will be lost. Since the founding of New China, the new socialist regime has been under the blockade and containment of hostile forces, and the contest between the two ideologies and systems of socialism and capitalism has never stopped. Right up until now, all kinds of hostile forces have never stopped implementing Westernization and differentiation strategies against China, have never stopped carrying out subverting and sabotaging activities towards the leadership of the CCP and China’s socialist system, and have relentlessly attempted to devise “color revolutions” within China. General Secretary Xi Jinping alerts the entire Party: “If one day a complex situation like a ‘color revolution’ were to occur before our eyes, would our cadres all be able to stand up resolutely to defend the Party’s leadership and the socialist system?” On the fundamental issue of political security, we must always be as cautious as if treading on thin ice, always be prepared for danger in times of peace, must not make strategic or fatal mistakes, and must not have any ambiguity or wavering."

We have successfully fought floods, SARS, earthquakes, crises, emergency situations, and epidemics, effectively responding to all kinds of risks and challenges that endanger the fundamental interests of the people.

At the same time, it has also exerted its late-mover advantages and first-mover advantages with great appeal.

Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018","Since the 1980s, the mainland has taken a series of measures to ease Cross-Strait relations and promote the opening of Cross-Strait exchanges in order to break the ice of isolation between the two sides of the Strait. On October 14, 1987, the relevant person in charge at the State Council issued a speech, expressing a “warm welcome to Taiwan compatriots to visit relatives and travel in the mainland of the motherland.” Inspired by the mainland’s policy and the joint efforts of compatriots on both sides of the strait,1 as well as Taiwan’s abandonment of the policy of “no contact, no negotiation, and no compromise,”2 the door to Cross-Strait exchanges has finally been opened. In the past 30 years, great progress has been made in the development of cross-Strait relations. However, it should also be noted that since the structural contradictions between the two sides of the Strait still exist – in particular, the separatist forces on the island of Taiwan are still unwilling to give up their political persistence, the development of Cross-Strait relations is still turbulent. In particular, the Taiwan Strait crisis and Cross-Strait risks continue, seriously affecting the stability of cross-Strait relations and the situation in the Taiwan Strait. With the opening of the door to cross-Strait people-to-people interactions, the real needs of mainland China to deal with the Taiwan Strait crisis and risks have greatly increased. However, since there is no existing processing model to learn from, it will undoubtedly increase the pressure on the mainland to improve its ability to deal with the Taiwan crisis and Cross-Strait risks. Nonetheless, mainland China has continuously strengthened its crisis management capabilities in dealing with the Taiwan Strait crisis and Cross-Strait risks, which has generally guaranteed the stability of the Taiwan Strait region and the development of Cross-Strait relations."

These crises and risks are mainly manifested in the following ways:"
Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018",1. Military security crises and risks
Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018","Crises begin with conflicts, with the possibility of war. This is the broadest description of a crisis. Crisis, as a special situation, has a time pressure and requires decisions. Crises are often highly correlated with chaos and turmoil. Generally speaking, a military security crisis is the most aggravated crisis state among actors and usually refers to a unique phenomenon that lies between peace and war. Since 1949, there have been many military security crises and risks between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. Even in the past 30 years since the door to people-to-people exchanges across the Strait was officially opened, there have been serious Taiwan Strait crises. For example, in 1995, Lee Teng-hui’s visit to the United States and his provocative remarks detonated a major military security crisis in the Taiwan Strait that lasted from 1995 to 1996. This kind of crisis not only caused huge risks to cross-Strait relations but also almost made the situation in the Taiwan Strait approach the brink of war.3 The military security crisis is undoubtedly the most serious of all types of crises across the Taiwan Strait, its level of confrontation is the most intense, and its crisis management proves the most difficult."
Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018","As far as the nature of cross-Strait relations is concerned, since the two sides of the Strait have not officially ended the state of hostility, nor have they signed a cross-Strait peace agreement, there has always been a hidden danger of a military security crisis on both sides of the Strait. However, judging from the development of cross-Strait relations in the past three decades, the military security crisis has not become the protagonist of cross-Strait crises and risks. In fact, with the continuous expansion and deepening of cross-Strait non-governmental exchanges, the frequency of cross-Strait military security crises has been decreasing. Cross-Strait military security crises are extremely harmful and can easily lead to intervention by external forces. Coupled with its high cost, the willingness of all parties to trigger a military security crisis is reduced, such that, objectively speaking, endogenous forces can restrain the outbreak of a cross-Strait military security crisis."

Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018","Structure determines function, and function reacts to structure. Political conflict crises always exist in the interaction of cross-Strait relations, and it is also the most likely trigger of cross-Strait crises and risks. Its influence is mainly manifested in increasing the emotional distance between people on both sides of the Strait, and even causing an emotional rupture that radiates out, affecting the political sentiment of the people on both sides, infecting their political behavior, increasing political estrangement, and worsening the political environment on both sides of the Strait. The frequent occurrence of political conflicts and crises between the two sides of the Strait is mainly attributable to structural contradictions between the two sides of the Strait. From the emergence of the Taiwan issue to today, there have been competitions and struggles between the two sides in terms of ideology, political system, values, and representation. Although Resolution 2758 passed by the 26th UN General Assembly in 1971 has resolved the question of the legitimate representative of China on both sides of the Taiwan Strait from the perspective of international law and international political reality, the situation within Taiwan is very complicated, and serious differences still exist. Moreover, the essence behind this difference is not all that substantial: Whether it is Blue Camp’s formulation of the “one China, two representatives” or the Green Camp’s “separatism” proposition, the logic behind it, of course, still means dealing with the political positioning and identity representation of the Taiwan authorities. The aforementioned problems are of course structural problems that have existed in cross-Strait relations for a long time and are also the main reason for the frequent outbreak of cross-Strait crises and cross-Strait risks over the past three decades. Political conflict crises and risks in cross-Strait relations can be divided into the following:"
Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018","1. Cross-Strait crises triggered by Taiwan’s pursuit of international engagement. Any attempt by Taiwan to expand international participation, especially to join an international organization that only sovereign states can participate in, may lead to incidents and the risk of cross-Strait political conflict. In fact, the confrontation and conflict between the two sides in the field of foreign affairs is a major contributor to the tension in the Taiwan Strait and cross-Strait risks. This constitutes a structural problem in the cross-Strait relationship. In the absence of a final solution to the Taiwan issue, such crises and risks naturally cannot be completely eliminated. Although different political parties are in power in Taiwan, and the magnitude and intensity of foreign-related crises across the Taiwan Strait are different, the nature of foreign-related crises has not changed all that much."
Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018","2. Cross-Strait crises triggered by “Taiwan independence” separatist behavior. “Taiwan independence” is the political ideology and proposition of separatism. For a long time, Taiwan separatism has been one of the main causes of cross-Strait conflict and Taiwan Strait incidents. Since 2000, as the “Taiwan independence” forces continue to gain momentum on the island, the risk of “Taiwan independence” has increasingly become an important source of cross-Strait crises. The “constitutional revision” and “United Nations membership applications” promoted by the Chen Shui-bian authorities have greatly aggravated the crisis situation in the Taiwan Strait and caused unprecedented tension in cross-Strait relations. After the DPP returned to power in 2016, despite claims to “maintain the status quo,” because Tsai Ing-wen authorities have refused to give up actions such as “de-sinicization,”4 cross-Strait relations have been drastically reversed, and the potential risk of a Taiwan Strait incident has greatly increased."
Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018","3. Cross-Strait crises triggered by ideology. The Kuomintang-Communist civil war that broke out from 1946 to 1949 was itself closely related to the serious differences between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party on China’s future development path and system choices. Therefore, since 1949, the cross-Strait struggles and contests in the political system and ideology have never ceased. Even in the past 30 years, although the door to people-to-people exchanges across the Strait has been opened and the social interaction between the two sides has become increasingly frequent, the struggle between the two sides over ideology and values has never stopped.5 The continuous collusion between political forces on the island of Taiwan and various anti-China forces can easily lead to antagonism between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, resulting in the emergence of cross-Strait crises."
Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018","4. Cross-Strait crises caused by Taiwan’s handling of internal affairs. Cross-strait relations are extremely sensitive and complex. Even as Taiwan authorities deal with their internal affairs, seemingly simple issues may trigger a crisis situation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. For example, when the Taiwan authorities deal with so-called “constitutional amendments,” “referendums,” and other issues, as well as major election activities in Taiwan, they may stimulate the sensitive nerves of cross-Strait relations, thereby triggering major events such as the Taiwan Strait crisis and cross-Strait risks."
Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018","5. Cross-Strait crises caused by Taiwan’s handling of external affairs. The Taiwan authorities’ handling of external affairs or interactions with other countries and regions may also trigger a Taiwan Strait crisis and cross-Strait risks. For example, the foreign military procurement by the Taiwan authorities, as well as the close interaction between Taiwan and certain countries in non-economic and cultural fields such as military and security, may cause crises between the two sides of the Strait."
Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018","The cross-Strait political crisis is mainly caused by the structural problems between the two sides of the Strait and usually changes with the situation of cross-Strait relations, especially the change of the ruling party in Taiwan. This is its major feature. When the confrontation between the ruling parties on both sides of the Strait is notable, the political crisis is more prominent. The political crisis across the Taiwan Strait will not only intensify the emotional confrontation between the two sides but may also lead to confrontation and countermeasures between the two sides at a policy level."
Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018",3. Social communication crises and risks
Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018","Crises and risks in social exchanges have been common problems in cross-Strait exchanges in the past. They mainly refer to the crises and risks to cross-Strait relations and even the situation in the Taiwan Strait caused by accidents, travel incidents, personal safety, and other events during the interaction of social personnel across the Strait. The level of this type of crisis is not high, and its impact on cross-Strait relations is mainly reflected in the rise of confrontation or hostility between the two sides, which may affect all aspects of cross-Strait exchanges and thus cannot be ignored."
Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018","In the process of cross-Strait exchanges, it is inevitable that disorder or conflict will occur. Given the large-scale people-to-people exchanges between the two sides of the Strait, it is natural for many social risks to arise. Initially, it has mainly been a matter of cross-border crimes and the smuggling of goods. Since then, there have also been problems such as drug trafficking and triads, as well as environmental, food, and disease transmission issues. This has resulted in the breeding of a series of non-traditional security issues between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and has led to various crises and risks between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. For example, in July 1990, due to the simple, crude, and irresponsible behavior of the Taiwan authorities when dealing with private migrants from the mainland6, a major and vicious incident that eventually resulted in the death of many people shocked society on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and sparked extensive discussions on the need to establish some kind of communication mechanism between the two sides of the Strait to deal with crises. Although the Qiandao Lake Incident in 1994 was just a tragedy that Taiwanese tourists encountered when they traveled to the mainland, its impact on cross-Strait relations should not be underestimated. Since there was not much experience in contact and interaction between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait at that time, there were large differences in the thinking and modes of handling crisis incidents between the two sides. In addition, the Lee Teng-hui authorities took the opportunity to incite public opinion in Taiwanese society and maliciously slander the mainland, all but destroying the benign atmosphere created by the two sides since the Wang-Gu Talks.7 In July 2016, the “burning car incident” occurred in a serious car accident and fire in Taoyuan, Taiwan involving a tour bus for a Liaoning tour group, killing 26 people, including 24 mainland tourists. Although the accident had nothing to do with cross-Strait politics and was a rare tourism crisis, the lack of affection for compatriots by the Taiwan authorities in handling this incident also triggered a strong rebound in mainland public opinion, which had a certain negative impact on cross-Strait relations. Judging from the practice of people-to-people exchanges across the Taiwan Strait over the past three decades, Taiwan Strait crises and cross-Strait risks are mainly reflected in the field of political crises."

Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018",1. Lack of political mutual trust across the Taiwan Strait
Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018","Crisis management requires institutionalized communication channels for all parties involved in the crisis. However, due to the lack of political mutual trust between the two sides, it is difficult to establish effective institutionalized communication channels. The main reason why the crises and risks between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have continued in the past three decades is the lack of political mutual trust between the two sides. In other words, since the state of hostility between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait has not yet subsided, the hostility between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait has not been completely resolved. This is the key to causing turbulence in cross-Strait relations and constant crises across the Strait. The formation of the Taiwan issue was mainly caused by the civil war between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and with the intervention of the United States, the two sides of the Taiwan Strait finally confronted each other across the Taiwan Strait. In the past three decades, although cross-Strait relations have shifted from isolation to exchanges and significant progress has been made, after all, the state of hostility between the two sides has not ended, and the hostility between the two sides has not been completely resolved. The level of mutual trust between the two sides, whether it is through official or private interactions, is still very low. It is precisely because of the extreme lack of political mutual trust between the two sides that the two sides cannot normally carry out institutionalized consultation and cooperation. Even if some institutionalized measures and arrangements have been established at a certain historical stage, once the political parties are rotated, these arrangements often cannot continue to play a substantial role."
Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018",2. Existence of separatist forces in Taiwan
Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018","In the past 30 years, although the people-to-people exchanges between the two sides of the Strait have been very lively, due to the significant differences between the two sides on the future prospects and development path of cross-Strait relations, the struggle between the two sides of the Strait has continued, and even major crises in the Taiwan Strait have occurred. Mainland China actively pursues the goal of the ultimate peaceful reunification of the two sides of the Strait, while what Taiwan pursues is to seek peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, not to lead to the ultimate reunification, especially as the Taiwan separatist forces gradually grow in numbers. This is the main source of tension in cross-Strait relations. This has also led to the continuous struggle between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait over peaceful reunification and maintaining the status quo. As the struggle between reunification and “independence” continues,8 crises have frequently occurred. Since the Taiwan separatist forces disregard the public opinion on both sides of the Strait and the overall interests of the Chinese nation, they wantonly promote the separatist movement, which will inevitably lead to tensions and conflicts on both sides of the Strait and increasingly become the main hidden danger of the Taiwan Strait crisis and cross-Strait risks. In addition, Taiwan’s separatist forces attempt to rely on external forces to counter the reunification process across the Taiwan Strait, which will inevitably lead to an escalation of cross-Strait crises and conflicts."
Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018",3. The United States has been involved in the Taiwan issue for a long time
Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018","The United States has always been an important external factor triggering Taiwan Strait crises. The formation of the Taiwan issue itself also has something to do with the United States. In fact, several major Taiwan Strait crises that broke out since 1949 are inextricably linked with the United States. For example, major crises such as the Kinmen (Quemoy) Artillery Battle in 1958 were inseparable from the direct involvement of the United States in the Taiwan issue, especially the attempt of the United States to concoct “two Chinas” between the two sides of the Strait. At that time, the leaders of mainland China were aware of the conspiracy of the United States, and thus used the Kinmen (Quemoy) Artillery Battle, a crisis event that triggered cross-Strait tensions, to contain Chiang Kai-shek and smash the United States’ attempt to split China. Although great breakthroughs have been made in cross-Strait people-to-people exchanges since 1987, the shadow of the United States is playing a role behind many Taiwan Strait crises and cross-Strait risks. For example, in the Taiwan Strait crisis of 1995-1996, it was precisely because the United States insisted on giving the green light for Lee Teng-hui to visit the United States despite the firm opposition of the Chinese mainland, which triggered tensions in the Taiwan Strait. In this crisis, the United States not only played the role of the initiator of the crisis but also sent an aircraft carrier to the Taiwan Strait region in an attempt to exert military pressure on the mainland. These actions of the United States directly led to the continuous escalation of the Taiwan Strait crisis. In addition to major military security crises, the United States is also an important external source of cross-Strait risks. After the DPP returned to power, even the most basic form of mutual trust between the two sides of the Strait was lacking. However, U.S. President-elect Trump had a direct phone call with Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the Taiwan region. Such behavior was of course a major event, and it also triggered tensions in cross-Strait relations and elevated cross-Strait risks."

The mainland’s attempts and exploration of the Taiwan Strait crisis and risk management are mainly reflected in the aspects of strategy, means, and root causes."
Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018",(i) Attempts and explorations in crisis management strategies
Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018","Crisis escalation is an important model that is often used in crisis management. In crises, escalation is both a common occurrence and is often employed as a strategy, including controlled escalations and limited brinkmanship based on the actual needs and possibilities of the crisis situation. Escalation is at the heart of sound crisis management. Crisis escalation is often the only way to effectively resolve a conflict. “The goal of crisis management is to escalate the crisis to the best possible position but at the same time limit it to the lowest possible level.”9 In reality, although crisis escalation is used as a strategy, this use is by no means arbitrary but is rather based on the practical needs of crisis management. Of course, the implementation of the crisis escalation strategy also requires some basic conditions as a premise. Taking the Taiwan Strait crisis in 1995-1996 as an example, mainland China made good use of the crisis escalation strategy at that time. Although the United States had also dispatched aircraft carriers during this crisis, the United States did not want the situation in the Taiwan Strait to go completely out of control. The goal of mainland China at that time was not to cross the sea to reunify Taiwan but to hope that the Lee Teng-hui authorities could return to the existing political consensus of “one China.” At the same time, mainland China wanted to warn the United States about the wrong policy of supporting Taiwan in the hopes of turning the crisis situation in a direction that is beneficial to mainland China. Therefore, the purpose of conducting military exercises in mainland China was to oppose the interference of external forces in China’s internal affairs and the increasingly arrogant “Taiwan independence” separatist forces. The mainland used deterrence to escalate the Taiwan Strait crisis to a limited extent. The purpose was to declare to the international community that China, on issues related to national sovereignty and territorial integrity, will not succumb to any external pressure and hopes to use this to create more opportunities and greater strategic space for handling the Taiwan issue in the future. The mainland’s crisis escalation strategy has indeed achieved certain results objectively. The military action not only caused Taiwan’s stock market to plummet, capital to outflow, and panic to spread, but it also created a favorable environment on the island to ease tensions across the Taiwan Strait. It was the use of this crisis escalation strategy that finally made the United States realize the complexity of the Taiwan issue and made a commitment to “not support Taiwan’s independence.”10 As a result, the situation in Taiwan would develop in a direction that is beneficial to the mainland. At the same time, in our escalation strategy, in order to prevent the crisis from getting out of control, we have also carried out effective management and control. We still hope to promote the peaceful settlement of the Taiwan issue through communication and contact. From the perspective of rational choices, it is also in the interests of mainland China to avoid direct military conflict with the United States and prevent a large-scale war in the Taiwan Strait. For example, even during the most stressful of times of crisis, the channels between China and the United States in maintaining information exchange have always been relatively smooth. Embassy relations between China and the United States, military exchanges, and high-level negotiations were ongoing.11 In particular, Chinese leader Jiang Zemin and U.S. President Clinton also held a summit meeting at the commemorative meeting of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. The maintenance of these communication channels has a very positive effect on crisis management. Clinton also reiterated that the United States respects Beijing’s position that “Taiwan is part of China.”12 Such a statement certainly played a significant role in easing tensions at the time."

Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018","Mainland China also has gained a gradual understanding of the functions and roles of the United States in the management of the Taiwan Strait crisis. For Beijing’s management of the Taiwan Strait crisis, is the United States a hindrance or a help or is it impossible to draw a simple conclusion? For a long time after 1949, the United States has long been an important external factor that has triggered the outbreak of Taiwan Strait crises. The main reason is that the United States, with its strong military advantages, has been creating crisis situations in the Taiwan Strait in order to achieve its national interests. From this perspective, for the mainland, the role the United States plays in cross-Strait relations and the Taiwan Strait is of course negative. However, in the past three decades, with the rapid increase in the strength of mainland China, the relative strength of China and the United States has drawn closer. The United States has grown increasingly worried about the risk of being drawn into a cross-Strait conflict or even a military confrontation that could directly trigger the rivalry between the two major powers. This is obviously what the United States does not wish to see. Under such circumstances, the United States began to block and oppose Lee Teng-hui’s “two-state theory” and Chen Shui-bian’s “United Nations application,” “constitution referendum,” and other “Taiwan independence” behaviors. Therefore, there have been some changes in the role and function of the United States in cross-Strait relations. As a result, China and the United States have at least a certain degree of space and opportunity for cooperation on the major issue of suppressing “Taiwan independence.” In the past 30 years of cross-Strait crisis management, the role of the United States has begun to show some positive energy. In the least, the United States has become a positive factor in restraining “Taiwan independence” forces. The mainland has also increasingly found that maintaining the peace and stability of cross-Strait relations is crucial. In particular, taking the United States as an important party in the management of the Taiwan Strait crisis will also help the mainland to improve the efficiency of Taiwan Strait crisis management. Of course, the U.S. factor requires dialectical analysis and evaluation, taking into account its negative aspects. At this stage, both sides of the Taiwan Strait cannot completely rule out the intervention and influence of the United States in the management of the Taiwan Strait crisis, and the U.S. factor will still exist for a certain period of time in the future. The negative role of crisis management in the Taiwan Strait is a major issue worthy of consideration."

Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018","For a long time, due to the complexity of the Taiwan issue itself and the strong intervention of external forces, in the face of the complex Taiwan Strait crisis situation, mainland China has relatively limited means of crisis management. Especially with the development of “Taiwan independence” forces on the island, the pressure on the mainland to deal with the crisis in the Taiwan Strait is increasing day by day. However, with the continuous enhancement of mainland China’s comprehensive strength and a deeper understanding of the Taiwan issue itself, the mainland has begun to use legal means to strengthen the management of the Taiwan Strait crisis. On March 14, 2005, the National People’s Congress, after deliberation, passed the Anti-Secession Law, which clearly stipulated and provided a legal basis for the argument that the Taiwan issue is a matter of China’s internal affairs. The Anti-Secession Law undoubtedly draws an insurmountable red line for the “Taiwan independence” separatist forces and is also the fundamental bottom line for cross-Strait relations. It also provides legal means for mainland China to strengthen the management of the Taiwan Strait crisis and its risk management."

Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018","Over the past 30 years of cross-Strait exchanges, the outbreaks of Taiwan Strait crises, of course, have complex social and historical roots and backgrounds. For crisis management to have a real effect, it is necessary to eliminate the root causes of the crises. In addition to the structural contradictions between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, the outbreaks of Taiwan Strait crises are directly related to the limited scope and depth of cross-Strait exchanges. For a long time, Taiwanese society’s perception of the mainland has been largely misunderstood. In the past 30 years, although a cross-Strait exchange situation has been formed, the strength of the exchanges is insufficient, and the duration of exchanges has not been long. At the same time, Taiwanese society still doesn’t know much about the connotation of the mainland’s policy toward Taiwan, as well as the development status and prospects of the mainland. These matters must be gradually resolved through cross-Strait non-governmental exchanges. Under this circumstance, mainland China adopted the policy of prioritizing economics before politics, going after the easy before the difficult. By promoting the interaction between people on both sides of the Strait through economic, cultural, social, and other exchanges, China has laid a solid economic foundation and public opinion foundation for continuous breakthroughs in cross-Strait relations. Especially since 2008, cross-Strait relations have entered a stage of peaceful development. Cross-Strait trade, mail, and navigation have been basically realized, and various exchanges have been greatly advanced. It has shortened the distance between the people and the society on both sides of the Strait and has enhanced affection."
Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018","At present, cross-Strait economic and trade exchanges flow from Taiwan to the mainland through the flow of people, logistics, and capital. The flow of people, logistics, and capital from the mainland entered the island at a later stage. Today, on both sides of the strait, a positive interaction pattern is taking shape of mutual need. The continuous flow and integration of cross-Strait economies, societies, and demands will connect the two societies on both sides of the Strait, naturally forming a material foundation for cross-Strait crisis management and risk management and providing both sides with greater means and possibilities."

Therefore, the direct goal of crisis management across the Taiwan Strait is of course not the pursuit of unification. From this point of view, the management of the Taiwan Strait crisis in the past three decades has been quite successful."
Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018","Over the past 30 years, the situation in the Taiwan Strait has not been calm. In particular, the intervention of the United States and waves of provocations by the “Taiwan independence” forces on the island have caused constant crises, even major military and security crises, but we have ultimately ensured the situation in Taiwan never went out of control and never led to conflict or war. This has also enabled the long-term and continuous exchanges of cross-Strait relations, especially the continuous development of interactions in the economic, social, and personnel fields, such that the two sides of the Strait continue to move from confrontation to reconciliation. From this point of view, the crisis management objective of the mainland has been fully achieved, and its effect is also positive. The stability of the situation in the Taiwan Strait and cross-Strait relations is also the strategic goal of the Chinese mainland. In particular, the grand strategy of reform and opening up has created a favorable cross-Strait environment. Not only is it conducive to the re-communication and cooperation between mainland China and the international community, but it also makes Taiwan an important participant in the mainland’s reform and opening up. The mainland’s economic development has made significant progress and its overall national strength has been greatly enhanced, a success of the past three decades. All of this is of course closely related to the mainland’s successful management of the Taiwan Strait crisis."

Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018","From the observation of the situation of the Taiwan Strait crisis and cross-Strait risks in the past three decades, the “Taiwan independence” forces have increasingly become the main source of the outbreak of the Taiwan Strait crisis, which has attracted great attention from the mainland, and the mainland has also continuously strengthened the management and control of the “Taiwan independence” crisis. Regarding the issue of “Taiwan independence,” its essence is a separatist ideology and political proposition, which is particularly harmful to cross-Strait relations. Of course, the struggle for “Taiwan independence” will be a long-term process. Since the development of cross-Strait relations, cross-Strait interaction is no longer just a relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party but now also involves the pressure of resisting and guarding against separatism."
Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018","Under the current situation of the DPP’s return to power where cross-Strait relations are at an impasse, the mainland must resolutely oppose any form of “Taiwan independence” activities. As General Secretary Xi Jinping said in his report to the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, we “will never allow any person, organization, or political party to separate any piece of Chinese territory from at any time and in any form.”13 From a global perspective, separatist movements have spread all over the world, seriously affecting national and regional peace and stability. Over the past three decades, the frequent outbreak of crises in the Taiwan Strait and cross-Strait risks is directly related to the growing arrogance of the “Taiwan independence” forces on the island. It can be said that the “Taiwan independence” forces have become the main hidden danger of detonating Taiwan Strait crises and cross-Strait risks. Mainland China, through proactive and proactive crisis management strategies, has effectively curbed the attempts of the “Taiwan independence” forces to separate Taiwan from Chinese territory. In this way, Taiwan Strait crises and cross-Strait risks can always be controlled to a certain extent and scope so that the situation never goes completely out of control. This, of course, has something to do with the mainland’s appropriate crisis management strategies. Judging from the actual situation, although the DPP has won a ruling position twice, the Green Camp authorities do not dare to ignore the reality on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and do not dare to pursue a radical “Taiwan independence” line and can only adopt the policy orientation of maintaining the status quo. As such, the “Taiwan independence” forces can only admit defeat.14"

External causes of Taiwan Strait crises and risk outbreaks must be vigorously eliminated in order to effectively maintain “One China.” Because of this, over the past 30 years, the mainland has resolutely curbed the Taiwan authorities’ various “Taiwan independence” separatist acts in the international community and has actively sought the understanding and support of the international community for China’s position against “Taiwan independence” to great effect. At present, the vast majority of countries in the world adhere to the “One China” policy. More and more countries have clearly expressed their opposition to “Taiwan independence,” opposing any words and deeds of the Taiwan authorities aimed at changing Taiwan’s status and moving towards “Taiwan independence” and any acts by the Taiwan authorities to undermine peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. The Taiwan authorities’ attempts to “return to the United Nations” and squeeze into the World Health Organization have been thwarted year after year.

Since then, the leaders of the Taiwan region have not been able to visit the United States during their term of office, which is also an important achievement of our side in strengthening the management of the crisis in the Taiwan Strait. In addition, taking Taiwan’s foreign military relations as an example, it is through crisis management that mainland China has effectively prevented the intervention of external forces. In the 1990s, European countries were keen to carry out arms sales to Taiwan, especially France’s sale of Mirage 2000 aircraft to Taiwan. This undoubtedly triggered pressure on crisis management in the Taiwan Strait. If we did not block the way for France to sell arms to Taiwan and will indirectly induce other European countries and even other regional countries to follow France’s example of selling arms to Taiwan. To this end, China strengthened crisis management, and ultimately, the French government promised not to allow French companies to participate in arming Taiwan in the future.15 For us, blocking the way for France to sell arms to Taiwan dispelled the notion for other European countries to follow the example of France in selling arms to Taiwan. Under the international situation at the time, this was indeed a very difficult achievement."
Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018",(iii) Adhering to the idea of development
Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018","The core of crisis management in the Taiwan Strait is to face the essence of the Taiwan issue. The Taiwan issue itself is extremely complex, involving not only the entanglements and disputes in the past but also true power and interests. Therefore, dealing with Taiwan-related issues requires grand strategic thinking so that the efficiency of crisis management can be achieved. In fact, as long as the Taiwan issue has not been completely resolved, any form of crisis management across the Taiwan Strait will only serve as a temporary cooling effect, as there is no way to fundamentally eliminate the root cause of the Taiwan Strait crisis. In other words, the outbreaks of Taiwan Strait crises will exist for a long time to come. Therefore, it is necessary to think about the Taiwan issue from the perspective of development and from the perspective of serving the national strategy. Only in this way can Taiwan Strait crises and cross-Strait risks be effectively dealt with."
Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018","At present, the use of development thinking and strategies to solve the Taiwan issue and deal with crises in the Taiwan Strait and its risks is to place the solution of the Taiwan issue in China’s overall thinking of state governance. We must strengthen the management of the Taiwan Strait crises by improving the effectiveness of governance. In fact, the concepts of cross-Strait integration and development currently proposed by mainland China well reflect the meaning of governance."
Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018",(iv) Promoting institutionalized negotiations
Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018","For the management of Taiwan Strait crises, it is particularly important to promote the construction of an institutionalized communication mechanism. Under the circumstance that the structural contradiction between the two sides has not been resolved, the importance of an institutionalized communication and consultation mechanism across the Taiwan Strait for resolving the Taiwan Strait crisis is self-evident. In the past 30 years, the institutionalized consultation mechanism between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait has also made some progress and achieved many achievements. For example, at the beginning of the opening up of cross-Strait non-governmental exchanges, especially around 1990, a small number of people in the coastal areas of Fujian went to Taiwan privately, and this caused several tragic incidents around repatriation. In this situation, the Red Cross organizations on both sides of the strait played an important role in communication and signed a repatriation operation agreement to incorporate the repatriation of smugglers into standardized procedures; this is the famous “Kinmen Agreement” of cross-Strait relations. The SEF and the ARATS were established in 1990 and 1991, respectively, as non-governmental organizations with permanent authorization on both sides of the Strait. The “Two Sessions” were described by the media as having “white glove” roles and functions. With the in-depth development of cross-Strait exchanges, the interaction between the institutions and persons in charge of cross-Strait affairs has become necessary, and it is also an important institutionalized attempt to deal with the Taiwan Strait crisis and cross-Strait risks. In 2014, Zhang Zhijun, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, and Wang Yuqi, head of Taiwan’s “Mainland Commission,” met in Nanjing, officially opening the mechanism for normalized communication between cross-Strait affairs agencies and their leaders. This is one of the important mechanisms for both sides to deal with crises and risks. In addition, the more than 20 agreements signed by the two sides of the Strait in the past are also an important part of the cross-Strait system consultation mechanism, which has played an important role in resolving Taiwan Strait crises."
Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018","At present, the difficulties between the two sides of the Strait are mainly due to the unwillingness of the DPP to return to the common political consensus between the two sides after returning to power. This is the biggest challenge in promoting the institutionalized consultation mechanism between the two sides. Observing from the 30-year history of cross-Strait people-to-people exchanges, institutionalized communication channels are very important, and although this communication channel is not enough to resolve all disputes between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, its effectiveness is quite limited. However, for the management of the Taiwan Strait crisis, establishing cross-Strait communication channels are crucial to advance the institutionalized consultation mechanism across the Taiwan Strait."
Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018",IV. Conclusion
Taiwan Strait Crisis and Risk Management: The Case of 1987-2017,"Taiwan Studies , Chen Xiancai","Feb 20, 2018","30 years of people-to-people exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have written a moving chapter from enmity to reconciliation between the two sides of the Strait.16 Although the Taiwan issue is China’s core national interest, based on the overall strategy of national development, the mainland considers the solution to the Taiwan issue under the grand strategy of mainland China’s economic development and national rejuvenation. Mainland China hopes to gradually create a better internal and external environment for resolving the Taiwan issue through the road of development and opening up. This is an important consideration for Taiwan’s strategy. It is under the guidance of this line of thinking that in the past three decades, mainland China has adopted a relatively restrained and pragmatic approach to the management of Taiwan Strait crises and cross-Strait risks. This effectively guarantees the advancement of the main task. At the same time, this has not made the Taiwan issue fall out of control. It has not only provided a more favorable situation for the resolutions of Taiwan Strait crises but has also created more conditions for the final settlement of the Taiwan issue."
Ten Revelations from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict Concerning China’s Energy Security,"Energy , Xu Jin","May 10, 2022","The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has been going on for two months and at present there is still no sign of a turnaround or improvement. With the unprecedented economic sanctions and unreasonable suppression of Russia by Western countries led by the United States, in reality, this conflict is no longer a simple battle between two countries—Russia and Ukraine—but is a struggle in the geopolitical relationship between the United States and Russia and over world energy hegemony. In today’s world, geopolitics and energy strategies are intertwined. As long as any country touches the “network” of U.S. global hegemony and refuses to submit to its will, no matter how big or small, how powerful or weak, at some point, it will inevitably experience the sanctions and pressure which Russia is currently suffering."
Ten Revelations from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict Concerning China’s Energy Security,"Energy , Xu Jin","May 10, 2022","How, from an energy perspective, to explore the problems and risks brought by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, what “after-effects” it will bring, what insights China needs to derive from it, and what preparations we need to make to take preventive measures, is a set of strategic questions which deserve everyone’s serious consideration."
Ten Revelations from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict Concerning China’s Energy Security,"Energy , Xu Jin","May 10, 2022","Specifically, the Russia-Ukraine conflict will bring the following ten revelations for China’s energy security:"
Ten Revelations from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict Concerning China’s Energy Security,"Energy , Xu Jin","May 10, 2022",Revelation 1: The energy rice bowl must be firmly grasped in our own hands
Ten Revelations from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict Concerning China’s Energy Security,"Energy , Xu Jin","May 10, 2022","Energy is both the lifeblood of a modern economy, and the cornerstone of modern society’s survival and development. Every leap in the development of energy leads to the rapid progress of human production technology and promote the rapid development of productivity. Whether it is from the age of charcoal to the age of coal, or from the age of coal to the age of oil, or the subsequent development of atomic energy and the entrance onto the stage of a flurry of new energy sources, these developments have all brought new vitality to civilizations that have been close to a standstill. If you cannot keep a firm hold of your country’s energy lifeline in your own hands, all that’s left is to passively take a beating."
Ten Revelations from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict Concerning China’s Energy Security,"Energy , Xu Jin","May 10, 2022","Current European sanctions on Russia’s energy sector are akin to throwing out the baby with the bathwater or, as the saying goes, sacrificing 1,000 to kill 800 enemy troops: Germany suspended the certification of the famous Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline project, meaning the completed gas pipeline is not carrying gas. Western energy giants in quick succession each withdrew from the Russian market, collectively restricting Russian coal, oil, and gas imports. Fortunately, Russia is a big energy country, so there is no need to worry about energy being put in a stranglehold by Western countries. For others, such an energy blockade would be the same as a death sentence."
Ten Revelations from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict Concerning China’s Energy Security,"Energy , Xu Jin","May 10, 2022",Revelation 2: The establishment of an RMB-denominated energy trading system should be accelerated
Ten Revelations from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict Concerning China’s Energy Security,"Energy , Xu Jin","May 10, 2022","Finance is at the heart of the modern economy. Since the start of the conflict, Western countries’ economic sanctions against Russia, especially financial sanctions, have stopped at nothing. Nearly half of Russia’s foreign exchange reserves have been frozen by Western countries, and SWIFT, the common international payment method, has excluded them, causing Russia’s economy to be instantaneously “isolated” by the West. Then there has been a string of different dazzling “list-pulling” methods such as canceling Russia’s trade most-favored-nation treatment and freezing the huge assets of Russian oligarchs."
Ten Revelations from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict Concerning China’s Energy Security,"Energy , Xu Jin","May 10, 2022","In this regard, as the world’s largest net energy importer, China must take precautions and participate more actively in the international financial system. We must work faster to drive the internationalization of the RMB, act with initiative to promote the construction of the energy and derivatives market system, and continuously improve the rules and regulations of Shanghai crude oil futures to accelerate the establishment of a “petro-RMB” system denominated in RMB. We must actively build a natural gas trading system for RMB pricing and settlement and strive to explore the establishment of a new energy RMB pricing and settlement system so as to continuously amplify our voice in the international energy field."
Ten Revelations from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict Concerning China’s Energy Security,"Energy , Xu Jin","May 10, 2022",Revelation 3: Ensuring diversification of energy supply is imperative
Ten Revelations from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict Concerning China’s Energy Security,"Energy , Xu Jin","May 10, 2022","During the present Russia-Ukraine conflict, the reason that Europe has been ridiculed as “being taken advantage of for their generosity” is that the energy shortage which they face and the continuous surge in prices result from their high level of dependence on Russian energy. 40% of their natural gas, 27% of their oil, and 46% of their coal come from Russia. It is not realistic for the continent to detach itself from Russia’s energy supply in the short term, and, ultimately, it must be European companies and ordinary people who foot the bill from sanctions."
Ten Revelations from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict Concerning China’s Energy Security,"Energy , Xu Jin","May 10, 2022","Therefore, in a context in which China’s total energy consumption continues to increase and its import dependence grows, we need to make full use of the international market’s energy resources and to strengthen vigorous cooperation with different regional energy agencies to promote the diversification of energy supply sources. We must make a big push to build a three-dimensional onshore pipeline transportation route, continuously strengthen sea transportation capacity, and form a three-dimensional energy import source channel and transportation network. We must change as quickly as possible the energy consumption structure in which coal and other traditional energy form the main body and actively switch to a comprehensive and balanced energy structure which utilizes both fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) and clean energy (hydropower, nuclear power, renewable energy, etc.). We must avoid having all our eggs in one basket."
Ten Revelations from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict Concerning China’s Energy Security,"Energy , Xu Jin","May 10, 2022",Revelation 4: It is urgent that strategic energy reserve capacity be improved
Ten Revelations from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict Concerning China’s Energy Security,"Energy , Xu Jin","May 10, 2022","Oil and gas are known as the “blood” and “oxygen” which modern economic development cannot do without. Adequate strategic oil and gas reserves are vitally important to ensuring energy supply and price stability. In 2021, China’s crude oil and natural gas imports amounted to 513 million tons and 167.5 billion cubic meters, respectively, with external dependencies of 72% and 44.9%. Compared with developed countries, China’s oil and gas strategic reserves are seriously insufficient and lagging behind. Strategic oil reserves stand at about 70 days of consumption, which is quite a way off from the 90-day reserve safety standard set by the International Energy Agency. The gap is even more obvious compared with developed countries (e.g. the U.S. oil reserves are at about 160 days and Japan’s oil reserves stand at about 144 days)."
Ten Revelations from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict Concerning China’s Energy Security,"Energy , Xu Jin","May 10, 2022","From this we can see that China’s oil and gas energy strategic reserve demand and growth space are still considerable, and it is urgent that we improve our strategic reserve capacity. This is especially true in the current context of a turbulent and changing international situation and oil and gas prices which remain high. We need to put the construction of oil and gas reserve systems in a position of equal importance to that of our investment in oil and gas exploration and development, and give shape as quickly as possible to a three-in-one reserve model of government reserves, corporate social responsibility reserves, and production and operation inventory."
Ten Revelations from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict Concerning China’s Energy Security,"Energy , Xu Jin","May 10, 2022",Revelation 5: Steps toward traditional energy transformation must be more stable
Ten Revelations from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict Concerning China’s Energy Security,"Energy , Xu Jin","May 10, 2022","The Russia-Ukraine conflict shows that it is still difficult for the world to be without traditional energy sources, and the road to a clean and low-carbon transformation of energy will not be plain sailing. As we progress along this path, there will be “growing pains,” as it is often the case that expectations fail to align with reality. The basic pattern of China’s current energy is “a lot of coal, not so much oil, and a lack of gas.” The introduction of the “dual carbon” goal has brought unprecedented challenges and pressures for the traditional energy industry. Oil, coal, gas, and electricity, as big reducers, are the key industries and targets of “carbon reduction” and have a long way to go."
Ten Revelations from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict Concerning China’s Energy Security,"Energy , Xu Jin","May 10, 2022","Particularly in the second half of last year, the power rationing crisis in many parts of China showed that although the new energy industry has been “infinitely good” in recent years, it still cannot make up for the supply gap in traditional energy. Traditional energy will still, for a long time to come, play the role of “ballast stone.” Although China’s energy transformation is the general trend and is imperative, we must fully consider the objective reality, first establish the new and then break down the old, proceed step by step, and avoid “campaign-style” carbon reduction. A “one-size-fits-all” approach goes against objective laws, and blindly seeking success will lead to nothing but endless misfortune."
Ten Revelations from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict Concerning China’s Energy Security,"Energy , Xu Jin","May 10, 2022",Revelation 6: Accelerating the development of new energy has become a top priority
Ten Revelations from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict Concerning China’s Energy Security,"Energy , Xu Jin","May 10, 2022","The Russia-Ukraine conflict will lead Europe to add new energy sources in order to completely rid itself of its over-reliance on Russian energy. Germany even plans to achieve 100% renewable energy power generation by 2035. In the new energy field, China has the world’s largest market for production capacity, investment, construction, and operation and maintenance. Our production capacity of solar polysilicon accounts for more than 70% of the world’s production capacity, and our production capacity of wind turbines accounts for nearly half of the world’s total. In 2021, the installed capacity of both wind power and solar power in China will exceed the 300-million-kilowatt mark, ranking first in the world for many consecutive years. Newly installed wind and solar power generation capacity in that year exceeded 100 million kilowatts, which is more than three times that of the second-ranked United States."
Ten Revelations from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict Concerning China’s Energy Security,"Energy , Xu Jin","May 10, 2022","However, we must also see clearly that China is a big country in the production and manufacture of new energy, but not a strong country, and our associated technology patent reserves are seriously insufficient. According to relevant information, among the international patent applications for new energy from 2009 to 2019, Europe accounted for 28%, the United States accounted for 20%, and China accounted for only 8%. Therefore, on the road to green development, China must take steady steps forward, and speed up progress towards a low-carbon and clean era, truly transforming production capacity and market advantages into ecological advantages and competitive advantages."
Ten Revelations from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict Concerning China’s Energy Security,"Energy , Xu Jin","May 10, 2022",Revelation 7: Energy technology innovation has become more prominent
Ten Revelations from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict Concerning China’s Energy Security,"Energy , Xu Jin","May 10, 2022","The energy game brought about by the Russia-Ukraine conflict reflects the new situation in energy power transfer. With the advancement of the energy technology revolution, energy power will also undergo qualitative changes. Although China’s energy sector has formed a complete production chain, supply chain, and value chain which is fairly strong in terms of international competitiveness, compared with the world’s energy S&T powers and the need to lead the energy revolution, China’s energy technology innovation is still some way behind, and there are still many shortcomings. These include: insufficient investment in cutting-edge technologies, hydrogen energy, fuel cells, carbon emissions, and other technical patents, which are mainly in the hands of Europe, the United States, and Japan; some of the key core technologies have long been controlled by others, with large gas turbines, high-temperature materials, and core components monopolized by foreign countries; independent research results are limited, commonly used energy design software, optimization software, simulation software, and control system software are heavily dependent on foreign countries, and the level of modernization of the energy industry chain awaits further improvement."
Ten Revelations from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict Concerning China’s Energy Security,"Energy , Xu Jin","May 10, 2022",Only by increasing S&T innovation and striving to seize the commanding heights of the energy revolution can we seize the first opportunities in the new round of energy power transfer and truly become the final winner. This is the trump card for ensuring that China is not put in a stranglehold by other countries.
Ten Revelations from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict Concerning China’s Energy Security,"Energy , Xu Jin","May 10, 2022",Revelation 8: Strengthening neighboring energy cooperation has become an important support
Ten Revelations from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict Concerning China’s Energy Security,"Energy , Xu Jin","May 10, 2022","The root cause of the Russia-Ukraine conflict lies in the eastward expansion of NATO, and the chief director behind this is the United States. A very sad thing about Russia is that out of nine countries bordering Russia in Europe, eight have turned against it, making it easy for the United States to find “wedges” and breakthroughs to make waves."
Ten Revelations from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict Concerning China’s Energy Security,"Energy , Xu Jin","May 10, 2022","The lesson we have learned from this is that we must adhere long-term to good-neighborly and friendly policies, extensively strengthen cooperation in all aspects of the energy field, use transnational oil and gas pipelines to create the main arteries of friendly energy cooperation, use the electric power interconnection between countries as a bridge for friendly cooperation, and use the “Global Energy Internet” to create a platform for mutual cooperation between countries, building a long-term stable, interdependent, mutually beneficial, and closer positive cooperative relationship with neighboring countries and regions in the energy field, and forming a community with a shared future wherein there is a part of us within others and of others within us, leaving no opportunities for U.S.-led Western countries to sow discord, create estrangement, or break into wedges, and thwarting their despicable tricks."
Ten Revelations from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict Concerning China’s Energy Security,"Energy , Xu Jin","May 10, 2022",Revelation 9: The energy game with Europe and the United States will continue to intensify
Ten Revelations from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict Concerning China’s Energy Security,"Energy , Xu Jin","May 10, 2022","The Russia-Ukraine conflict is extremely likely to lead to the splitting of the global energy system, forming two relatively parallel energy systems based principally on China and India “using Russian energy” and principally on the United States and Europe “moving away from Russia.” In particular, in the current situation wherein the United States is leading a group of “little followers” to do their level best to suppress and crowd out China, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has conveniently allowed them to seize the “good opportunity” to do evil and find a “pretext” to launch their attack. As such, the China-U.S. energy game is very much likely to intensify."
Ten Revelations from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict Concerning China’s Energy Security,"Energy , Xu Jin","May 10, 2022","China must weigh up the advantages and disadvantages, excel at using struggle strategies, and never blindly confront challenges. We must make full use of Russia’s eagerness to strengthen cooperation with China to make up for its losses in Europe and stabilize the overall plan and direction of Sino-Russian energy cooperation, ensuring the steady and long-term development of Sino-Russian energy cooperation. At the same time, we must also excel at using the divergent interests and demands of European countries and the United States in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, find common points and joint avenues of cooperation, carry out reasonable and disciplined struggles, and maintain strategic patience and perseverance. We must increase understanding in stalemates, resolve suspicions in cooperation, and ensure that we struggle but don’t break, that we compete and cooperate."
Ten Revelations from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict Concerning China’s Energy Security,"Energy , Xu Jin","May 10, 2022",Revelation 10: Building an energy strategic alliance needs to be put on the agenda
Ten Revelations from the Russia-Ukraine Conflict Concerning China’s Energy Security,"Energy , Xu Jin","May 10, 2022","From the Russia-Ukraine conflict, it is clear that the United States is handier and more proficient in forming factions and building “small circles” of interests. In the face of the unreasonable suppression by the United States and the increasingly evident “decoupling” between China and the U.S., China cannot always respond passively but needs to make well-timed and proactive strikes, embrace the world with a broader mind, and make full use of China’s position as the world’s largest energy importer and the largest energy consumer. Adhering to the concept of a community with a shared future for humankind, under the premise of the principles of “mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, win-win cooperation, and honesty,” we should build global energy strategic cooperation alliances at different levels and within different fields. We should deepen cooperation with traditional energy markets in regions such as Central Asia and Russia, Africa, and the Middle East, and actively open up new energy markets such as North America and South America and build broader global energy partnerships. We should actively participate in global energy dialogues and actively advocate new concepts of global energy security. We should replace confrontation with cooperation, replace monopoly with mutual benefit, and continuously expand the “circle of friends” for energy exchanges and cooperation."

The 10th Anniversary of Cooperation Between China and Central and Eastern Europe: How to Continue to Maintain Steady Progress in the Future,"The Paper , Fudan Europe Watch","Jul 2, 2022","However, on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the development of the mechanism, in the context of the highly complex international situation, it has also encountered some challenges. First, it requires a particularly clear strategic line to guide development over the next decade. Second, the stability and sustainability of the mechanism must be strengthened. Third, the EU’s doubts about the existence of the mechanism need to be dispelled. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out appropriate reforms so that the mechanism can continue to play its due role."
The 10th Anniversary of Cooperation Between China and Central and Eastern Europe: How to Continue to Maintain Steady Progress in the Future,"The Paper , Fudan Europe Watch","Jul 2, 2022","Gao Xiaochuan: Against the backdrop of new changes in the relationship between major powers, China-CEEC cooperation has entered its tenth year. As a new paradigm of trans-regional multilateral cooperation, this mechanism has played a positive role in expanding multilateral diplomacy and practical cooperation between China and CEEC. At present, with the United States increasing its strategic reliance on Central and Eastern Europe and the European Union’s prominent geopolitical role, the internal and external environments of Central and Eastern Europe are becoming more complex. In the process of deepening China-CEEC cooperation, external contradictory and restrictive factors are becoming more and more prominent. Against this background, the question of how to strengthen the role of the China-CEEC cooperation mechanism is worthy of in-depth consideration."

At the same time, the China-CEEC cooperation mechanism has played a role in promoting the friendly attitude of Hungary and other countries towards China. Therefore, although Chinese officials have always emphasized that the cooperation mechanism is a mutually beneficial mechanism dedicated to the development of economic exchanges, its positive role in promoting political relations between China and CEECs cannot be ignored."

First of all, the main original intention of the CEECs when the mechanism was established was to attract Chinese investment to develop their own economies and reduce their dependence on Western European countries. However, the economic benefits brought by the cooperation mechanism are not yet significant. However, since the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020, the bilateral trade between China and CEECs has grown significantly against the trend. In 2021, it increased by 29.7%, reaching US$124.02 billion, accounting for 15% of the total bilateral trade between China and Europe. At the same time, however, due to the trade deficit with China, some countries face a certain gap between their expectations and reality."

The second is to serve China-Europe relations, that is, the development of relations between China and CEECs must obey and serve the healthy growth of the relationship between China and Europe such that this cooperation mechanism can become a useful supplement to the development of China-EU relations. Both China and CEECs should handle issues as responsible members of the international community and beware of political manipulation affecting the development of bilateral relations. The third is to adjust responses to multiple issues, that is, to recognize that different issues such as in politics, economics, society, security, and strategy are mutually reinforcing but they cannot replace one another.

The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,"Qiushi , Xi Jinping","May 15, 2022","As we enter into a new stage of development, China’s internal and external environment for development has undergone profound changes, and there are many new major problems that need to be correctly understood and grasped. Here, I focus on a few issues."
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,"Qiushi , Xi Jinping","May 15, 2022","The first issue: we must correctly understand and grasp the strategic goals and practical ways to achieve common prosperity. “The wealthy people of a country must care about enriching the common people.” The creation and distribution of wealth is a major issue faced by all countries. For some western countries, as social wealth has continued to grow so has wealth disparity and polarization. In some Latin American countries, income is not high, but the distribution gap in wealth is very large. Under China’s socialist system, it is not only necessary to continuously liberate and develop social productive forces, and to continuously create and accumulate social wealth, but also to prevent polarization, and to earnestly promote the all-around development of human beings and the common prosperity of all people to achieve more obvious and substantial progress. In the past, we were egalitarian at a low-income level. After the reform and opening up, some regions and some people became rich first, and the income gap gradually widened. The improper accumulation of some wealth has brought risks and challenges to the healthy operation of the economy and society."
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,"Qiushi , Xi Jinping","May 15, 2022","Common prosperity is the essential requirement of socialism with Chinese characteristics. What should the path to common prosperity look like? We are currently exploring this. To achieve the goal of common prosperity, we must first make the “cake” bigger and better through the joint efforts of the people of the whole country, and then correctly handle the relationship between growth and distribution through reasonable institutional arrangements, so as to divide the “cake” well. This is a long-term historical process. We must create conditions, improve systems, and steadily move towards this goal."
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,"Qiushi , Xi Jinping","May 15, 2022","It is necessary to strengthen employment as a priority in order to promote high-quality development. Employment is the foundation of people’s livelihood. Employment is the driving force of economic growth, so it is important to continuously promote the expansion of employment and the improvement of the quality of employment. It is necessary to support the development of small, medium and micro enterprises and give full play to their role as a channel for employers. It is necessary to learn from the lessons of some Western countries’ economic transitions from the “real to the virtual,” 1 continue to expand the real economy, and create more high-quality jobs. It is necessary to increase investment in human capital, improve the quality of education, strengthen vocational education and skills training, improve the quality of workers, better meet the needs of high-quality development, and effectively prevent large-scale unemployment risks."
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,"Qiushi , Xi Jinping","May 15, 2022","It is important that everyone is performing their assigned function and role. It is necessary to properly handle the relationship between efficiency and fairness, and build basic institutional arrangements for primary distribution, redistribution, and coordination of three distributions. We must adhere to the principle of distribution according to work, increase the proportion of labor remuneration in the initial distribution, and improve the policy of distribution according to different factors. It is necessary to give full play to the role of redistribution, and increase the adjustment of taxation, social security, transfer payments, etc., and improve the accuracy of record keeping. It is necessary to give full play to the role of the Third Distribution Theory, 2 and guide and support willing and capable enterprises and social groups to actively participate in public welfare and charitable undertakings without engaging in “forced donations” in the form of moral kidnapping."
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,"Qiushi , Xi Jinping","May 15, 2022","It is necessary to improve the public service policy system. To promote common prosperity, we must not engage in “welfare”. Some Latin American countries in the past have engaged in populism, and welfare in these countries has raised a group of “lazy people” with unearned incomes. As a result, the countries’ financial systems were overwhelmed and fell into the “middle-income trap” 3, that they were unable to extricate themselves from for a long time. Welfare benefits cannot decrease if they go up, and “Welfare-ism” that exceeds one’s ability is unsustainable, and it will inevitably bring about serious economic and political problems! We must adhere to doing our best and do what we can, focusing on improving the level of public services, accurately providing basic public services in the fields of education, medical care, elderly care, housing and other areas that the people are most concerned about, and taking care of the most basic needs of life for people in need, without raising the expectation of welfare to cover all expenses, or providing empty promises."
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,"Qiushi , Xi Jinping","May 15, 2022","The second issue: correctly understand and grasp the characteristics and behavioral laws of capital. Marx and Engels did not envisage that a market economy could be developed under socialist conditions, and of course they could not foresee how socialist countries would treat capital. Although Lenin and Stalin led the socialist construction of the Soviet Union, at that time the Soviet Union implemented a highly centralized planned economic system and basically did not encounter large-scale capital problems. To engage in a socialist market economy is a great creation of our party. Since it is a socialist market economy, it will inevitably produce various forms of capital. Although there are many differences between capital in capitalist society and capital in socialist society, capital is all about chasing profits. “The key to uniting the people is to manage their wealth appropriately 4. We should explore how to play the positive role of capital under the conditions of a socialist market economy, while effectively controlling the negative role of capital. In recent years, due to lack of awareness and lack of supervision, capital has expanded in a disorderly way, manipulated arbitrarily, and made huge profits in some areas of our country. This requires regulating the behavior of capital, seeking advantages and avoiding disadvantages, not allowing “capital predators” to act recklessly, but also giving full play to the function of capital as a factor of production. This is a major political and economic issue that cannot be avoided."
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,"Qiushi , Xi Jinping","May 15, 2022","In practical work, the following points should be paid attention to. To set “traffic lights” for capital. “Traffic lights” apply to all means of transportation on the road, and the same is true for capital. All types of capital cannot run amok. To prevent the savage growth of some capital, we must fight against monopoly, profiteering, sky-high prices, malicious hype, and unfair competition. Effective supervision of capital should be strengthened in accordance with the law. The socialist market economy is an economy ruled by law, and capital activities must be carried out in accordance with the law. To curb the disorderly expansion of capital, it is not the absence of capital, but the orderly development of capital. Relevant laws and regulations that are not perfect should be improved as soon as possible, and those with existing laws and regulations should be strictly enforced and supervised. To support and guide the healthy development of capital norms. It is necessary to uphold and improve the basic socialist economic system, unswervingly consolidate and develop the public economy, unswervingly encourage, support, and guide the development of the non-public economy, and promote the healthy development of the non-public economy and the healthy growth of people in the non-public economy."
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,"Qiushi , Xi Jinping","May 15, 2022","The third issue: correctly understand and grasp the supply guarantee of primary products. For a big country like ours, ensuring the supply of primary products is a major strategic issue. It is necessary to strengthen strategic planning and make early adjustments to ensure supply security."
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,"Qiushi , Xi Jinping","May 15, 2022","Saving must be a priority. “If you take something and use it sparingly, you will be rich; if you take something without control and use it improperly, you will be poor.” 5 It is necessary to implement a comprehensive conservation strategy and promote conservation actions in various fields. In the field of production, it is necessary to promote the comprehensive conservation, intensive and circular utilization of resources, reduce the energy consumption and material consumption per unit of product, speed up the technological transformation of the manufacturing industry, and improve the efficiency of input and output. In the field of consumption, it is necessary to enhance the consciousness of saving for the entire population, advocate a simple, moderate, green and low-carbon lifestyle, oppose extravagance, waste and excessive consumption, carry out in-depth food saving initiatives, such as the “Empty Plate” initiative, and extensively carry out the creation of green institutions, green families, green communities, green travel and other actions."

It is necessary to intensify exploration efforts, implement a new round of strategic actions for ore prospecting breakthroughs, and improve the level of development and protection of marine resources and mineral resources. It is necessary to clarify the strategic bottom line of self-sufficiency in domestic production of important energy resources, give full play to the supporting role of state-owned enterprises, and accelerate the development and application of advanced extraction technologies for oil and gas and other resources. It is necessary to strengthen the construction of the national strategic material reserve system and play a role in regulating the bottom line at critical moments. It is necessary to promote garbage classification and recycling, expand the use of domestic solid waste, and speed up the construction of a waste recycling system."
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,"Qiushi , Xi Jinping","May 15, 2022","It is necessary to optimize the ability to guarantee overseas resources.

The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,"Qiushi , Xi Jinping","May 15, 2022","Here, I would like to emphasize the security of agricultural product supply. According to the latest land survey results, the area of arable land is still decreasing, and the basic farmland in some places does not grow food, fruit trees, or other high value-added crops. I have repeatedly said that Chinese people’s rice bowls should be firmly in their hands at all times, and our rice bowls should mainly contain Chinese grains. It is necessary to put the improvement of comprehensive agricultural production capacity in a more prominent position, continue to promote the construction of high-standard farmland, deeply implement the revitalization of the seed industry, improve the level of agricultural machinery and equipment, ensure the reasonable income of farmers who grow grain, ensure the absolute safety of grain rations and the basic self-sufficiency of grain, and improve the production and self-sufficiency of oil and soybeans."
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,"Qiushi , Xi Jinping","May 15, 2022","The fourth issue: correctly understand and grasp the prevention and resolution of major risks. Since the 1990s, China has effectively dealt with major challenges such as the Asian financial crisis, the international financial crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic. At present, there are many hidden risks in China’s economic and financial fields, but they are generally controllable. Stick to bottom-line thinking. The ancients said: “When disasters start to happen, you want to be like Du Qimeng.” We must give full play to the party’s leadership and the advantages of our socialist system in order to avoid large risks and crises."
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,"Qiushi , Xi Jinping","May 15, 2022","In the previous stage, we effectively dealt with shadow banking risks and Internet financial risks. At the same time, we must also see that new risks are still occurring, and the “black swan” and “gray rhino” incidents continue to occur. 6 There are several important reasons for analyzing these phenomena. One is the result of long-term accumulation. The impact of the “three-phase superposition” is not over yet, and the early risks still need to be digested. The second is regulatory capacity and institutional deficiencies. Serious oversight of corporate governance of financial institutions, and unsuitable financial supervision capabilities and levels. The management of local debts has been lax, and some localities have disguised and illegally borrowed, and the debt burden has continued to increase. The third is the barbaric behavior of the borrower. Some large enterprises are blindly impulsive, irrational diversification, excessive reliance on financial leverage, and excessive industrial capital entering the financial industry. Some shareholders and actual controllers operate and manage financial enterprises in violation of laws and regulations, with insider control, manipulation by major shareholders, financial fraud, and wanton misappropriation of funds. Fourth, collusion and corruption between officials and businessmen is rampant. The heads of some financial institutions and government officials are derelict of duty, corrupt, enriching their own pockets, and relying on the generosity of the country, resulting in heavy losses. Fifth, there are changes in the economic cycle. The slowdown in economic growth has brought to light all kinds of risks that were originally hidden, and the probability of local risks causing systemic risks has increased. Additionally, the risks characterized by corporate insolvency are prominent."
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,"Qiushi , Xi Jinping","May 15, 2022","In the next step, we must continue to follow the basic policy of stabilizing the overall situation, making plans, implementing policies by category, and do a good job in risk disposal. It is necessary to comply with laws and regulations, strengthen the construction of the financial rule of law, and explore the establishment of a regular law revision system. It is necessary to consolidate responsibilities with everyone “holding their own”, consolidate local party and government responsibilities, be responsible for territorial stability maintenance and defuse risks; consolidate the responsibilities of financial supervision, industry supervisors, discipline inspection and supervision departments, and promote risk resolution according to their respective responsibilities. We must also realize the main responsibility of enterprises for self-rescue, and formulate feasible risk resolution plans. It is necessary to strengthen capacity building, improve the level of regulatory technology, make up for regulatory shortcomings, and strengthen the construction of financial regulatory cadres. We must have sufficient resources, promptly set up a financial stability guarantee fund, give full play to the role of the deposit insurance system and guarantee funds in risk disposal, and study and formulate support policies for promoting mergers and acquisitions of financial institutions and resolving non-performing assets. Local governments should take the initiative to revitalize existing assets and defuse risks. Corporate shareholders must first bear the risk of loss until the share capital is cleared. It is necessary for all parties to cooperate extensively, and the financial industry should establish an integrated risk disposal mechanism, fully authorize, coordinate and improve the ability of cross-market and cross-industry coordination."

The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,"Qiushi , Xi Jinping","May 15, 2022","The fifth issue: correct understanding and grasp of carbon neutralization. Promoting carbon neutrality is a major strategic decision made by the Party Central Committee after careful consideration. It is our solemn commitment to the international community and an inherent requirement for promoting high-quality development. Recently, some problems have arisen in practical work, some are engaged in “carbon charge”, some are engaged in “one size fits all”, sports “carbon reduction”, and even the phenomenon of “power cut off”, all of which do not meet the requirements of the Party Central Committee. Green and low-carbon development is a complex project and a long-term task for the comprehensive transformation of economic and social development. The adjustment of energy structure and industrial structure cannot be accomplished overnight, let alone divorced from reality. If the gradual withdrawal of traditional energy is not based on a safe and reliable alternative to new energy, it will have an impact on economic development and social stability. Pollution reduction and carbon reduction are an integral part of economic restructuring."
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,"Qiushi , Xi Jinping","May 15, 2022","At the ninth meeting of the Central Financial and Economic Commission, I made a comprehensive deployment of the “dual carbon” work, emphasizing that we must adhere to the principles of national overall planning, conservation priority, two-wheel drive, smooth internal and external, and risk prevention. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has issued opinions on the carbon neutralization work and approved the carbon peaking action plan. Achieving the goal of reaching the peak and carbon neutrality must be firm, but it cannot be accomplished in one go. To be based on national conditions, it is our basic national conditions to focus on coal, and the realization of carbon peaking must be based on this reality. While doing a good job in the clean and efficient utilization of coal, speed up the flexible transformation of coal-fired power units, develop renewable energy, promote the optimal combination of coal and new energy, and increase the consumption capacity of new energy. We must pay close attention to tackling key green and low-carbon technologies and accelerate the promotion and application of advanced technologies. It is necessary to conduct scientific assessments, improve the “dual control” system of energy consumption, create conditions to realize the transition from “dual control” of energy consumption to “dual control” 7 of total carbon emissions and intensity, and accelerate the formation of an incentive and restraint mechanism for reducing pollution and carbon emissions. Relevant departments in all regions should coordinate the work of “dual control” and “dual carbon” to prevent simple decomposition. To ensure energy supply, achieve multi-objective balance, and increase energy supply through multiple channels, large enterprises, especially state-owned enterprises, must take the lead in ensuring supply and stable prices, and will never allow major incidents such as large-scale “power outages” to occur again. It is necessary to further promote the energy revolution, promote energy consumption, supply, technology, and institutional reforms, strengthen international cooperation, and accelerate the construction of an energy powerhouse."
The Deep-Seated Causes Behind the Russia-Ukraine Conflict and Its Effects,"China Social Sciences Network , Liu Jun","Mar 1, 2022","Today, the Ukraine conflict has attracted the world’s attention. Ukrainians and Russians all belonging to the same Slav nationality, why this taking up of arms against each other. There is a series of deep-seated causes behind it."
The Deep-Seated Causes Behind the Russia-Ukraine Conflict and Its Effects,"China Social Sciences Network , Liu Jun","Mar 1, 2022","The conflict in Ukraine is a concentrated manifestation of the development and worsening of the contradictions in bilateral relations between Russia and Ukraine since the crisis in Ukraine in 2014. The crisis in Ukraine in 2014 initiated the process of deterioration of bilateral relations between Russia and Ukraine, especially after the referendum in Crimea on integration into Russia, which kept the two countries in a state of hostility over a long period. This was coupled with the secessionist tendencies in the eastern part of Ukraine and Russia’s support for the two “republics” in eastern Ukraine, which deepened the military confrontation on the Russian-Ukrainian border. These were all a prelude and rehearsal for the outbreak of today’s Russia-Ukraine conflict. The core of the Russia-Ukraine conflict lies in three issues: First, the issue of Ukraine’s NATO membership. Second, the issue of territorial disputes in Crimea and the independence of the eastern part of the country. Third, the issue of Russia’s security claims. Ukraine has been seeking to join NATO since the time of its second president, Leonid Kuchma [July 1994 to January 2005], and now NATO membership has been written into the Ukrainian Constitution. Ukraine believes that only NATO membership can guarantee national sovereignty and prevent the Russian threat. Ukraine’s active demand for NATO membership is strongly opposed by Russia, and the game of eastward expansion and counter-eastward expansion between the two sides has become a focal point of conflict. For Russia, Ukraine, a country of geostrategic importance in the Soviet Union, joining NATO would be a direct threat to Russian security. In the face of NATO’s continuous eastward expansion after the Cold War, Russia wants to have enough of a strategic buffer zone on its western border, and thus, Russia will not agree to Ukraine’s joining NATO no matter what. In addition, the Crimea issue has been a major problem between Russia and Ukraine from the start. Ukraine has never given up its territorial claims to Crimea and strongly opposes the independence of the two “republics” in the east of the country. Russia is worried that Ukraine will use NATO’s collective defense force to try to take back Crimea and increase its offensive efforts in the east of the country after joining NATO, so it has preempted Ukraine by first recognizing the independence of the two eastern Ukraine “republics,” and then implementing a special military operation to force Ukraine to surrender, promote peace through war, and thereby achieve its strategic goals."
The Deep-Seated Causes Behind the Russia-Ukraine Conflict and Its Effects,"China Social Sciences Network , Liu Jun","Mar 1, 2022","The United States and NATO must bear responsibility for the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. This conflict is also the inevitable result of the long-term squeezing of Russia’s security space by the United States and NATO. Viewed externally, the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict is also the result of the United States and NATO adding fuel to the fire with their long-term push to undermine and weaken Russia, and reflects the long-standing historical grievances between Russia and the United States and NATO. In the three decades since the end of the Cold War, except for a brief honeymoon period, Russia-United States relations have basically developed against a background of constant confrontation. After the 2014 Ukraine crisis, Russia-U.S. relations have moved toward spiraling hostility. Political denigration, diplomatic expulsions, economic sanctions, military confrontation, sanctions and counter-sanctions, containment and counter-containment, and deterrence and counter-deterrence are the norm in the development of Russia-U.S. relations. In the framework of great power competition and confrontation between Russia and the United States, Ukraine is a pawn of the United States and the West for confronting Russia, and a large amount of U.S. and NATO military aid and economic aid, including offensive weapons, have entered Ukraine. NATO follows the U.S. policy of undermining and weakening Russia and carries out military deterrence and front-line confrontation against Russia, which greatly threatens Russia’s security interests. Overall, the negative role of the United States and NATO in the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict is reflected in three ways: First, irritating Russia’s sensitive security nerves. Second, supporting Ukraine against Russia. Third, artificially promoting the escalation of tensions and indirectly promoting the outbreak of conflict. Russia is a country that is particularly sensitive to security issues. Historically, its location on the vast plains of Eastern Europe has allowed both Eastern nomads and Western colonizers to drive straight in. Since Peter the Great, it has been pursuing access to the sea, pioneering frontiers, and opening up new territory, creating a vast space for Russia. However, this vastness breeds insecurity, which in turn drives Russia to again look for more space, and Russians are therefore inherently insecure. After the end of the Cold War, Russia generally believed that the West had promised that NATO would not expand eastward, but five consecutive rounds of expansion, with 11 Central and Eastern European and former Soviet countries joining NATO and military fronts deployed closer to Russia, have greatly irritated Russia’s nerves. Since Biden came into office, he has reintegrated the transatlantic alliance, counteracted Russia through NATO collectively, and conducted forward confrontation through a series of military exercises, with the threat and shadow of conflict always present. In addition, the United States and NATO also took advantage of Ukraine’s eager desire to join NATO to support Ukraine against Russia. Before the outbreak of the conflict, a large amount of military equipment and offensive weapons entered Ukraine. At the same time, they also directly deployed military forces in the territory of NATO member states in Eastern Europe, and also deliberately created rumors of conflict to artificially raise tensions and indirectly promote the outbreak of conflict."
The Deep-Seated Causes Behind the Russia-Ukraine Conflict and Its Effects,"China Social Sciences Network , Liu Jun","Mar 1, 2022","The outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict will not only have a profound impact on the European security structure and Eurasian geopolitics, but will also reshape the global geopolitical landscape to a certain degree. The Russia-Ukraine conflict will bring about fundamental changes in the European security landscape and structure, and make the geopolitics of the Eurasian region move toward a return of the Cold War. After the end of the Cold War, a new problem for the European security structure based on the United States control of European security affairs was how to assure Russia’s security demands. The common European homeland that began to be advocated toward the end of Soviet Union—a Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals—was obviously only a utopian fantasy, and not only was it impossible for Russia to integrate into the original European security system, but it was gradually excluded. That is, in Russia’s view, Europe’s security is divided security, the security of the United States and NATO is based on Russia’s insecurity, and Russia’s security concerns have not taken seriously for a long time. Therefore, the Russia-Ukraine conflict is a general outbreak of Russia’s security contradictions with the United States and NATO have intensified to a certain extent, and signifies a return of Eurasian geopolitics to the Cold War. The outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict will also have a profound impact on global geopolitics. Russia-U.S. relations in particular will see the most fundamental changes since the end of the Cold War. The original dialogue mechanisms between Russia and the United States will all cease, and the unprecedented U.S. sanctions against Russia, including kicking Russia out of SWIFT and the sanctions against President Putin personally, plunge Russia-U.S. relations into a state of mutual hostility for a long time."

The Epochal Value of the Global Security Initiative Surpasses the Traditional Western Security Outlook,"Contemporary World , Tian Wenlin","May 16, 2022","Since the modern era, Western powers have increasingly become the dominant powers ruling the world by virtue of their first-mover advantages in the military and economic fields. From the perspective of security, the history of the world under Western dominance is one of constant and unrelenting war and conflict. In his book Krieg und Kapitalismus (War and Capitalism), German sociologist Werner Sombart pointed out that, between the 14th and 15th centuries, England and France were at war for 100 years; in the 16th century, Europe had only 25 years of peace, and in the 17th century this number fell to 21 years. That is to say, in these two hundred years, 154 years were years of war. The Netherlands was at war for 116 of the 145 years from 1568 to 1713. In the book The Sources of Social Power, the British scholar Michael Mann pointed out that for three-quarters of the time from 1494 to 1975, European powers were staging wars and the time free from war did not surpass 25 years. By contrast, East Asia enjoyed 300 years of peace between 1590 and 1894, with only a few relatively small bilateral wars. Obviously, compared with the other regions of the world (at least compared to East Asia), the world dominated by Western powers has been filled with wars and conflicts. In the process of foreign conquest, the Western powers became more aggressive and eager to resort to war and violence, ultimately creating a savage and bloody hierarchical world system with the “law of the jungle” as its underpinning."
The Epochal Value of the Global Security Initiative Surpasses the Traditional Western Security Outlook,"Contemporary World , Tian Wenlin","May 16, 2022","On the surface, the Western powers have maintained their dominant position in world politics for hundreds of years by virtue of their military superiority and foreign conquests. However, the ubiquitous zero-sum games and military conflicts have forced human society as a whole to suffer incalculable disasters and losses. According to statistics, between 1871 and 1914, Britain fought 30 colonial wars. During this period, Britain, France, and the Netherlands fought at least 100 wars. These colonial wars caused the deaths of 280,000 to 300,000 Europeans, while up to 50–60 million people from the colonized areas lost their lives."
The Epochal Value of the Global Security Initiative Surpasses the Traditional Western Security Outlook,"Contemporary World , Tian Wenlin","May 16, 2022","In the end, enamored with using war to solve problems, the Western powers also sank themselves to a dangerous self-destructive position. World War I was a worldwide war waged by imperialist countries to redefine their spheres of influence. In this war, casualties at the Battle of the Somme alone exceeded 1.3 million. During World War I, millions of young men in Europe died on the battlefield, and many of the achievements of human civilization were destroyed in the war. After witnessing firsthand the scenes of this self-destructive war in the Western world, the German scholar Spengler completed his book The Decline of the West, and pessimistically predicted that Western civilization was on the decline."
The Epochal Value of the Global Security Initiative Surpasses the Traditional Western Security Outlook,"Contemporary World , Tian Wenlin","May 16, 2022","World War II was, to a certain extent, a continuation of World War I. The level of industrialization was changing with each passing day, driving unprecedented increases in the lethality and destructiveness of various weapons of war. As a result, the catastrophe caused to human society by World War II was far greater than that of World War I. In 1945, at the end of World War II, Germany’s gross domestic product fell to its 1890 level, and Britain went from being a creditor to a debtor nation. From 1946 to 1947, about 100 million Europeans had to subsist on rations of 1,500 kcal per day. Facts tell us that relying on war to achieve hegemonic goals is ultimately counterproductive. As the ancient Roman scholar Cicero said: “Most people think that the achievements of war are more important than those of peace; but this opinion needs to be corrected.”"

During the 50-year Cold War, despite the saber-rattling between the United States and the Soviet Union, both sides exercised restraint. This gave rise to a rare intermission between wars throughout the world. The U.S.-Soviet Cold War was to some extent a “cold peace.”"

The five local wars that broke out after the Cold War (the Gulf War, Kosovo War, Afghanistan War, Iraq War, and Libyan War) were all initiated or led by the United States. At the same time, the United States has continued to intensify its encirclement and containment of China and Russia. In 1989, Deng Xiaoping said: “I hoped that the Cold War would come to an end. But I’m disappointed now. It looks possible that one Cold War has ended and two more have begun, with one directed against the Global South, or the Third World, and the other against socialism.” According to public information such as that from the U.S. Congressional Record and the Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress, during the 111 years from 1890 to 2001, the United States initiated 133 military interventions."
The Epochal Value of the Global Security Initiative Surpasses the Traditional Western Security Outlook,"Contemporary World , Tian Wenlin","May 16, 2022","In recent years, the transfer of power among major countries has accelerated, and the world has begun to experience great changes unseen in a century. On the one hand, the relative decline of Western countries led by the United States is apparent. The financialization and hollowing out of its economy have caused the United States to show indications of a transition from prosperity to decline. At the same time, after the “9/11” incident, the United States launched the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq in quick succession, leading to the accelerated decline of its soft and hard power. On the other hand, the rise of emerging economies represented by China is apparent. Historical experience shows that periods of power transfer are often also periods of frequent geopolitical contradictions. The Italian historian Giovanni Arrighi argues that capital accumulation is positively correlated with war. Since the rise of capitalism, we have gone through at least three cycles of accumulation. Each shift in the cycle of capital accumulation (actually a transfer of power) is ultimately resolved through large-scale war. In the eyes of the United States and other Western powers, power is the ability to force other countries to act according to their own will. This determines the scarcity and exclusivity of hegemony. The United States will never allow any country to attain a position of equality with itself, so it has continuously increased its efforts to encircle and contain emerging powers such as China and Russia."

Fundamentally, the Russia-Ukraine conflict is of a hegemonic and anti-hegemonic nature and is also a battle between the old and new systems in the bigger context of an international power transfer. After the conflict broke out, the United States and other Western countries constantly fanned the flames, using the provision of military aid to Ukraine and the staging of a “proxy war,” with the aim of prolonging the war as long as possible to profit from it."

Security is the precondition and foundation of development. A stable and peaceful international environment is conducive to all countries promoting their economic prosperity and social development, thus forming a virtuous circle where security and development promote each other. On the contrary, a poor security situation will greatly damage local business environments; high military expenditures will directly squeeze out investment in fields related to the people’s wellbeing; and regional conflicts and local wars will leave each of the warring countries crippled and reverse economic gains made over many years. In addition, a lag in development will exacerbate political instability and regional turmoil, causing countries to fall into a vicious circle of “the more chaotic, the poorer—the poorer, the more chaotic.” As they say, “well-governed countries are generally rich, while chaotic countries are generally poor.”"

As a result, the breakup of the originally highly integrated world political and economic landscape has accelerated, potential contradictions and uncertain factors continue to emerge, and imbalances, disorder, and anomie in various fields have intensified on a global scale. A series of dangerous trends have emerged in the current world landscape, such as intensifying contradictions between major countries, the emergence of political camps, economic fragmentation, security self-help, and values-based confrontations. Once these long-accumulating contradictions pass the breaking point, it may be that there are unanticipated large-scale wars and conflicts. As Chairman Xi Jinping has said: “The themes of the era of peace and development are facing serious challenges, and the world is neither peaceful nor tranquil.” If we are to eliminate the root causes of war and build a better world, we must find a new security framework that embodies a new concept of governance."

The Epochal Value of the Global Security Initiative Surpasses the Traditional Western Security Outlook,"Contemporary World , Tian Wenlin","May 16, 2022","The frequent occurrence of wars and conflicts in the international system dominated by the West is directly related to the politics of strength in which Western countries believe. The values of power politics are deeply rooted in the history and thought of Western countries. The Western academic classic History of the Peloponnesian War records a negotiation between the Athenians and the Melians. The Athenians, having the upper hand, summed up the situation frankly: “The strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.” These remarks express fully the hegemonic mentality of Western countries to use strength to take advantage of the weak. Their admiration for force means that Europeans in their interactions with non-Western countries often use military might as their main reference point for evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of non-Western nations."
The Epochal Value of the Global Security Initiative Surpasses the Traditional Western Security Outlook,"Contemporary World , Tian Wenlin","May 16, 2022","Realism is the most popular and accepted theory of international relations in modern Western countries. This theory views the international community as being in a state of anarchy, with countries having a strong sense that they are responsible for their own security and pursuing the maximization of their own interests motivated by fear, interest, or prestige. In the view of Western realist theorists, the pursuit of survival and power is the ultimate goal of a state’s existence. Hans Morgenthau, a representative of classical realism, believes that the goal of competition among nations is to compete for power, maintain power, and display power. In Man, the State, and War: A Theoretical Analysis, Kenneth Waltz, a well-known scholar of neorealism, holds that the origin of force lies in international anarchy. The root causes of war can be generalized into three situations: defects of human nature, defects of the state, and defects of international society (anarchy). Meanwhile, the offensive realism that has emerged in recent years, while advocating the pursuit of power, is also developing more aggressive policy propositions. This is especially true of neoconservatism in the United States. Theory itself is not politics, but once the theory is embodied in national policy, it will have a massive influence on real-world politics. To a certain extent, it is precisely because of the widespread adoption of various specious Western theoretical propositions that the international security dilemma continues to worsen, making today’s world a “defective world” (坏世界) in which the few benefit and the many suffer."

The problem is that the world has always been an organic whole, and states are only parts of this organic whole. Chairman Xi Jinping has pointed out: “Today, the development of the international community has become a complex, delicate, and organic machine. Tearing down one part will cause the running of the whole machine to face serious difficulties, and both the torn down and those who do the tearing will suffer.” From the perspective of the whole and the system, the whole is greater than the part. The more that countries coordinate and cooperate as parts of a whole, the more the world as a whole can continue to improve, leading to the formation of a “good world” (好世界)."

The world today faces two very different governance concepts and paths to choose from: one is the old security outlook that adheres to the stubborn Western zero-sum game and Cold War mentality, takes power politics and military force as its code of conduct, and accepts group confrontation and sacrificing the security of other countries in exchange for one’s own so-called absolute security; the other is a new security outlook based on the values of common interests and a globalist perspective, emphasizing fairness and reasonableness, joint contribution and sharing, political negotiation, and mutual respect. The facts show that the old security concept long practiced by Western countries has increasingly constricted the development path of human society, causing the whole world to become less and less secure.

From the perspective of philosophical thinking, Chinese civilization emphasizes dialectical thinking, understands the complex interplay of good and bad, and mutual transformation through contradiction. As a result, it seldom goes to extremes and opposes either-or thinking and the deeply metaphysical Cold War mindset. In inter-state exchanges, in contrast to Western values’ domineering practices of being quick to impose on others, Chinese civilization advocates “do not impose on others what you do not wish for yourself” and emphasizes inclusiveness. In terms of the notion of security, Chinese civilization has a strong awareness that “the world is one family” and advocates a shared, comprehensive, cooperative, and sustainable security concept, which is at a far higher level than the “winner takes all” values of Western civilization. As a socialist country, China emphasizes the spirit of internationalism and advocates equal respect and peaceful coexistence with other countries (especially developing countries). The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by China are a typical manifestation of major country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics, and the Global Security Initiative is an organic component of this theoretical system."

Marx once pointed out: “Capital is the economic power that dominates everything in bourgeois society. It must form both the point of departure and the conclusion.” “If turbulence and strife will bring a profit, it will freely encourage both.” As long as the capitalist system based on private ownership exists, imperialist wars with capital accumulation as their ultimate goal are inevitable. Looking at world history and the current reality, the capital accumulation of Western countries is often accomplished through hegemonic means, and hegemonism and power politics are still the direct causes that exacerbate the current global security dilemma.

Expanding the middle-income population and improving the pattern of income distribution are the keys to achieving substantial progress in promoting common prosperity. Since reform and opening up, the Party and the state have always regarded expanding the middle-income population to be the top priority for improving income distribution and have made clear strategic deployments. The 16th Party Congress proposed that “with the goal of common prosperity, we must expand the proportion of middle-income people and raise the income level of low-income people,” revealing the important relationship between expanding the consumption of the middle-income population and economic development. The 17th Party Congress pointed out that “we must basically form a rational and orderly income distribution pattern, with the middle-income population in the majority,” linking the expansion of the middle-income population with the improvement of the income distribution pattern. The Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee proposed that we must “work hard to narrow the income distribution gap between urban and rural areas, regions, and industries, and gradually form an olive-shaped distribution pattern.” The 19th Party Congress further raised the expansion of the middle-income population to the level of development strategy and raised the “middle-income population ratio” to become the first stage goal of the “two-step” development strategy for the period from 2020 to the middle of this century, indicating that the Party Central Committee attaches great importance to expanding the middle-income group. The Fourth Plenum of the 19th Central Committee reiterated that it is necessary to regulate the order of income distribution to “protect legal incomes, increase the income of low-income people, expand the middle-income population, regulate excessive incomes, clean up and regulate hidden incomes, and ban illegal incomes.” In 2021, the 10th meeting of the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission more clearly proposed that we must “reasonably regulate high incomes, ban illegal incomes, form an olive-shaped distribution structure with a large middle and two small ends, promote social fairness and justice, promote the all-round development of the people, and make solid progress towards the goal of common prosperity for all the people.” This is actually an important sign of the expansion of the middle-income population and the formation of an olive-shaped distribution pattern for common prosperity. On the basis of adhering to China’s basic socialist economic system, expanding the middle-income population is in line with the basic direction of China’s economic and social development and will help accelerate the realization of the strategic goal of common prosperity."

The report calculated the average marginal propensity to consume of high-, middle-, and low-income families from 2010 to 2018 as 0.45, 0.71, and 0.37, respectively. That is to say that middle-income families have the highest average marginal propensity to consume, significantly higher than the other two types of families. Therefore, under the premise of stable income growth, expanding the proportion of the middle-income population can release greater consumption potential and add-on effects. A more specific analysis found that the service consumption characteristics of the middle-income population were more obvious. It is the main force for medium and high-end goods demands and service consumption in fields such as education, medical care, leisure, and tourism. It can exert great social consumption potential and stimulate social employment growth and economic development. Among these features, the middle-income population has a greater demand for education and training, and the demand and consumption of education is also an investment in human capital. This will better promote the formation and increase of human capital throughout the whole society, thereby promoting the development of science and technology (S&T) and the improvement of labor productivity, fundamentally promoting high-quality economic development, and consolidating the material foundation for common prosperity."

In this, the “olive type” benign social distribution pattern praised by academia and policy research circles has the basic characteristics of being large in the middle and small at both ends. This means the middle-income population accounts for the majority, and the poor and high-income wealthy populations are minorities. In this distribution pattern, most people share the fruits of development. However, our research found that the current distribution pattern in China is not directly shifting to an olive type but is changing from a pyramid type to a gourd type."

It is still far from the requirements of an olive-shaped distribution, and there is still a lot of room for improvement, such as the fact that the proportion of the low-income population is still too large. Therefore, in social and economic development, more attention should be paid to raising the income level of the low-income population to the middle-income level, so as to effectively expand the scale of the middle-income population. This will directly promote the improvement of China’s income distribution pattern so that it will gradually approach the typical olive-shaped distribution pattern and eventually accelerate the transformation to the ideal olive-shaped pattern."

The Focus and Difficulties of Expanding the Middle-income Population are in Rural Areas,"Governance , Chen Zongsheng , Yang Xilei","Feb 14, 2022","The middle-income population usually has a stable and abundant income base, relatively high social status, relatively fair development opportunities, and relatively stable life. In a certain sense, it is often representative of mainstream social values and the cornerstone of social stability and development. Therefore, when most members of society enter the middle layer of society and form an olive-shaped society, it indicates that the process of economic development has entered a sustainable state, and the social order has entered a relatively stable state. In this way, a good social environment can be formed for solidly promoting the sustainable and stable development of the society and economy and ultimately achieving common prosperity. In the process of the economic transformation and development of an economy from a low-income stage to a middle-income stage and then to a high-income stage, the gradual expansion of the middle-income population can effectively alleviate some potential unstable factors caused by the adjustment of interest patterns and the change of values, relieve the class antagonism caused by the gap between the rich and the poor, and contribute to social stability. In short, the constant increase in the middle-income population means that the poor population will gradually account for a minority, the income gap between groups will gradually narrow, and equitable social and economic development will ultimately be achieved."

The Focus and Difficulties of Expanding the Middle-income Population are in Rural Areas,"Governance , Chen Zongsheng , Yang Xilei","Feb 14, 2022","The income distribution pattern in China is still a gourd-shaped pattern with a relatively small middle-income population, which is far removed from the target olive-shaped distribution pattern. Expanding the size of the middle-income population is of great significance. This requires us to give more accurate descriptions and characterizations in terms of concepts and measurements. Based on previous research, we believe that the middle-income population cannot be completely and simply equated with the middle-income class or the middle class. These concepts are related but distinct. Among them, terms such as middle-income class or middle class more often reflect changes in occupational structure and social structure. They are mainly measured using occupational indicators or identity standards. For example, in developed countries, many professionals, such as lawyers and accountants, are often considered to belong to the middle class or middle-income class, but workers or proprietors are generally not considered to be middle class, even if their income is high. This shows us that “class” is a concept that emphasizes sociology significance. Relatively speaking, the middle-income population generally refers to a group in a country and society/economy that is measured and calculated according to a unified income level. Compared with high-income people and poor people, their income level is in the middle level of the overall population or around the intermediate level. In other words, a single income indicator is used for measurement. This measures and reflects the differences in the proportions of the population corresponding to certain income standards. Therefore, the middle-income population mainly reflects the changes in the income distribution pattern among all residents. The expansion of the middle-income population represents a general increase in the income level, an increase in spending power, and an improvement in the income distribution gap among the majority of residents. This is a necessary condition for the formation of an ideal olive-shaped distribution pattern. Therefore, it is a concept that emphasizes economic significance. It is true that the concepts of economics and sociology have differences as well as overlaps and connections, but this article believes that in most cases in the current context of China, the economic concept of the middle-income population is better able to reflect the actual situation."
The Focus and Difficulties of Expanding the Middle-income Population are in Rural Areas,"Governance , Chen Zongsheng , Yang Xilei","Feb 14, 2022","In addition, domestic and foreign academic circles also have different measurement standards for the middle-income population. Therefore, the results obtained by different scholars and research institutions vary significantly. In general, the more common definition methods include absolute and relative standards. An “absolute standard” refers to the use of absolute indicators such as income or expenditure to define the middle-income population. For example, the World Bank defines the middle-income standard as a per capita (adult) daily income of 10-100 U.S. dollars. Converted into RMB at the exchange rate of 1:7, this is 25,000-250,000 RMB per year. However, based on per capita disposable income of 22,000-65,000 RMB, the research group of the Institute of Social Development of China’s National Development and Reform Commission calculated that the middle-income population in China increased from 1.62 percent in 2000 to 21.25 percent in 2010. The proportion of the urban middle-income population was about 36.78 percent, and the proportion of the rural middle-income population was about 5.75 percent. In addition, the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics used an annual average household income of 100,000 to 500,000 RMB as its standard and estimated that, in 2017, there were about 140 million households in China and a total of 400 million people meeting the standard, accounting for about 28.6 percent of the country’s total population. This is the source for the claim that there are about 400 million people in China’s middle-income population that the media has often mentioned in recent years. Aside from the factor of different measurement years, we can still see that the measurement standards and results are quite different."
The Focus and Difficulties of Expanding the Middle-income Population are in Rural Areas,"Governance , Chen Zongsheng , Yang Xilei","Feb 14, 2022","A “relative standard” refers to setting the upper and lower percentiles around the median income of residents as the standard for the middle-income population. Since the median personal income changes every year, the middle-income range defined by relative standards also changes year by year. For example, some scholars define the 95th percentile of urban residents’ income as the upper limit of the middle-income population and the lower limit as the 25th percentile of urban residents’ income. According to this standard, the proportion of the urban middle-income population in China in 2006, 2008, 2011, and 2013 were 27 percent, 28 percent, 24 percent, and 25 percent, respectively, showing a general downward trend. Another scholar draws on the standard of 67 percent-200 percent of annual median income for more than 200 countries in the world for the upper and lower limits of the income standard of the Chinese middle-income population in the corresponding years.  In this method, the proportions of the Chinese middle-income population in 2007, 2013, and 2016 were 20.2 percent, 27.3 percent, and 28.9 percent, respectively, a gradual increase. This article prefers the relative standard adopted by most people in academia, using a fixed percentage of 100 percent to 200 percent of the annual median income of residents as the standard for defining the middle-income population. That is, 100 percent of the median is the lower limit of the middle-income population, and 200 percent of the median is the upper limit. According to this standard, for example, the median income of all residents in China in 2019 was 26,523 RMB, so the proportion of the overall middle-income population in China was 37.34 percent. Specifically, the proportion of middle-income people among urban residents was about 29.25 percent, and about 7.39 percent in rural areas. This means that about 80.20 percent of the Chinese middle-income population is concentrated in urban areas. This reflects one aspect of the huge income gap between urban and rural residents in China."
The Focus and Difficulties of Expanding the Middle-income Population are in Rural Areas,"Governance , Chen Zongsheng , Yang Xilei","Feb 14, 2022","In general, no matter which standard is adopted or whether urban and rural areas are measured separately or together, the proportion of the middle-income population in China is still relatively low, although its development trend is gradually expanding. Therefore, when we comprehensively examine the changes in the proportions of the low-income population, high-income population, and middle-income population, that is, the changes in the proportion of the populations of all income groups, we can clearly find that after the income distribution pattern of Chinese residents changed from the “flying saucer” pattern at the beginning of reforms to the “pyramid shape,” it did not directly transition to the ideal “olive shape.” Instead, it gradually formed something similar to a “gourd shape,” consisting of one main and one secondary group, namely two income groups. The main group is composed of low-income people, and the secondary group is composed of middle-income people. This is different from the “pyramid shape” in which low-income people form the majority group, and it is also different from the “olive shape” in which the middle-income population is the majority group. The “gourd-shaped” pattern is the result of the development of the middle-income population, but also its insufficient development. That is to say, with the gradual improvement of the economic development level and the new phenomena derived from it, the gourd-shape low-income “main group” has shrunk compared with the pyramid-shape pattern, so that a “secondary group” appears at the middle-income level. This is the basic feature of China’s current distribution pattern of resident income. Obviously, such a “gourd-shaped” pattern is still far from the ideal “olive-shaped” pattern, which highlights the fact that the proportion of the middle-income population is still too small in general. If we stall in this state, we risk falling into the “middle-income trap.” According to the experience and theoretical conclusions from developed economies, only when the proportion of the middle-income population reaches more than 50 percent can a more reasonable “olive-shaped” distribution pattern and social structure be formed. We can see that continuing to work hard to expand the middle-income population is an important task for China going forward in the new stage of development."

The main contradiction in the large urban-rural gap is not that the income of urban residents is too high, but that the scale of the rural low-income population is too large, that is, the income of rural residents is generally too low. Therefore, the difficulty and focus of expanding the middle-income population in China in the future lie in continuously improving the income level of rural residents as a whole in the process of rural revitalization and reducing the proportion of the low-income population, thereby expanding the middle-income population in the country. 2"
The Focus and Difficulties of Expanding the Middle-income Population are in Rural Areas,"Governance , Chen Zongsheng , Yang Xilei","Feb 14, 2022","First of all, the gap between urban and rural areas in China is still too large. After decades of urban-oriented development, the rural economy has become the main contradiction in the “unbalanced and insufficient” social development in China, and the income distribution of urban and rural residents has been in a state of unfairness for a long time. First, the gap between urban and rural areas in China’s provinces has generally been excessively large for a long time. In 2013, the average urban-rural income ratio of 31 provinces and municipalities nationwide was 2.81. The highest was 3.56 in Gansu Province, six provinces and autonomous regions had income ratios greater than 3, and 24 provinces and municipalities had an income ratio between 2 and 3. By 2019, the national average was 2.64. Gansu still had the highest ratio at 3.36, Yunan, Guizhou, and Gansu had ratios greater than 3, and 27 provinces and municipalities had ratios in the 2-3 range. The urban-rural income ratios in the most developed regions such as Beijing and Shanghai are also in the 2-3 range, which offers ample proof that the areas surrounding major Chinese cities are covered by rural low-income belts. Second, the gap between urban and rural areas in China has declined in recent years, but the decline is not large, and overall, the excessive gap is stable. After peaking at 3.33 in 2009, the average urban-rural income ratio only dropped to 2.64 by 2019. Third, the large urban-rural gap has led to a persistently large overall income gap in China. After 2000, China’s total Gini coefficient remained in the 0.4 to 0.5 range for a long time, which is recognized by the international academic community as too large. China’s international ranking is low. The breakdown analysis confirmed that the gap between urban and rural areas accounted for about 60 percent of the overall gap for a long time. Even in 2019, it still accounted for 54 percent. We can see that the main reason for the large gap between urban and rural areas in China is that the gap between urban and rural areas is too large, and narrowing the gap between urban and rural areas is also the primary task in achieving common prosperity (Chen Zongsheng and Yang Xilei, 2021)."
The Focus and Difficulties of Expanding the Middle-income Population are in Rural Areas,"Governance , Chen Zongsheng , Yang Xilei","Feb 14, 2022","Secondly, it should be noted that the “main contradiction” that produced the excessive gap between urban and rural areas in China lies in the relative lack of development in the vast rural areas and the slow growth in the income of rural residents. This is shown by the fact that, first, the low-income population with a per capita monthly income of less than 1,000 RMB is mainly distributed in rural areas. On May 28, 2020, when Premier Li Keqiang attended the press conference of the third session of the 13th National People’s Congress and answered questions from Chinese and foreign journalists, he pointed out that there are still “600 million people in the low- and middle-income populations in China, and their average monthly income is only about 1,000 RMB.” After careful screening and calculation, it is not only the case that “600 million people earn less than 1,000 RMB per month” in the current national condition but also that 400 million of them are rural residents. Second, the average income of rural residents is mostly lower than the national average. In 2019, the per capita disposable income of national residents was 30,733 RMB. In the same year, only the top 20 percent high-income population in rural areas was slightly above this level, while more than 80 percent of all people were lower than the national average. Third, the proportion of the income of rural residents in all strata as a share of the national average continued to decline from 2013 to mid-2019. Specifically, the lower the income of households, the greater the decline. The income share of 80 percent of farmers and 86 percent of the population decreased by varying degrees (Chen Zongsheng and Yang Xilei, 2021)."

Only by continuously and rapidly increasing the income of rural residents, accelerating the narrowing of the urban-rural gap, and gradually increasing the focus on the populous rural low-income population can we effectively reduce the proportion of the low-income population. Correspondingly, the scale of the Chinese middle-income population will be expanded, thereby promoting the transformation of the entire social income distribution from its current gourd-shaped structure to an olive-shaped structure."

This has resulted in a gourd-shaped distribution pattern, which is basically rooted in the constraints of the urban-rural dual system. This includes the constraints of the dual distribution system, but more importantly, it includes the constraints of the dual development system, that is, the result of the long-term one-sided implementation of the urban economic development orientation. Therefore, in the new development stage, we should gradually transition from an urban development orientation to a strategic focus that prioritizes rural revitalization and development. Moreover, such development is fair and balanced development. It is based on the premise of eliminating the income inequality between urban and rural residents and the unbalanced development of the dual economy. It can be said that only by eliminating the urban-rural dual system and realizing the unification of the dual economy can we effectively increase the income of rural residents, truly and effectively expand the proportion of the middle-income population, and substantially promote the common prosperity of all urban and rural people. To this end, we must make efforts in the following areas:"
The Focus and Difficulties of Expanding the Middle-income Population are in Rural Areas,"Governance , Chen Zongsheng , Yang Xilei","Feb 14, 2022","Accelerate the reform of the household registration points system and effectively promote new urbanization in the promotion of rural revitalization. Accelerating urbanization is the most effective means to reduce the rural low-income population and increase the middle-income population. Since reform and opening up, China’s rate of urbanization has increased at a rate of more than 1 percentage point per year for an extended period. As a result, a large number of rural people have been transferred to urban non-agricultural employment, thus shedding their low-income status. This rate seems to have declined in recent years. Since 2018, it has dropped to less than 1 percentage point per year, which has slowed down the decline of the rural low-income population. However, considering that China’s rural areas still account for 60 percent of the registered population, it still exceeds the demands of the agricultural industry. Among this population, 20 percent are so-called “migrant workers,” who have rural household registrations but actually live in cities as non-residents. Therefore, we must accelerate the reform of the household registration system and improve the current points system so as to promote the urbanization of rural residents. In addition to promoting the transfer of a portion of the low-income population who currently have rural residence permits (户口, hukou) to existing large, medium, and small cities, it is more important to promote the urbanization and modernization of the rural areas themselves, vigorously develop other non-agricultural industries such as the service industry and processing industry, promote the integrated development of the industry, urban space, and people (产、城、人) of small towns, and raise the income level of the rural population."

Since 2015, the proportion of labor wage income in the disposable income of rural residents has exceeded that of business operation income, becoming the largest source of income for rural residents. Its proportion should further increase in the future. An important factor that affects how rural residents, and especially the floating population, obtain wage income is the level of human capital. Therefore, the education and training of rural residents have become critical measures. Moreover, in order to further improve the human capital of the younger generation in rural areas in the future, we must direct more resources to the education of rural residents, improve the quality of education, and effectively promote the realization of equalization in basic compulsory education. In addition, strengthening the business training of the rural labor force and improving the employment skills of the rural labor force are also important steps."

In recent years, the effects of various policies oriented to “agricultural, farmer, and rural area” issues have continued to increase, and the labor income and business operating income of rural residents have continued to increase. These are the two main sources of income growth for farmers. In the future, we should actively promote supply-side structural reforms for agriculture, fully implement the policies and measures to support and benefit agriculture, accelerate the adjustment of the agricultural industry structure, cultivate a competitive modern agricultural economic crop industry system, cultivate famous products and distinctive industries with market competitiveness, promote the high-quality development of modern agriculture, and increase the proportion of income rural residents earn from business operations."

Currently, the proportion of rural residents’ property income is still at a relatively low level, and property income only accounts for 2.35 percent of the per capita disposable income of rural residents, much lower than the 10.37 percent of urban residents. The central government has repeatedly emphasized the need to increase residents’ property income and its share of total income. Therefore, we should continue to deepen the comprehensive reform of the rural system in the rural revitalization strategy and steadily promote the revitalization of idle homesteads and abandoned public welfare construction land so that it enters the market, and urban technology and capital. In combination with the technology and capital of cities and towns, we must revitalize the collective assets that are idle or inefficiently used by village collectives and explore more channels to increase the property income of rural residents."

Those countries that fail to cope with the challenge of slowing growth and that perform poorly in social development are often caught in a vicious cycle of stagnant economic growth and widening income gaps, preventing them from actually entering the ranks of high-income countries for a long time.

If the distribution pattern of the pie remains unchanged, the slowdown in the expansion of the pie means that sharing is weakened. China’s reality already displays this tendency. For example, since 2009, the Gini coefficient of resident income has seen several years of decline, from 0.491 in 2008 to 0.462 in 2015, before it began to increase again."

The convergence or conditional convergence hypothesis of neoclassical growth theory links the initial per capita income level to economic growth performance. It expects that, once the necessary endowments, institutions, infrastructure, and other conditions are in place, it will be possible for those countries at a lower stage of economic development to achieve faster economic growth than countries at a higher stage of development. In this way, convergence occurs between countries. However, such research does not pay particular attention to the differences in the growth patterns that countries at different stages of development follow to achieve economic growth.

Under normal circumstances, a country’s economic growth rate will accelerate the pace of its regression to the mean. When the speed at which the pie expands slows down, it becomes more important to divide the pie correctly. However, the very same reasons for the slowdown in growth also lead to the failure of the labor market’s primary distribution function and a decline in social mobility.

The result of this game further widens the income gap in some countries. However, this phenomenon also shows that this is a stage of development where we must pay attention to redistributive policies themselves and the appropriate choice of redistributive methods."
The Household Registration System Is a Major Challenge in Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Aisixiang , Cai Fang","Jun 19, 2020","Since reform and opening up, the achievements of China’s rapid economic growth have been widely shared, mainly through the mechanism of the labor market. The shared nature of this development and the mechanisms that made it possible are closely related to the specific development stage and type of development."
The Household Registration System Is a Major Challenge in Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Aisixiang , Cai Fang","Jun 19, 2020","As China’s 30-year demographic window of opportunity (1980-2010) rapidly closed, the most significant feature of the dual economic development stage, the infinite supply of labor, also seems to be disappearing. Specifically, as the transfer of surplus agricultural labor slows down, the expansion of urban and rural employment and the reallocation of resources are no longer proceeding at the same pace as before. China’s comparative advantage in labor-intensive manufacturing has also weakened rapidly, and the feature of its international trade where it mainly targeted developed countries is also becoming weaker."
The Household Registration System Is a Major Challenge in Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Aisixiang , Cai Fang","Jun 19, 2020","These changes are also reflected in the field of social development, where not only has the rate of improvement in income distribution slowed, but social mobility is decreasing. We can observe social mobility and its changing trends from both horizontal and vertical perspectives. Social mobility is a complex issue concerning changes in the social identities of various groups and involving the social class structure, residents’ well-being and recognition of social justice, and whether society is cohesive. Usually, through the choice of migration space by workers in the labor market, i.e., horizontal mobility, individuals, and families realize vertical mobility in themselves, between population cohorts, and through intergenerational occupational changes."
The Household Registration System Is a Major Challenge in Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Aisixiang , Cai Fang","Jun 19, 2020","Since reform and opening up, China has experienced a Lewis-style dual-sector economic development process, mainly manifested in large-scale population flows centered on the transfer of agricultural surplus labor. This resulted in great changes to industrial structures and regional patterns. From 1978 to 2018, the proportion of the agricultural labor force fell from 70.5 percent to 26.1 percent, and the urbanization rate increased from 17.9 percent to 59.6 percent. However, as a result of large-scale labor transfers and demographic changes, the rate of this labor transfer has already entered a period of significant slowdown in recent years. The deceleration of the horizontal mobility of labor across urban and rural areas, regions, and sectors will inevitably have an adverse impact on vertical social mobility as manifested in terms of occupation, income status, and social identity."
The Household Registration System Is a Major Challenge in Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Aisixiang , Cai Fang","Jun 19, 2020","Generally speaking, in a development stage of high-speed economic growth, rapid changes in the industrial structure, substantial improvement in education level, and large-scale and wide-range horizontal flow of labor, the occupational structure tends to improve to a higher level of human capital content and social status. The corresponding changes are also relatively rapid, so the mobility of the whole society is relatively strong. At the same time, while society creates more opportunities for upward mobility, there is not the same probability that another part of the population will be pulled downward (that is, there is more upward mobility than downward mobility). This means that economic development is shared, while social mobility is of a Pareto-improving nature."
The Household Registration System Is a Major Challenge in Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Aisixiang , Cai Fang","Jun 19, 2020","We can grasp two important factors that affect the change in occupational structure and use them to observe the trend of social mobility: The first is the upgrade and optimization of the industrial structure, which is a demand-side factor in the change in occupational structure. The second is the increase in the educational level of the working-age population, which is a supply-side factor in the change in the occupational structure. The rapid improvement of these two factors promoted the transition of the occupational structure to a higher level and, accordingly, led to the enhancement of vertical mobility in society."
The Household Registration System Is a Major Challenge in Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Aisixiang , Cai Fang","Jun 19, 2020","Generally, based on the stage of development or environment a society is in, social mobility can be divided into two types by its nature. First, in the process of rapid growth and structural change, social mobility occurs as a positive-sum game (so it is Pareto-improving). During the period of reform and opening up, Chinese urban and rural residents shared the fruits of development. To date, this has been the main method of social mobility. Second, under the condition of a relatively static total economic size and industrial structure, higher-level occupational positions become increasingly limited. The upward mobility of some groups along the social ladder can lead to a decline in the social position of others. Upward and downward movement are the two sides of the coin of social mobility and occur with equal probability."
The Household Registration System Is a Major Challenge in Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Aisixiang , Cai Fang","Jun 19, 2020","Social mobility is close to a zero-sum game, and in response, a “synthesis paradox” (合成悖论) of social mobility arises. That is to say, when every person and family is striving to come out on top, we see the following situation: The efforts of the groups at the lower end of the social mobility ladder to break the existing pattern and the efforts of the groups at the upper end of the social mobility ladder to maintain their vested interests act in opposite directions, creating conflicts and reducing social cohesion and harmony. In turn, this synthesis paradox strengthens the zero-sum nature of social mobility, resulting in the deterioration of the income distribution situation and the solidification of the current pattern and leading to a lack of a sense of gain or security among all social classes."
The Household Registration System Is a Major Challenge in Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Aisixiang , Cai Fang","Jun 19, 2020","Rapid population expansion, economic growth, and changes in the industrial structure are phenomena that are only observed at a specific stage of development, but social mobility must be maintained in all eras. Therefore, the method to maintain and improve social mobility should not remain unchanged but needs to evolve with the times. While it is true that development is the fundamental way to solve problems in development and it is undoubtedly correct to try to maintain the continued growth of the pie in response to the problem of economic slowdown, at the same time, as we will see later, the removal of various existing institutional obstacles in China through reforms can significantly improve social mobility and distribute the pie more rationally."
The Household Registration System Is a Major Challenge in Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Aisixiang , Cai Fang","Jun 19, 2020","A lack of social mobility is not only the fundamental reason for the continued widening of income gaps but also allows this gap to be passed on from generation to generation. This results in the solidification of social stratification, which in turn leads to a decline in social cohesion. Therefore, government policy efforts aimed at reducing income disparities should include both implementing redistribution systems such as progressive taxation and transfers, as well as broader social policies that facilitate the promotion of social mobility. In China at present, the biggest institutional obstacle to social mobility is the difference in the enjoyment of basic public services between urban and rural areas, between regions, and between groups. The root cause of this systematic difference remains the current household registration system."
The Household Registration System Is a Major Challenge in Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Aisixiang , Cai Fang","Jun 19, 2020","China established the household registration system in the early days of the planned economic system. It was originally intended to prevent rural-to-urban and cross-regional population flows through the strict registration of population residence locations and the provision of segmented and exclusive basic public services. After the official introduction of the household registration system in 1958, apart from limited opportunities such as attending university, joining the army, and planned worker recruitment, there were very few other channels that allowed residents to migrate across regions, and the restrictions on migration between urban and rural areas were particularly strict. The blockage of career change channels and the urban-rural income gap formed by the system made China have extremely low social mobility in the planned economy period."
The Household Registration System Is a Major Challenge in Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Aisixiang , Cai Fang","Jun 19, 2020","Since the mid-1980s, with the advancement of reforms and the acceleration of economic growth, controls on the flow of labor across urban and rural areas and different regions have been gradually relaxed, and these flows have continued to expand in degree and scope. However, although the original intention of the household registration system to restrict population migration and labor mobility has broken down, no fundamental breakthroughs have been made in the system that originally served this purpose and divided the supply of basic public services. This continues to retain the dual social structure formed over a long period, which not only hinders the thoroughness of horizontal population flows but also creates a special population group, solidifies the structure of interests, and has the effect of inhibiting social mobility. This special group is the migrant workers who live and work in cities but have not obtained urban residence permits (户口, hukous). In 2018, a total of 173 million migrant workers left the towns and villages where they had residence permits, and the vast majority when to work and live in cities. However, this group still fails to enjoy equal treatment in the labor market and equal access to basic public services."
The Household Registration System Is a Major Challenge in Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Aisixiang , Cai Fang","Jun 19, 2020","Just as we can still achieve a relatively slow but still reasonable rate of sustainable growth through a shift in the growth model despite the deceleration at higher stages of development by reasonably regulating the initial distribution process and following the principle of “do your best with what you have” in the same way, starting from the equalization of access to basic public services to implement a redistributive policy with Chinese characteristics, we can also maintain social mobility and expand the sharing of economic development in order to continuously improve the well-being of residents. The special challenge facing China is that the more ample mobility and integration of labor are hampered by the delay in the reform of the household registration system."
The Household Registration System Is a Major Challenge in Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Aisixiang , Cai Fang","Jun 19, 2020","First, we must enhance the inclusiveness of the supply of basic public services, gradually stripping and then completely cutting off the connection between the household registration system and the supply of public services. Changing the method where the supply of public goods treated people differently based on household registration status will help break down the systemic barriers that hinder social mobility."
The Household Registration System Is a Major Challenge in Crossing Over the Middle-income Trap,"Aisixiang , Cai Fang","Jun 19, 2020","Second, we must strengthen the central government’s responsibility for expenditures related to the reform of the household registration system and improve the compatibility of incentives between the central and local governments in promoting reform. In view of the huge positive externalities that the reform of the household registration system would bring to China’s economic development, the central government’s payment of the bill is the key to breaking the deadlock. This is also in line with the internal logic of policy formulation and institutional arrangements."

The international security situation was stable overall, but there was a continuous increase in internal tensions. Moreover, the coronavirus pandemic continued to spread. The international security order was tested and subjected to shocks. Unstable factors in international security increased, and there was a rise in uncertain risks. The United States strengthened its maintenance and defense of its hegemony. While striving to uphold its original alliance system, it began to build a new security architecture, thus causing a further intensification of great power competition and a further tightening of the space available for international security cooperation. Geopolitical games triggered tension and conflict in some regions, with the potential for more serious runaway crises, while incubating possible new divisions and combinations. International security governance suffers from many defects. The original order is showing signs of loosening and dysfunction, but it is difficult to establish new norms. Overall, there has been no change in the continually evolving trend of international relations. Globally, the need to advance cooperation and strengthen coordination has correspondingly increased."

"The International Security Situation in 2021: Unstable Factors Increase, Uncertain Risks Rise","Contemporary World , Tang Yongsheng","Jan 15, 2022","Military force is no longer the sole guarantee of security, and total war is no longer the basic form of war. A militarily powerful country, like the United States, may find it easy to achieve victory on the battlefield. Even so, it will find gaining political and economic benefits from such a victory extremely difficult. In July 2021, the United States announced that U.S. military forces would not perform important missions in Iraq and planned to pull out of Iraq by the end of the year. However, so far, it has merely completed a “role conversion” of so-called combat personnel to instructors and advisers. In August 2021, U.S forces hastily withdrew from Afghanistan, and the Taliban quickly took power. The development of the situation in the Middle East and Afghanistan demonstrates the limits to the use of military force in global politics. Even if a country has absolutely superiority in technology and equipment and is capable of annihilating the opponent’s personnel on the battlefield and occupying their territory, it will fail to win a substantive victory on account of having confused war aims."
"The International Security Situation in 2021: Unstable Factors Increase, Uncertain Risks Rise","Contemporary World , Tang Yongsheng","Jan 15, 2022","Given the current international configuration, the absolute laws of war do not completely apply to global political development. Neither a politician nor a military strategist can afford to make strategic decisions that focus only on battlefield outcomes. The more critical issue is the use of military force to achieve political objectives. Particularly in local hybrid wars, one cannot be sure of achieving one’s objectives by annihilating the enemy. The realization of major strategic goals needs to be based on military outcomes, but also should transcend military outcomes. Only then can one integrate military means with other means, namely the political, the diplomatic, and the economic, and thereby seize the strategic initiative."
"The International Security Situation in 2021: Unstable Factors Increase, Uncertain Risks Rise","Contemporary World , Tang Yongsheng","Jan 15, 2022","Even if one is facing a relatively weak opponent armed with inferior weapons, one cannot solve all problems just by relying on a very well-equipped and well-trained army. A final victory is very hard to achieve in the absence of an accurate understanding of the historical evolution of a country or region’s politics and culture. Failure to understand the impact and constraints on the use of military force brought about by developments in the global political landscape may result in ultimately fruitless ventures, no matter how powerful one’s own country is. In 2001, the United States launched a war with the nominal justification of opposing terrorism. However, it takes more than military strength to strike a blow against terrorism. Dedication to extirpating the root causes of terrorism is even more important. The soil which nourishes terrorism and extremism is, more often than not, failures of state and social governance or defects in global governance. There can be no question that the fundamental eradication of terrorism requires long-term, comprehensive policy implementation and broader international cooperation. When we also consider the geopolitical strategic ambitions that lay behind the U.S. anti-terrorism war and the wastage of national power that it entailed, we find “strategic failure” and “political failure” behind the success of the military operations."

"The International Security Situation in 2021: Unstable Factors Increase, Uncertain Risks Rise","Contemporary World , Tang Yongsheng","Jan 15, 2022","The United States gave prominence to great power strategic competition during the Trump administration. There has been no reversal of this trend since Biden assumed office. Rather, it has expanded in scope and encompassed a wider range of sectors, with impacts that are even more profound and far-reaching. In the military sphere, the United States has further reinforced its frontline presence in the Indo-Pacific and Eastern European regions so as to ensure that it has sufficient deterrents to meet any challenge. It has strengthened its military relationship with allies and partners and has built a more powerful defensive network. For a while now, the United States has greatly increased the frequency of activities such as military exercises, espionage and reconnaissance, and bomber flights along Russia’s borders and in China’s periphery. The U.S. nuclear submarine collision that occurred in the South China Sea suggests that the frequency of such operations by U.S. military forces has already exceeded what is normal for geo-military activities. U.S. strategic planning and military deployments bring with them signs of increasing danger. They exacerbate tense situations in the relevant regions."
"The International Security Situation in 2021: Unstable Factors Increase, Uncertain Risks Rise","Contemporary World , Tang Yongsheng","Jan 15, 2022","In reality, the United States is the only country in the world that lacks a credible, comprehensive security threat. All those that it has deemed to be opponents are surrounded by its military bases and within range of its nuclear missiles. The United States has numerous military bases worldwide, and they constitute direct pressures and threats on some countries, including Russia and China. The intensification of such pressures and threats necessarily escalates great power competition. For example, the United States has increased the frequency of its military exercises in the Baltic and Black Seas and has been conducting exercises with aircraft armed with strategic weapons. The United States held “Global Thunder” strategic nuclear force exercises, in which its strategic bombers were, at their closest, only 20 kilometers from the Russian border. The U.S. Pentagon published an assessment report in November 2021 that revealed that the United States would strengthen its force deployments against China and Russia and improve infrastructure and that it planned to upgrade military bases in Guam and Australia."
"The International Security Situation in 2021: Unstable Factors Increase, Uncertain Risks Rise","Contemporary World , Tang Yongsheng","Jan 15, 2022","In July 2021, U.S. Secretary of Defense Austin gave a rather complete explanation of the U.S. “integrated deterrence strategy.” He emphasized the combining of U.S. strengths with those of its allies and appropriately intertwining technology, combat concepts, and various capabilities into a network so as to form a reliable, flexible, and powerful deterrence capability. The “integrated deterrence strategy” will have an important pull effect on the future U.S. military defense posture. Austin also emphasized that it is no longer possible to rely solely on military force to defend against an opponent’s attack, but rather one should force the opponent to retreat in the face of the difficulties presented by “integrated deterrence.” The United States will likely make some major adjustments in accordance with this strategic design to its alliance system and even to its overall security architecture and thus intensify efforts to strategically squeeze and divide its opponents. Since 2021, the United States has been accelerating the implementation of its “Indo-Pacific strategy,” upgrading the “Quad mechanism” that includes the United States, Japan, India, and Australia, and trying to construct a “tripartite alliance” of the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. All of these moves reflect the importance that the Biden administration attaches to coordination with its allies and partners. It is actively reshaping the United States-led alliance system."
"The International Security Situation in 2021: Unstable Factors Increase, Uncertain Risks Rise","Contemporary World , Tang Yongsheng","Jan 15, 2022","At the same time, NATO is adjusting its deployments against Russia and is further emphasizing non-conventional war content. It is carrying out strategic adjustments that include nuclear strikes, cyberwarfare, and space war. These moves are highly likely to set off a new arms race. In the event of such a situation, the already tense state of affairs between NATO and Russia may gradually escalate. Russia’s Southern Military District has already announced that it is re-equipping units under its command and that over 70% of the weapons systems and specialized equipment have been improved. Russia strengthened its southwestern air defense capabilities in order to counterbalance pressure from NATO. In recent years, the main European nations have been updating or developing new national security strategies, which will give rise to a new round of strategic interactions. Russia is now beefing up deployment of long-range anti-ship missiles. The first batch of extended-range missiles will be delivered to the coastal defense brigades of the Northern Fleet and the Black Sea Fleet. In 2021, Russia brought out a new “national security strategy,” which contained all of the relevant factors and clearly defined strategic priorities. It especially emphasized that “the goal of information security is to strengthen the Russian Federation’s sovereignty in information space.” In planning for “strategic stability and mutually beneficial international cooperation,” Russia will lay even greater stress on the “multi-dimensional, multi-layered, multi-objective” line so as to uphold a beneficial equilibrium in foreign relations."

The old logic of hegemonism, power politics, and capital expansion will not automatically exit the stage of history. At the same time, the relevant standpoints and efforts for building a new order have yet to be fully presented and affirmed. In the transition from old to new orders, the co-existence of multiple rules has highlighted the complexity of international relations as never before, and uncertainties in international security have become even more prominent. Thus, the strategic concerns of some countries not only have not decreased, but have in fact increased. An obvious sense of insecurity has arisen in the changing world. Against the background of a world economy that is universally depressed owing to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, some countries and regions are still increasing their investments in armaments. The total amount of global military expenditures in 2020 was 1.981 trillion U.S. dollars, the highest level since the end of the Cold War. While global economic growth declined more than 4%, global military spending grew 2.6% in the same period. According to incomplete statistics, global military spending in 2021 is expected to exceed 1.94 trillion U.S. dollars. Although this represents a slight decline relative to 2020, the level of spending remains high. In response to this, over 50 Nobel Laureates issued a public letter in which they stated that “some governments increase military spending under competitive pressure, leading to an intensification of the global arms race and constituting a colossal waste.”"

At present, the important new fields that are closely tied to national security include: space, deep sea, cyber, biology, and AI. Human “feelers” have gradually extended to virtual frontiers, deep frontiers, remote frontiers, and micro-frontiers and thus have brought about changes in national security structures and in the development and innovation of national security thinking. In international competition, new fields may often transcend traditional fields and have unique advantages. Pioneers can gain a leg up and seize the strategic initiative.

Important progress was made in the AI, space, and near space fields in particular. There was an acceleration in the application of relevant technologies to specific military equipment, with critical technologies developing at an unimaginably fast rate. Russia and the United States have been developing these fields at impressive rates. In July 2021, Russia conducted its first large-scale military exercise for the purpose of defending against and intercepting hypersonic missiles. It did so in order to test and evaluate the state of guided dispatching and equipment training in the Russian military forces. As for equipment development, the Russian hypersonic missile, called Kinzhal, already possesses preliminary combat capability. After it is launched, it travels at high speeds and, swooping down from the sky at 10 times the speed of sound, precisely strikes its target. The Zircon anti-ship missile is also undergoing further testing and, according to plans, should be deployable to combat units in 2022. In a space test conducted in November 2021, Russia elicited the concern of many countries when it hit and destroyed one of its own decommissioned orbiting satellites. As soon as he assumed office, U.S. President Biden announced the institution of an aggressive space program, demanding that the U.S. Space Force simultaneously possess combat and combat support capabilities to implement rapid, sustained attack and defense space operations and thus maintain the U.S. lead in space. To enable its own hypersonic weapons and hypersonic missiles to become mission-capable sooner, the U.S. military performed multiple targeted tests in 2021."

Space supremacy, deep sea supremacy, biosupremacy, and dominance of the AI field will become the new critical factors in winning great power competitions and wars, and the development of new forces will spur revolutionary changes in military force systems. The new fields are spaces in which new combat capabilities can grow. They are also the main vehicles whereby traditional military forces can be brought into play. They will play a critical role in high-end wars. For example, cyber warfare capabilities have become fundamental factors in military systems; unmanned combat systems will significantly raise the intelligentization level of combat operations; and hypersonic weapons will become the trump card of strategic strikes. This is a development trend in which new branches of the armed services will continue to appear and become incorporated into the original military force system—the space force, the cyber force, and even service branches that may become more important than the traditional armed services as they grow from strategic support forces into important combat forces.

In Southeast Asia, some external factors have become the main causes of volatility, while, in South Asia, the situation in Afghanistan is again changing rapidly because the United States and some European countries are actively strengthening relations with India.

The Palestinian armed forces, mainly composed of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), fired rockets at Israeli targets. Both sides suffered major casualties and property losses. However, following the conflict, Israel and Palestine had more contacts and negotiations, which bore some fruit. Turning now to Eastern Europe and the South Caucasus, we find that the aftershocks of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict have yet to subside completely; friction remains between the two countries of Azerbaijan and Armenia. Internal disputes persist in some countries. Political disputes in Georgia and Ukraine have intensified. The geopolitical games of foreign great powers have cast a huge shadow on these regions. In Africa, terrorist activities have intensified and spread. Terrorist attacks are becoming severe, particularly in the Sahei region of Northern Africa.

There is no returning to the past, even for transatlantic U.S.-EU relations. With the help of the Strategic Compass program, the EU wants to push forward with military fusion and thus, by 2025, will establish a 5,000-man joint force for autonomous response to crises. In the midst of a changing world, U.S. and European interests no longer overlap as they once did. They cannot remain as tightly joined as they were during the Cold War in opposition to the Soviet Union. General U.S. dominance over Europe will persist, yet it will, without a doubt, gradually weaken. Conflicts of interest are increasing between them, and their goals are inevitably diverging. The U.S. Biden administration has made many efforts to repair the transatlantic partnership, but a thorough turnaround is difficult to bring about given the influence of domestic politics. Independent defense has become an objective requirement for Europe in light of the evolving situation. It is also a necessary response to the United States tangible and intangible suppression of France and Germany and its method of roping in Central and Eastern Europe. If even European countries cannot solve problems for Europe, then no one can. The G7 Summit held in June 2021 produced minimal results.

As for Sino-U.S., relations, Europe might benefit from a moderate degree of decoupling.

The changing world demands that all countries jointly work actively towards using more effective international coordination and cooperation to deal with transnational and global security risks and challenges and to placate and hedge against the enormous conflicts which might result from uncertainties.

The ever-increasing demand for security cooperation and security governance will spur continuous change in international relations."

Repeated crises and conflicts warn us again and again that the international community should not only strengthen multilateral cooperation and strive to avoid war, but, even more importantly, it should actively build and maintain peace. Therefore, we must effectively advance the global governance process, gradually find channels and measures for resolving disputes and ending conflicts, and achieve a beneficial balance between institutional supply and practical demand, thereby promoting the realization of sustainable development and sustainable security."
The Pendulum of History——International Politics 30 Years After the Collapse of the Soviet Union,"Russian, East European & Central Asian Studies , Zhao Huasheng","Nov 13, 2021","Abstract: This year marks the 30th anniversary of the collapse of the Soviet Union. The collapse of the Soviet Union 30 years ago changed history, brought about subversive changes in international politics, and set the world in a new direction. Some people asserted that history had come to an end, and it seemed that a period had been placed to mark the close of historic changes. But today, 30 years later, the picture is completely different. The development of history is unexpected, and a series of major international political changes stemming from the breakup of the Soviet Union has changed direction or even reversed. This paper highlights five areas, namely the resurgence of the Cold War, the reappearance of the bipolar structure, the restructuring of the new East-West system, the decline of liberalism, and the collapse of the ideal of Greater Europe, and discusses and analyzes these five changes."

The Soviet Union was not just a country, it was an “empire,” representing a bloc of states covering Eurasia, a global military and economic union, and a worldwide ideology and social system. Therefore, the disintegration of the Soviet Union refers not only to the landmark day of December 25, 1991, but also to the disintegration of the Soviet “imperial” system. This is the disintegration of the global political system, economic system, military alliance, and ideological system centered on the Soviet Union."

At the time, all of this led everyone to dream beautiful dreams about the future of the world, and it was believed that the world would embark on a bright road from then on."

Instead, like a pendulum, it swung back after a high peak to one side. Many major changes in international politics that occurred due to the collapse of the Soviet Union did not continue. On the contrary, they all reversed to varying degrees, or even returned to the starting point. Among these, changes in five areas are particularly prominent."

Some believe it was marked by the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989, and others use the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact on July 1, 1991 as its symbol, but its root cause was the collapse of the Soviet Empire.

That is to say, in the 30 years after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the relationship between great powers has gone from ending one Cold War to starting a new Cold War."

There are different views on whether a new Cold War will take place. Some people think that there will be no new Cold War. The main reason is that it is a completely different era.
The international environment is no longer the same as it was during the Cold War. There is no confrontation between two global alliances of nations, there is no confrontation between two evenly matched military blocs, there are no two isolated economic markets, and no competition between the two ideologies of communism and capitalism. Humanity is now facing more and more serious common threats. Major powers not only have competitive interests, but also common interests.

Without a doubt, time does not run backward, and a Cold War with the same spatial and temporal characteristics and the same form as the original Cold War will never reappear. However, great power relations still exist, and they still have their traditional content. From this perspective, the nature of great power relations can recur. In this sense, the emergence of a new Cold War is possible. Also, some scholars have discussed the nature of the Cold War, and they have different understandings. One view holds that the Cold War was a special form of international political conflict that can be repeated. Another view was that the Cold War was a unique phenomenon in international politics, one-of-a-kind and unrepeatable. Here, the author adopts the former explanation. The new Cold War is a description of the nature of today’s great power relations. This description is based on the actual situation of great power relations today and does not consider whether the situation is completely consistent with the form of the original Cold War. The new Cold War is not a simple reproduction of the form of the Cold War. It differs from the Cold War in terms of characteristics and manifestations. However, in essence, it is as cold as the US-Soviet Cold War, and in some ways even colder."

The United States implements a policy of strategic containment against China and Russia, which is also open, determined, comprehensive, and systematic. Although both China and Russia hope to establish cooperative relations with the United States and there will be one side of cooperation between them, this does not change the basic positioning and policy of the United States towards China and Russia.

That is, without exception, when each successive US president left the White House, Russian-US relations were worse than when he entered the White House.

In this process, the contradictions, differences, conflicts, doubts, distrust, and hostility between Russia and the United States have been constantly accumulating and expanding. It can be said that, except for a short period of time at the beginning of Russian independence, the relationship between Russia and the United States has been confrontational at all other times.

The turning point that marked the general deterioration and antagonism in the relationship between the two countries came during the Trump era. During this period, the original basis of Sino-US relations was completely deconstructed, and the relationship between the two countries was placed in a completely different environment and atmosphere. The close economic ties and huge trade volume that was previously the driving force and stabilizer of Sino-US relations have now become a source of contradiction and an irritating factor. The United States wants to “decouple” from China economically and technologically. China’s political system has become the target of U.S. attacks, and the United States has manufactured so-called human rights issues in Hong Kong and Xinjiang. They have also launched provocative military activities against China in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait, blamed China for the COVID-19 pandemic, used the COVID-19 pandemic to launch attacks on China, and is forming regional and international alliances against China. To put it simply, the United States has implemented a comprehensive and public siege of China. Chinese officials also often describe it as a diplomatic war, trade war, technological war, or public opinion war between the United States and China. Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to call it a new Cold War."

Therefore, the new Cold War has a tendency to develop on a wider scale, that is, to form a new Cold War with the United States on one side and China and Russia on the other. Of course, this is different from the original Cold War period. China and Russia do not have a military alliance, there is not a confrontation between two military groups, and military confrontation is not its main content. The significance of this new Cold War manifests more in international politics. However, the political divide between the United States and China and Russia is an objective reality. The United States is implementing a dual containment policy against China and Russia, while China and Russia support each other and jointly resist the strategic pressure of the United States. Therefore, looking at the macro level, to a certain extent, this inevitably brings to mind the Cold War between the East and the West."

The United States and the Soviet Union were the two superpowers during the Cold War, and the demise of the Soviet Union left the United States the sole superpower. The national power of the United States was beyond the reach of other countries, the bipolar structure changed to a unipolar structure, and the era of unipolar hegemony of the United States arrived. In the post-Cold War period, this state of things seemed like it would persist unchanged for a long period. Now, however, we can see that the development of history has turned another corner. Thirty years later, although the United States is still the country with the greatest overall national strength, the unipolar world has become increasingly difficult to maintain, and a new bipolar structure is emerging."

The status of the United States has not changed, but China has replaced the Soviet Union, forming a new Sino-US bipolar structure. Compared with US-Soviet bipolarity, the new bipolar structure is significantly different. Its scale in international politics is smaller, its main entities are two countries, not two political and military blocs, and this structure does not divide the world in two. Its influence is also small, and it does not determine overall global politics."

The author’s view is: International politics are now in a transitional period, and the international structure presents great contradictions. Multipolar elements, bipolar elements, and unipolar elements all coexist. In this general pattern, multipolarization is the basic framework, bipolarization is rising rapidly, and unipolarization is trending downward. There is a complex relationship between the new bipolarity and multipolarization, but it is not antagonistic and mutually exclusive. The new bipolarity does not go beyond the multipolar structure, but still exists under the multipolar framework. The author would express this by saying the bipolar structure that stands out against the multipolar framework."

During the subsequent 30 years, China made the leap from a poor and backward country to become the second most powerful country in the world. Although it still lags behind the United States in overall national strength, it has already very close behind the United States. Even if China does not have the goal of surpassing the United States, the United States can already feel China breathing down its neck."

According to one set of data, in 1992, at the beginning of the collapse of the Soviet Union, the GDP of the United States was US$6.52 trillion, accounting for 25.6% of the world’s total economic output. China, on the other hand, had a GDP of only US$426.9 billion, accounting for 1.67% of the world’s total economic output. China’s total economic output was less than 1/15 of that of the United States, ranking tenth in the world. By 2020, the U.S. GDP more than tripled to US$20.94 trillion, but its share of the world’s total economic output declined to 24.7%. During the same period, China’s total economic output grew more than 34 times over, reaching US$14.72 trillion, close to 70% of that of the United States and accounting for about 17% of the world’s total economic output. Since 2005, with the expansion of the aggregate base of the Chinese economy, China’s economic growth has also greatly increased in absolute terms. China’s share of the world’s total economic output has increased by about 1 percentage point almost every year, from 4.8% in 2005 to about 17% today. According to various forecasts, based on the current trend, China will surpass the United States in terms of total economic output and become the world’s largest economy in the near future."

Economic development provides the material conditions for the development of other fields, China can make large-scale investments in various fields, including technology, manufacturing, infrastructure construction, foreign investment, overseas development, international aid, military, education, culture, medical care, environmental protection, and social welfare. This has produced very obvious results, rapidly increasing China’s overall national strength and capabilities. China’s rise has been able to produce such a massive effect not only because of its rapid development speed, but also because of the huge scale of China’s economy and the scale of its acceleration. Neither speed nor scale alone is enough to achieve world power status, but China has both. Now, China is at the forefront of the world in the fourth industrial revolution represented by the information revolution and ranks first in world trade. China invests in and undertakes projects overseas on a large scale. China’s design, manufacturing, and construction capabilities are astounding, the status of the RMB as an international reserve currency and settlement currency is on the rise, and China’s military power is developing rapidly. All of these factors have strengthened China’s overall national strength and made the United States feel that China is “the only competitor with the potential to combine its economic, diplomatic, military, and technological strength” to mount a continuous challenge to the United States."

It does not have special political attributes in itself. The existence of two counties more powerful than all others does not mean that bipolarization is inevitable. In physics, the so-called two poles must be mutually exclusive, which is also true in international politics. If two great powers are in a state of mutual non-interference, or in a state of friendly coexistence, there will be no bipolarization. A bipolar relationship can exist between two powers only when they are in a relationship of rivalry. The United States regards China as a strategic opponent and implements a policy of containment, adding a competitive and antagonistic nature to the relationship between the two countries. This is another key factor in turning Sino-US relations into a new bipolarity."

The superpower status of China and the United States on the world stage will be maintained long-term. China still maintains the momentum of faster development compared to other major powers and will move closer to the United States in terms of total national strength, while other countries will fall farther behind China. America’s dominance on the world stage is declining, but this decline is only relative and primarily relative to China. The U.S. economy is not in absolute recession and is developing at a normal rate. For the foreseeable future, the U.S. will remain the country with the greatest total strength. The combined GDP of China and the United States will remain above 40% of the world’s total economic output and shows a continuing upward trend. The economic gap between other countries and China and the United States will continue to widen. The material basis of Sino-US polarization is continuing to grow."

Regardless of whether the Republican Party or the Democratic Party is in power, this policy will not be changed. China no longer entertains any illusions about positive changes in U.S. policy towards China and will resolutely fight back on issues concerning China’s fundamental interests. This means that Sino-US relations will be in contradiction, conflict, and struggle. Although there will also be relaxations and cooperation and, after a period of adaptation and smoothing out, the bilateral relationship may also enter a relatively stable and orderly state in the future, strategic competition will be the basic feature of the long-term relationship between the two countries.

To be precise, the Eastern system disappeared, while the Western system not only remained, but also developed and expanded with the attitude of a victor. Many countries from the former Eastern system have turned to the West, accepting Western values, adopting Western political systems, and entering into Western-led international institutions and organizations. In other words, the Western system annexed the Eastern system, and the Western system became, in a sense, the world system. Since the East-West system no longer exists, the East-West confrontation of the Cold War-era also no longer exists."

As a result, there will naturally be considerable controversy concerning this view. Like the new Cold War and the new bipolarity, the new East-West is not a simple repetition of the East-West system during the Cold War. In nature and form, its differences from the Cold War-era East-West system are more obvious. The author once called it a “soft system,” which means that it has the characteristics of a system, but is not yet complete and mature. It can also be called a “quasi-system.” At this stage, the new East-West system has already begun to exist in people’s political consciousness in international politics. It is mainly a division formed by political identity. Its state and structure are still partially obscured and hard to pin down. There is no clear line between the new East and the West. They are not found in a confrontation between two political and military blocs, nor are they absolute and complete oppositions. They may be partners and collaborators in some aspects and in some areas. Nonetheless, based on a series of visible and objective facts, it is clear that the world is being re-divided and the contours of two political hemispheres of global significance are becoming more and more apparent, although they are not yet fully formed and finalized."
The Pendulum of History——International Politics 30 Years After the Collapse of the Soviet Union,"Russian, East European & Central Asian Studies , Zhao Huasheng","Nov 13, 2021","The primary reason for the emergence of the New East system is its conscious fabrication by the United States and the West. It can be observed that, after the end of the Cold War, the strategic goal of the United States and the West was to dissolve the East into the Western system. It implemented a policy of “pulling” China and Russia, that is, trying to pull China and Russia into the Western system. Of course, this would require China and Russia to accept Western values and dominance. Therefore, in the early and middle stages of the post-Cold War period, the U.S. policy towards China and Russia was centered on “engagement.” However, the reality indicated that China and Russia would not be remade based on the Western model, would not give up their independent status, and would not accept the unipolar hegemony of the United States. After that, the strategic thinking of the United States changed. It positioned China and Russia as confrontational strategic competitors, and the United States turned to the policy of strategic containment against China and Russia. However, the United States does not regard China and Russia as two isolated objects, but regards China and Russia as a unit. At the same time, the United States does not deal with China and Russia alone, but wants to partner with Europe and some other countries to rebuild a Western alliance against the East, similar to the alliance of the Cold War-era. In this way, a camp was formed by the United States and Europe to oppose China and Russia, and a new East-West system was recreated."

In this sense, the New East-West system can be said to be a Western vs. non-Western system. The foundation of the New West is the countries belonging to the Western political and cultural sphere, which almost coincide with the members of the old Western system, while the composition of the New East system has changed significantly from the Cold War period.
This is a new series of countries, and their respective domestic political systems and religious cultures may be very different, but they have one feature in common, which is that they are all non-Western countries."

In degree, it is no less than that of the East-West system during the Cold War, but the ideological content is different. It is no longer the opposition between communism and capitalism. Rather, in the definition of the West, it is the opposition between liberal democratic values and authoritarian and authoritarian institutions. The New West represents liberal democratic values and institutions, while the New East embodies totalitarianism and authoritarian institutions. Therefore, liberal democracy has become the banner of the United States against China and Russia, and it promotes the construction of an alliance against China and Russia called the “Democratic Alliance.” The summit of heads of non-Western countries promoted by the United States is called the “Summit for Democracy,” and the international order it advocates is called the liberal international order.

When Trump was in power, he proposed to “decouple” from China economically and technologically, block Chinese technology from entering the world market, boycott China’s “One Belt, One Road” initiative, impose economic sanctions on China and Russia, and promote an exclusive regional economic integration mechanism. to a certain extent, this is the splitting of the world economy into two systems aligned with the new East and West, although this split is not yet very deep."
The Pendulum of History——International Politics 30 Years After the Collapse of the Soviet Union,"Russian, East European & Central Asian Studies , Zhao Huasheng","Nov 13, 2021","This trend of separation is more pronounced in the security realm. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is developing in the direction of “North Atlantic—Indian Ocean—Pacific Ocean.” Major NATO countries such as the UK, Germany, and France as well as Japan have begun to send warships, including aircraft carriers, to the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, and a networked and coordinated military cooperation relationship is being formed among them. At the same time, the military cooperation of the quadrilateral US-Japan-India-Australia mechanism is deepening, and a “line of defense” is emerging from the Arctic Ocean, the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the South China Sea and the East China Sea. This is not only a challenge to China’s strategic security, but also a threat to Russia’s strategic security. On the other hand, under external strategic pressure, Sino-Russian military and security cooperation has become increasingly close, strengthened in its strategic nature, expanded in its fields of cooperation, and widened in its scope of cooperation. The two countries have formed a stable mutual support structure in the area of strategic security. Whether it is subjective or not, the trend in the field of international security is moving towards a new confrontation between the two fronts."
The Pendulum of History——International Politics 30 Years After the Collapse of the Soviet Union,"Russian, East European & Central Asian Studies , Zhao Huasheng","Nov 13, 2021","The latest international political and security developments are also reinforcing this trend. In September 2021, the United States, the UK, and Australia announced the establishment of a new military alliance. The new military alliance targets the Indo-Pacific region. In fact, it is aimed at China and Russia and may form the basis of an Asian version of NATO. At the same time, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) initiated the process of accepting Iran as a full member. After the United States withdrew from Afghanistan, the Afghan government supported by the United States quickly collapsed, and Afghanistan is likely to move closer to China and Russia. Thus, in a geopolitical sense, China, Russia, Central Asia, South Asia, and West Asia have truly become a complete regional combination with the SCO as the tie and framework. It is not an anti-Western combination, but it is unquestionably a “non-Western” one."
The Pendulum of History——International Politics 30 Years After the Collapse of the Soviet Union,"Russian, East European & Central Asian Studies , Zhao Huasheng","Nov 13, 2021","It is necessary to point out the special role of the Indo-Pacific strategy in the new East-West system. It is the most important comprehensive institutional vehicle of the new West system. Although the Indo-Pacific strategy is a strategy named after a region, it is, in a certain sense, the grand strategy of the United States. If we say the United States has a European strategy, an African strategy, and a Latin American strategy, none of them will have the overall strategic significance of the Indo-Pacific strategy. The Indo-Pacific strategy chooses the most politically and economically active regions in the world as its area of activity and targets China and Russia, the main strategic opponents of the United States. It has attracted the adherence of almost all of America’s allies, especially the European Union and NATO. These factors give the Indo-Pacific strategy a global nature."
The Pendulum of History——International Politics 30 Years After the Collapse of the Soviet Union,"Russian, East European & Central Asian Studies , Zhao Huasheng","Nov 13, 2021","In almost every respect, the Indo-Pacific strategy is characteristic of the new West system. Its members, the United States, India, Japan, and Australia, are all Western countries in terms of politics and, in terms of ideology, claim to represent the liberal international order. In terms of regional economic integration, China is excluded. In terms of security, the system is developing in the direction of a security mechanism targeting China and Russia based on the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), and it will naturally echo with the newly established US-UK-Australia military alliance. This shows us that, even in geographical features, the Indo-Pacific strategy coincides with the new East system. Both the new East-West system or Indo-Pacific strategy see the basic geographical dividing line to be between Eurasian countries and maritime countries. China and Russia are the largest Eurasian countries, while the new West system and Indo-Pacific strategy countries are mostly maritime countries. Although this is not a reproduction of the traditional system of competition between land and sea power, the difference in geographical features between the groups is objective. Even more importantly, the significance of this difference is not just geographic, it also has important strategic and security implications."

The Pendulum of History——International Politics 30 Years After the Collapse of the Soviet Union,"Russian, East European & Central Asian Studies , Zhao Huasheng","Nov 13, 2021","After the collapse of the Soviet Union, liberalism entered the most glorious period in its history. In terms of ideas and value systems, liberalism is widely admired and exercises a fascinating attraction. In terms of national development models, the liberal political model has become an object of emulation for many countries. In international relations, the model of exporting liberal democracy proved its own political correctness and broke through the constraints of traditional international rules. Simply put, in the eyes of the West, history ended here. After liberalism, there was no higher human ideal, and no better model of the state than the democratic political system."
The Pendulum of History——International Politics 30 Years After the Collapse of the Soviet Union,"Russian, East European & Central Asian Studies , Zhao Huasheng","Nov 13, 2021","But now, throughout the world, liberalism has suffered major setbacks, both in theory and in practice. Liberalism still exists and will continue to exist for a long time to come, and it will continue to occupy a prominent place on the world stage as an ideology and a political model. but now it is undoubtedly going from ascendancy to retreat. Its ideological appeal is in decline, and its political model has ceased to be an object of universal emulation, and in a philosophical sense. Its absoluteness has been questioned, its unique status has been challenged, and its nature as an end-point has been denied."
The Pendulum of History——International Politics 30 Years After the Collapse of the Soviet Union,"Russian, East European & Central Asian Studies , Zhao Huasheng","Nov 13, 2021","The most fundamental reason for this retreat is found in liberalism itself. It has given rise to great problems in national development and governance, an internal separation between rich and poor, political division, accumulation of social problems, and a lack of ability on the part of institutions to renew themselves, resulting in a predicament where no effective solution can be found. On the other hand, non-Western countries such as China have risen rapidly, displaying higher efficiency in economic development and social governance. This provides a comparison, where the superiority of the liberal model of development is challenged and it can no longer claim to be the best and only correct model. After the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the United States, which has the best medical resources, did not perform well in its response to the epidemic and ranked first in total deaths ranked first among all countries.
This particularly exposed the weaknesses of the Western model of governance, although some Western countries have done better."
The Pendulum of History——International Politics 30 Years After the Collapse of the Soviet Union,"Russian, East European & Central Asian Studies , Zhao Huasheng","Nov 13, 2021","At the same time, the West’s export of liberal values and political institutions outside the Western world has suffered a near-total failure. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States and the West, as the victors of the Cold War, began to forcefully export liberalism to the whole world and carry out the liberal transformation on non-Western countries. The factors driving the United States and the West are not only the messianic ideology that regards liberalism as a gospel to be spread throughout the world, but also the arbitrary willfulness of a U.S. hegemony lacking checks and balances and a selfish pursuit of geopolitical or economic interests."
The Pendulum of History——International Politics 30 Years After the Collapse of the Soviet Union,"Russian, East European & Central Asian Studies , Zhao Huasheng","Nov 13, 2021","The liberal model is mainly exported in two ways, one is through a “color revolution” and the other is the direct use of force and war. However, no matter the method, it has not brought real democracy and freedom to the target countries, nor has it resulted in obvious economic and social development. On the contrary, it caused national turmoil and social chaos. The pursuit of liberal transformation by force of arms has brought disastrous consequences. The military interventions of the United States have plunged Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and Libya into wars. In these countries, the economy has collapsed, years of construction achievements have been destroyed, countless civilians have been killed and injured, and a large number of people have been displaced and become refugees. Refugees have also become a serious problem faced by Western countries."
The Pendulum of History——International Politics 30 Years After the Collapse of the Soviet Union,"Russian, East European & Central Asian Studies , Zhao Huasheng","Nov 13, 2021","The war in Afghanistan is the latest example of the failure of the export of liberalism. In August 2021, the United States hastily withdrew its troops from Afghanistan, the Taliban regained power, and the United States’ 20-year war in Afghanistan ended in complete failure. The failure of the United States was not only a failure to win a war, it was a failure on the part of the United States to export liberalism. It is believed that when the United States launched its war in Afghanistan, they had no plan for a long-term war. Initially, the US-Afghan war was primarily retaliatory and punitive, and because of this, it was widely understood and supported by the international community at that time. However, after destroying al-Qaeda and overthrowing the Taliban regime, U.S. war aims quietly began to change, and the United States began to pursue geopolitical goals. At the same time, the United States has shifted from retaliation against al-Qaeda and the Taliban to implementing a democratic transformation of Afghanistan in an attempt to build and maintain an Afghan state that would conform to liberal values and adopts a Western-style regime. This is the main reason the war in Afghanistan dragged on for 20 years."
The Pendulum of History——International Politics 30 Years After the Collapse of the Soviet Union,"Russian, East European & Central Asian Studies , Zhao Huasheng","Nov 13, 2021","From the perspective of historical progressivism, liberalism has significant value, especially when compared to extremist religious thought and politics. Many non-Western countries, including China and Russia, also favor democracy and freedom, although they interpret these terms somewhat differently. But the problem is that exporting democracy by force of arms itself violates the idea of democracy, so it is no longer democracy. The imposition of one’s own ideas and models on other countries cannot but arouse the resistance of the people of the other countries. Moreover, any institutional model requires corresponding ideological and cultural preparations, and it needs to strike a certain balance with local historical and cultural traditions before it can bear fruit. Sowing seeds on unsuitable soil cannot yield the desired fruit. The relationship between modernity and tradition is often a contradictory one, and maintaining a dynamic balance is the most feasible way to move forward. America’s defeat in Afghanistan was a landmark event for the expansion of liberalism. It marked the historic failure of the idea of saving the world through liberalism and made people, including in the West, realize that liberalism is not a value that is welcomed around the world, nor is it a system that can be transplanted arbitrarily. This is not necessarily a sign of the end of U.S. hegemony, but it leads to a pessimistic conclusion concerning the historical experiment of the promotion of liberalism throughout the world by the United States and the West."
The Pendulum of History——International Politics 30 Years After the Collapse of the Soviet Union,"Russian, East European & Central Asian Studies , Zhao Huasheng","Nov 13, 2021","The hegemonic behavior and performance of the United States have also dealt a heavy blow to liberalism. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States, as the only superpower, no longer had a counterbalance and could act at will without restriction or punishment. However, the United States did not impose rational constraints on itself. Instead, it moved towards unilateralism, ignored the interests of other countries, disregarded the constraints of international law, arbitrarily interfered in the internal affairs of other countries, withdrew from international institutions, implemented sanctions policies, and frequently launched wars and used force against other countries, especially when it launched the war against Iraq based on false evidence. The cameras that presented U.S. lies to the world have not only caused a precipitous drop in U.S. moral credibility, but also put out the enchanting light of liberalism."

The Pendulum of History——International Politics 30 Years After the Collapse of the Soviet Union,"Russian, East European & Central Asian Studies , Zhao Huasheng","Nov 13, 2021","The union of Russia and Europe in a Greater Europe has been a long-standing topic. The idea of a Greater Europe was put forward even during the Soviet era. Charles de Gaulle once proposed the establishment of a Greater Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals and Gorbachev also proposed the idea of a “Common European Home.” However, it was not until the collapse of the Soviet Union, the end of the Cold War, and the cessation of the confrontation between the two major blocs that the blueprint for a Greater Europe became a realistic possibility for the first time."
The Pendulum of History——International Politics 30 Years After the Collapse of the Soviet Union,"Russian, East European & Central Asian Studies , Zhao Huasheng","Nov 13, 2021","In the period following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia and Europe did indeed make mutual approaches to each other and both sides also held great enthusiasm and expectations for the realization of a greater Europe. In terms of political relations, in 1994, Russia and the European Union signed a 10-year Partnership and Cooperation Agreement and established the Russia-EU summit mechanism. Since 1998, the Russian and EU heads of state have met twice a year. In 2003, the Russia-EU summit in St. Petersburg proposed a plan to create four unified spaces from Lisbon to Vladivostok, namely a unified economic space, a unified freedom, security, and judicial space, a unified external security space, and a unified science, education, and cultural space. In 2010, Russia and the European Union launched a modernization partnership. In terms of security relations, Russia and NATO signed the Bilateral Military Cooperation Plan in 1996, and in 1997, Russia and NATO established the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council. In 2002, it was decided to establish a more substantial NATO-Russia Council to replace the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council, which mainly focused on liaison functions."
The Pendulum of History——International Politics 30 Years After the Collapse of the Soviet Union,"Russian, East European & Central Asian Studies , Zhao Huasheng","Nov 13, 2021","However, the current reality is that Russia is still Russia, and Europe is still Europe. Although Russia and Europe are neighbors, it is hard to make them a family. Even more, Russia’s relations with Europe are now at their worst point since the end of the Cold War, and the estrangement between the two sides is even deeper than in the latter period of the Soviet Union. The picture Greater Europe has dimmed and become increasingly blurry. Europe and Russia are not drawing together, but drifting apart. The topic of Greater Europe is no longer on the agenda of Russia-European relations, and the four common spaces are no longer brought up. The theme of these bilateral relations is not cooperation but mutual dissatisfaction. In terms of political relations, Russian-European relations have been buffeted by a continuous series of events and crises. In terms of security relations, the two sides have escalated to military standoffs in Eastern Europe, the Baltic Sea, and the Black Sea. Economic relations between the two sides have also declined. Although the EU is still Russia’s largest trading partner, due to sanctions and the pandemic, the EU’s share of Russia’s foreign trade has dropped from over 50% previously to below 40% currently, reaching 37% in 2020."
The Pendulum of History——International Politics 30 Years After the Collapse of the Soviet Union,"Russian, East European & Central Asian Studies , Zhao Huasheng","Nov 13, 2021","It is safe to say that, 30 years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the dream of a Greater Europe that once seemed so close has now been completely dashed. This is not because Russia or Europe is against it. In fact, both Russia and Europe are supporters of the idea of a Greater Europe. In particular, since Peter the Great, integration into Europe has become Russia’s emotional and historical complex. Although it has encountered many setbacks, Russia has never given up. Whenever hope arises, this emotion resurges. As an idea, Occidentalism has deep roots in Russia, and it will continue to exist for a long time to come. For many Russians, Europe is Russia’s spiritual home, something Asia has never been and cannot be. This is determined by Russia’s cultural genes and cannot be changed. Although this does not indicate that Russia will have better relations with Europe than with Asia in terms of relations between states."
The Pendulum of History——International Politics 30 Years After the Collapse of the Soviet Union,"Russian, East European & Central Asian Studies , Zhao Huasheng","Nov 13, 2021","After the Ukrainian crisis in 2014, Europe saw Russia’s annexation of Crimea as the use of force to change national borders, overturning the international order in post-Cold War Europe. The EU unilaterally froze the main mechanisms of economic and political cooperation with Russia, including bilateral summits and consultations between EU member states and the Russian government, and imposed severe sanctions on Russian financial and industrial entities. At the same time, the NATO-Russia Council also ceased activities, and Russian-European relations fell into their most serious crisis since the end of the Cold War. In this context, Russia “turned to the East,” subsequently proposing the Greater Eurasian Partnership. However, the turn to the East indicates that Russia has increased its attention to the East, but this does not mean it has abandoned Europe. Russia’s turn to the East does not mean leaving Europe, nor does it mean replacing Europe with Asia. It just involves strengthening development to the East, striking a better balance between Europe and Asia, and greater diversification in economy, technology, investment, and energy markets. Greater Eurasia and Greater Europe are not contradictory and mutually exclusive concepts. The relationship between these concepts can be interpreted in two ways: The first interpretation is that Greater Eurasia and Greater Europe are parallel concepts, applicable to both directions of Russian diplomacy. Greater Europe is applicable to the European direction, and Greater Eurasia is applicable to the Eurasian direction. Greater Eurasia and Greater Europe are two distinct parts that can be connected. The second interpretation is that Greater Eurasia is an extension and upgrade of the concept of Greater Europe. The concept of Greater Eurasia includes Europe, making it conceptually larger than Greater Europe.
In fact, the official Russian concept of Greater Eurasia contained this idea from the very beginning. The concept of Greater Eurasia can better reflect Russia’s autonomy and subjectivity than Greater Europe. In diplomatic terms, it is a revision and balance to Greater Europe. However, regardless of the interpretation, Greater Eurasia does not deny the idea of Greater Europe. Its only questions whether it is possible for Russia to join hands with Europe. The belief is that, if there is a historical opportunity for Russia and Europe to join hands, whether it is the linkage of Greater Eurasia with Greater Europe or the pulling of Europe into Greater Eurasia, Russia will welcome the chance with open arms."

After experiencing the eastward expansion of NATO, the Kosovo war, the Russo-Georgian war, the Ukrainian crisis, and various other problems in succession, Russian-European relations have deteriorated so deeply that the foundation on which to build a Greater Europe no longer exists. In addition, there is still a major problem between Russia and Europe, that is, in what form and in what capacities should Russia and Europe build a Greater Europe. Although both sides agree with the idea of Greater Europe as an abstract concept, there is a difference in principles in their understanding of it at a practical level. The Greater Europe they imagine present different pictures."

The European vision of Greater Europe is based on Russia’s acceptance of Europe’s political framework, security framework, and value system. This is equivalent to the expansion of European-led political and security institutions to Russia, so that Russia would be brought under the European-led framework. The two sides also differ markedly in their understanding of their identities. From Russia’s point of view, it will have an independent role in Greater Europe as a peer of equal status with Europe. Europe, on the contrary, does not accept the equal status of Russia. The EU and NATO are collective identities, while Russia is a single state. Granting Russia equal status with the EU and NATO would mean giving it veto power over the EU and NATO, which the EU and NATO will not accept. Russia is also willing to use the Eurasian Economic Union as an equal partner of the EU and the Collective Security Treaty Organization as an equal partner of NATO, but the EU and NATO do not agree with this. As a result, the European vision of a Greater Europe is incommensurate to that of Russia in terms of form and identity. However, Russia will not give up its independent and equal status in Greater Europe, and will not accept its integration into Europe as a vassal of Europe.

The growing middle class, on the one hand, reflects the great achievements of China’s reform and opening up and socialist construction; on the other hand, it also puts forward higher requirements for public management and social governance.

In 2015, the 2015 Global Wealth Report released by Credit Suisse pointed out that the total wealth of Chinese households reached 22.8 trillion U.S. dollars, surpassing Japan to become the second richest country in the world, second only to the United States. At the same time, China has the largest middle-class population in the world, reaching 109 million, surpassing the 92 million middle-class population in the United States. The Chinese middle class accounts for 11% of the national adult population and 16% of the global middle class. The report defines the “middle class” with assets ranging from 50,000 to 500,000 U.S. dollars (about 317,000 to 3.17 million yuan).

Personal wealth is more opaque than income. A major change in today’s society is that the importance of property, especially real estate, to social stratification is increasing, while the role of wage income is declining. Wan Haiyuan and Li Shi’s research found that housing prices are the main reason for property growth. After deducting the housing price factor, the total property value of residents drops by 40%. In first- and second-tier cities, rising housing prices accounted for 38% of the property Gini coefficient.

(2) Mixed classes, mainly unit-based communities where different classes mixed within a given space; the flow between classes was relatively easy and frequent.

However, the growth of the middle class has also brought new challenges to our public management. The biggest challenges are: First, the quality of officials in Chinese history had an obvious advantage over the subjects of governance. However, with the expansion of the middle class, this advantage has been weakened or even partially reversed: A considerable number of the subjects under management have economic income, education, and even international standards, such that their goals go beyond ordinary civil servants. Second, the middle class has higher requirements for the level of public services and the institutionalization of government behavior, and the traditional extensive public management model has become out of date.

The Political Tendencies of the Chinese Middle Class and Its Influence on Public Opinion,"Journal of Xiangtan University , Xiong Yihan","Sep 1, 2019","Whether the middle class is politically conservative or radical has always been debated in academic circles. Zhou Xiaohong believes that China’s emerging middle class is mainly interested in economic wealth. Rather than political rights, he characterized the Chinese middle class as “consumption avant-garde, political rearguard.”8 Li Peilin and Zhang Yi found that, compared with other classes, the middle class criticized the current social and political situation more, and lacked trust in government behavior. 9 In the author’s opinion, the conservative and radical aspects of the middle class are “contextualized.” At the day to day, the middle class shows more conservative aspects, which is due to their interests and the system. Once their interests are substantially damaged, the middle class will also take to the streets. Citizens in Xiamen, Dalian, Ningbo, and other places opposed the construction of the PX project by means of group walks, and parents in Nanjing and Wuhan collectively protested the reduction of the college entrance examination indicators. 10"

As the backbone members of a unit, they face enormous work pressure and have no time to participate in public life; as fans of consumer culture, they are rational economic animals; as beneficiaries of the current system, they yearn for stability and fear that reforms will affect their vested interests."
The Political Tendencies of the Chinese Middle Class and Its Influence on Public Opinion,"Journal of Xiangtan University , Xiong Yihan","Sep 1, 2019","On the one hand, the middle class often exhibits a certain degree of political apathy. In the election of deputies to grassroots people’s congresses and community elections, it is often difficult to see the figure of the middle class; the self-governance of residents and the self-government of owners are also ineffective because of the “silent majority” and are criticized by others. On the other hand, the middle class is keen to discuss politics, paying attention to major personnel changes and political events, and various political gossip is widely circulated in circles of friends. Rather than saying that the middle class does not care about politics, it is better to say that the middle class lacks low-cost but effective channels for political participation."
The Political Tendencies of the Chinese Middle Class and Its Influence on Public Opinion,"Journal of Xiangtan University , Xiong Yihan","Sep 1, 2019","Home and children are the top concerns of the middle class. The middle class cares about their homes: It is their shelter, and it is also the main way for them to maintain and increase the value of their assets. The home is a symbol of a sense of security and achievement. The middle class cares about the education of their children, and attaching importance to education is a common feature of East Asian society, though China’s middle class pays particular attention to investment in education due to status anxiety. Housing policies, educational equity, and social mobility are issues of particular concern to the middle class. On these three issues, the middle class has a very contradictory psychology and lacks clear policy appeals. On the one hand, they think that housing prices are too high and call themselves “housing slaves.” On the other hand, they are very worried that the housing price will fall and their interests will be damaged. They advocate fairness in education in concept but are often wary of education reform, disapprove of college entrance examinations in different places, and do not want their children to become classmates with migrant children. They criticize class rigidity, but they fear that their children are at risk of downward mobility."
The Political Tendencies of the Chinese Middle Class and Its Influence on Public Opinion,"Journal of Xiangtan University , Xiong Yihan","Sep 1, 2019","At the same time, we also found that the middle class is closely related to social movements. The driving force of social movements, such as the homeowners’ rights movements, environmental movement, Not-In-My-Back-Yard (NIMBY) movement, feminist movement, gay rights movement, and animal rights movement, is the middle class. The participation of the middle class in social movements or group events may be due to substantial damage to their interests, such as protesting against the construction of substations, waste incineration plants, and PX projects near their own communities or because of specific values, such as opposing the Nujiang Hydropower Project. Compared with the lower class, the middle class has higher requirements for the environment. The western world usually thinks that the middle class is closely related to the democratization movement but from the current point of view, the middle class in China does not show a strong appeal for Western-style democracy. Rather, they have a higher demand for procedural justice such as the rule of law, openness, and transparency. The middle class has a relatively developed social network, including informal groups formed based on occupation, academic relationships, consumption, and residence, but the overall degree of organization is low and its influence on public policy is mainly formed through public opinion rather than social media. At present, the social movements of the middle class are mainly local and small-scale."

Among the seven boiling points of public opinion, two were primary issues, that is, issues that could be discovered without excessive association, and five were secondary issues, that is, they were not directly related to the vaccine incident and required in-depth exploration or were even issues that could only be formed by taking advantage of the incident."

In addition, the higher the education level, the greater the probability of preference for liberalism. 12 The middle class in China is also mainly distributed in the developed coastal areas and has received relatively good levels of education. This survey result supports the judgment that the middle class as a whole leans to the right to a certain extent. The main reason for this is the marketization and globalization brought about by the reform and opening up in 1978, and the idea of liberalism is highly compatible with marketization and globalization.

The main force of the anti-Japanese demonstrations in 2012 changed from students and white-collar workers to migrant workers, and while nationalism has had a greater impact on the middle class, their response has been relatively rational. On the one hand, this is because they have a higher level of education and had gone beyond the simplistic thinking of us versus them. On the other hand, people with higher incomes are more likely to go beyond the constraints of space and borders, and their vision is more international."
The Political Tendencies of the Chinese Middle Class and Its Influence on Public Opinion,"Journal of Xiangtan University , Xiong Yihan","Sep 1, 2019","What needs to be emphasized is that in today’s China, the biggest ideology is neither liberalism, nor nationalism and much less left-wing ideology. In the author’s opinion, the most influential trend of thought is actually developmentalism, that is, the development concept with economic growth at its core, which is the most important social reality since the reform and opening up forty years ago. Because of its strong pragmatism, we have boldly adopted all systems and policies that are beneficial to economic development. Although China’s middle class has more distinct values than the general public, they still have strong materialistic tendencies, and their political attitudes largely depend on their economic status."
The Political Tendencies of the Chinese Middle Class and Its Influence on Public Opinion,"Journal of Xiangtan University , Xiong Yihan","Sep 1, 2019","In addition, the middle class is a contradictory body with both a sense of privilege and equality. They are both the beneficiaries of the current system and have a certain reflection on the system, which determines their lack of clear and consistent positions and demands on many issues. Their ideology is strongly mixed, neither completely Western nor completely consistent with the mainstream ideology advocated by the government. They have received relatively good levels of education and demand more equal relations between officials and citizens, a more transparent policy process, and a more open social system. They also, however, have certain social resources and occasionally enjoy some “minor privileges” and hope that the government’s decision-making process can prioritize their interests. For example, the middle class generally agrees with the rigorous anti-corruption campaign. However, they also feel that anti-corruption has brought some inconvenience to their lives, limiting their opportunities for “minor corruption” and increasing the time cost of administrative approval."

However, some local risks cannot be ruled out. The main risk points include shocks in the real estate market and securities market, rising unemployment caused by economic downturn, and illegal fund-raising. These risks are primarily economic rather than political."

The Political Tendencies of the Chinese Middle Class and Its Influence on Public Opinion,"Journal of Xiangtan University , Xiong Yihan","Sep 1, 2019","The expansion of the middle class is an important achievement of China’s economic development and an important symbol of China’s rise. The political leanings of the middle class are “contextualized.” On the whole, the middle class is rational and moderate, relatively restrained on nationalist issues, and highly concerned with development, rights, the environment, health, and other issues. Should their major interests be infringed upon, the middle class not only has the potential for strong collective actions, they also have a significant influence on public opinion. The political orientation of the middle class dominates the direction of public opinion to a certain extent."
The Political Tendencies of the Chinese Middle Class and Its Influence on Public Opinion,"Journal of Xiangtan University , Xiong Yihan","Sep 1, 2019","The middle class is a class that has a strong demand for information freedom and information disclosure. The middle class likes to make independent judgments on public affairs, rather than passively accepting “second-hand judgments.” To make independent judgments, they need a certain amount of information and relatively comprehensive sources of information. In the process of seeking justice, the lower class are more concerned with “discussing their opinions,” 13 that is, “qualifying” their own experiences and giving a “conclusion” (e.g., “I ask the government to decide whether I am a good person and whether I have been wronged”). In the arena of public opinion, the middle class needs factual information more urgently than such a conclusion (e.g., “You (the government and the mass media) tell me the facts first”)."
The Political Tendencies of the Chinese Middle Class and Its Influence on Public Opinion,"Journal of Xiangtan University , Xiong Yihan","Sep 1, 2019","At the level of legislation and law enforcement, both the ruling party and the government must stabilize the property expectations of the middle class and effectively protect property rights. Property security is their top concern. Special attention should be paid to the fact that part of the middle class has also joined the wave of overseas immigration that used to be dominated by the wealthy. Due to the unregulated market, the unsound rule of law and the rent-seeking behavior of power, a considerable part of the middle class lacks a sense of security in property and is in a state of mental anxiety."
"The Post-Russia-Ukraine Conflict World: Not a “Splitting into Camps,” but Rather a “Small Divergence”","China Foundation for International Studies , Feng Yujun","Jul 22, 2022","In the future, the world will not be re-divided into two opposing hostile camps as it was during the Cold War, although there is a risk of camps forming again. Therefore, we can summarize the international trend since the Russia-Ukraine conflict began as that of a “small divergence.” That is: an accelerated disruption and reorganization of the global supply and production chains brought about by the post-Cold War wave of globalization; continuous renewal and reworking of global trade and investment rules; and reform and reshaping of global and regional security architecture. Given the important differences in the strategic positioning of the United States toward China and Russia, the risk of “re-campification” (再阵营化) of the world will be greatly reduced as long as China maintains a clear strategic mind and strategic determination."

Some people exclaim that a “new Cold War” is approaching at an accelerated pace, and the world will be re-divided into two opposing hostile camps. I do not agree with this overly simplistic analogy.

The Cold War was a prolonged period of confrontation between two evenly matched superpowers, a tense standoff between two military blocs, a contention between two rival ideologies, and a non-interaction between two parallel markets. At present, although there is a strategic game going on between China and the United States and a fierce geopolitical conflict between Russia and the United States and Europe, there is no life-and-death ideological conflict, nor is it possible to form two military blocs with clearly demarcated camps, much less two parallel markets that are perpetually estranged from each other. At the same time, however, we cannot help but see the real risk of renewed division into camps. There will always be forces in the world that expect and even push incessantly for armed conflict and confrontation between camps or even for large-scale war, because only then can they maintain or obtain power, money, or psychological satisfaction."
"The Post-Russia-Ukraine Conflict World: Not a “Splitting into Camps,” but Rather a “Small Divergence”","China Foundation for International Studies , Feng Yujun","Jul 22, 2022","So, how should we summarize the international strategic reality and trends at present and over the next decade? I would like to borrow the concept of “Great Divergence” from Kenneth Pomeranz’s definition of the late 18th and early 19th centuries when the East and the West began to gradually take different development paths, with the West taking the lead in transforming into modern industrial societies while China maintained its existing development path, and summarize the post-Russia-Ukraine conflict international trend as a “small divergence.”"
"The Post-Russia-Ukraine Conflict World: Not a “Splitting into Camps,” but Rather a “Small Divergence”","China Foundation for International Studies , Feng Yujun","Jul 22, 2022",The “small divergence” is primarily manifested in three ways.
"The Post-Russia-Ukraine Conflict World: Not a “Splitting into Camps,” but Rather a “Small Divergence”","China Foundation for International Studies , Feng Yujun","Jul 22, 2022","First is the accelerated disruption and restructuring of the global production and supply chains that were brought about by the post-Cold War wave of globalization. Following the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the economic sanctions imposed on Russia by a series of countries, international organizations, and multinational companies have accelerated the loosening of production and supply chains linked to Russia, and the “de-Russification” of the world economy has gained obvious momentum. Even in the energy sector, which is so important and which Russia once thought was rock-solid, its position has suffered a huge impact. The United States has imposed an energy embargo on Russia, and the European Union has made the important decision to cut Russian natural gas imports by two-thirds and oil imports by 90% this year, and to largely eliminate its energy dependence on Russia by 2027. This will undoubtedly lead to a “lose-lose” outcome. But in the context of the ongoing war, there is no doubt that high politics concerns have outweighed low politics issues like economic and energy cooperation. While “de-Russification” is currently in the spotlight, the decoupling from China, especially high-tech decoupling, that began with the U.S.-China trade war, has not been effectively curbed, and the COVID-19 pandemic and control measures that have lasted for three years are further alienating China from the world economic system."
"The Post-Russia-Ukraine Conflict World: Not a “Splitting into Camps,” but Rather a “Small Divergence”","China Foundation for International Studies , Feng Yujun","Jul 22, 2022","Second is the continuous renewal and reworking of global trade and investment rules. In recent years, the WTO has been subject to many questions, and its regulatory role in international trade and investment has clearly weakened. At the same time, new sets of bilateral and multilateral global trade and investment rules are quietly developing in parallel. CPTPP, the new United States-Canada-Mexico FTA, United States-Japan FTA, and EU-Japan FTA are already up and running, and movement forward on a United States-Europe FTA and an Indo-Pacific Economic Framework is accelerating. The Russia-Ukraine conflict will accelerate the global “divergence” trend, and one cannot rule out the possibility of the G7 joining a group of emerging economies and even developing countries in forming a large market with zero tariffs, zero barriers, and zero subsidies in the future, and other “non-market economies” such as Russia basically being excluded from the world’s mainstream economic system."
"The Post-Russia-Ukraine Conflict World: Not a “Splitting into Camps,” but Rather a “Small Divergence”","China Foundation for International Studies , Feng Yujun","Jul 22, 2022","Third is the reform and reshaping of global and regional security architecture. At the global level, many countries around the world have raised serious questions about the declining effectiveness of the UN Security Council in maintaining global and regional security in recent years. On April 26, the 76th session of the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution co-sponsored by 83 countries stipulating that if one or more of the five permanent members of the Security Council use their veto in the Security Council, the President of the General Assembly shall convene a plenary session within 10 working days to review the veto, allowing all member countries to review and comment on the act of using the veto. This means that the five permanent members must shoulder more responsibility when using the veto. It is actually a disguised way to limit the power of the five permanent members and give more power to the UN General Assembly, and it would significantly affect the functioning of the UN. In the future, the reform of the United Nations, including the Security Council, may accelerate, which would have a major impact on the global security governance system that formed after World War II with the Security Council as the main framework."
"The Post-Russia-Ukraine Conflict World: Not a “Splitting into Camps,” but Rather a “Small Divergence”","China Foundation for International Studies , Feng Yujun","Jul 22, 2022","In Europe, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has caused a revitalization after years of crises—the sovereign debt crisis, refugee crisis, and Brexit crisis. NATO has also been roused by the war to emerge from its so-called “brain dead” state and play a more important role in European security affairs. The United States’ position in the transatlantic security system has also risen further. This means that the state of Russian-European relations since the end of the Cold War, which despite long-standing discord could be just about maintained, will come to an end, and a new divide is re-emerging in Europe. However, this is not the Cold War period’s “iron curtain” between two evenly matched rival camps, but a barrier by which the vast majority of European countries “isolate” Russia."
"The Post-Russia-Ukraine Conflict World: Not a “Splitting into Camps,” but Rather a “Small Divergence”","China Foundation for International Studies , Feng Yujun","Jul 22, 2022","The Russia-Ukraine conflict has also had a spillover effect on Asia-Pacific security, with some countries viewing China and Russia as one and the same, and one-sidedly believing that China is supporting Russia’s so-called military operation against Ukraine. Influenced by such a misreading, the United States has further stepped up its efforts to reshape the Indo-Pacific security system, striving to build a multi-level, multi-format, multi-field, cross-regional Indo-Pacific security mechanism and strengthen its extended deterrence in the Indo-Pacific region to address the so-called “comprehensive China challenge.”"
"The Post-Russia-Ukraine Conflict World: Not a “Splitting into Camps,” but Rather a “Small Divergence”","China Foundation for International Studies , Feng Yujun","Jul 22, 2022","It must be noted, however, that there are still important differences in the strategic positioning of the United States towards China and Russia, and the strengthening of its Indo-Pacific alliance system is more preventive than offensive in nature. At the same time, on a number of recent important diplomatic occasions, China has reiterated its strategic position on Sino-Russian relations as being “non-aligned, non-confrontational and non-targeted.” China has always criticized the “Cold War mentality” and does not want the world to fall back into “confrontation between camps.” In fact, there are many differences between China and Russia in terms of national strength, identity, strategic goals, and relationships with the world system. As long as China maintains a clear strategic mind and strategic determination, the risk of a “re-campification” of the world will be greatly reduced."

We hope that the world’s politicians will show wisdom, conscience, and courage, so that this period of “small divergence” will end as soon as possible, allowing a more vigorous, more balanced, and fairer wave of globalization to take hold, and for a community of human destiny with coexistence and shared prosperity to be collectively built."
The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","The Biden administration will soon complete its first year, and its China policy is already basically clear. Chinese leaders have made many earnest efforts to work on [the relationships with] the United States and have emphasized that the stability and development of Sino-U.S. relations are not an “optional question”, but a “required question” indispensable to the historical trend of peace and prosperity of the two peoples and the world. However, the Biden administration proceeds from the maintenance of the hegemonic position and interests of the United States. Based on the facts of “internal turmoil” (内卷化) such as severe political and social opposition and division, the severe COVID-19 pandemic, and the high inflation rate in the United States, they are trying to use the policy of comprehensive and in-depth confrontation and suppression of China to score a political victory (执政亮点). They also want to restore the central role of the United States in the global high-tech manufacturing production chain and supply chain through a hard-line “decoupling” policy towards China. In doing so, the United States intends to substantially weaken China’s manufacturing upgrade and high-tech progress, in an attempt to reopen the gap in power between the United States and China."
The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","The previous U.S. policy of engagement with China has been replaced by a multi-pronged policy of comprehensively suppressing China’s rise. This is the inevitable choice of the United States to combat China’s rising momentum and increasing power. The high-tech R&D and cutting-edge manufacturing fields have actually become the main battlefields of the United State’s “new containment strategy” against China. In order to achieve this strategic aim, the Biden administration emphasized that the main competition in the world today is the contest between the United States and Western democracies with “heterogeneous” (异质) countries represented by China and Russia. They will not hesitate to “demonize” China so that the United States can win over its allies and partner countries to form an “Anti-China Alliance.” At the same time, Biden has advocated the adoption of a series of legislative measures in the United States to improve infrastructure and increase social spending and calls for plans such as “Build Back Better World” (B3W), paving the way for the “reindustrialization” of the United States."

Sino-U.S. relations already cannot return to their former state.

The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","Since the end of the Cold War, and even in the era of engagement with China, the China policies of successive U.S. administrations have, without exception, placed equal emphasis on economic cooperation and the national security interest of “marking China” [盯防中国, sports term meaning marking the strongest player out for special attention of the defense]. Even in the 1990s, when Clinton reinstated China’s most-favored-nation status for trade, welcomed China’s “accession to the WTO,” expanded Sino-U.S. economic and trade exchanges, and accepted Chinese investment in the United States, China was always the country with the second-strictest controls in the U.S. export control list. In its engagement with China, the United States’ policy has always been to prohibit the export of military technology and equipment to China, as well as the export of dual-use technologies. In other words, even with the rapid expansion and improvement of Sino-U.S. trade and economic exchanges starting in the late 1990s, China has always been the object of severe scrutiny on the U.S. national security agenda, and restricting the upgrade of China’s armaments and strategic competitiveness has always been a core element of U.S. policy toward China."
The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","In addition to China, by the mid-1990s, two important factors—the threat to national security in international economic competition and the pursuit of U.S. hegemony—have always driven the basic response whereby U.S. policymakers focused on maintaining the U.S.-dominated unipolar structures after the Cold War by integrating economic and security policies. The place of economic security in the national security strategy of the United States has never been overlooked. The Biden administration’s current suppression of China in economics and advanced technology is a unilateral and hegemonic approach aimed at the legitimate commercial competitiveness of the Chinese economy and the unobstructed expansion of “national security” (国家安全化, national securitization) to encompass the economy and technology."
The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","For the United States, as the defending hegemonic power since World War II, economic security has always been the pillar of U.S. national security. Edward Mead Earle pointed out that the relationship between the economy and security “has been the most critical and fascinating issue in statecraft since the rise of nation-states, the expansion of European civilization, the outbreak of the Industrial Revolution, and the steady improvement of military technology.” [Translator’s note: The original source of most quotations from English sources in this document could not be found due to the lack of references. In these cases, the Chinese translation has been translated back into English] With the end of the Cold War, the boundaries between Eastern and Western countries disappeared, globalization accelerated, the degree of interdependence among countries has continued to deepen, and economic security has gradually separated from military security to become a relatively independent field, receiving increasing attention by American policymakers. This is intuitively reflected in the National Security Strategies submitted to Congress by successive U.S. presidents."
The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","The Reagan administration suggested that the United States’ “reliance on foreign supply sources has increased in many key areas, and potential supply chain vulnerabilities are a problem deserving attention.” The Clinton administration gave the connection between the economy and national security greater status, arguing that the United States’ “economic and security interests are inextricably linked. Prosperity at home depends on our leadership in the global economy. The strength of our diplomacy, our ability to maintain an unrivaled military, the attractiveness of our values abroad all depend in part on the strength of our economy.” Although the Obama administration had experienced the impact of the financial crisis, it still emphasized the liberal international order and believed that, “the U.S. economy is not only an engine of global economic growth and a source of stability for the international system, but also a key indicator of our military strength and diplomatic influence. A strong economy combined with the United States’ prominent position in the international financial system will effectively enhance national security.”"

The Trump administration emphasized: “Economic security is an important part of national security, and economic means have also become an important component of a country’s diplomatic means.” After Biden took office, he emphasized that the United States should return to “world leadership,” and attempted to change the negative impression that the unilateralism and new isolationism in U.S. diplomacy during the Trump administration had on the world. However, the Biden administration inherited the Trump administration’s emphasis that U.S. national security needs to fully return to the “state-centric” mode of struggle in the face of China’s rise. From the very beginning of his presidency, Biden made it clear that economic security is national security and that the “traditional boundaries between domestic and foreign policy and between national security, economic security, health security, and environmental security should be broken down to deal with the current new situation.”"

Even more, it has determined the United States’ revaluation of Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations—from a ballast stone in bilateral relations, they have become a “direct threat” to U.S. national security. In the face of a powerful rising China, the United States has historically “redefined” China—A China that is starting to become strong is a “heterogeneous” country that “intentionally” challenges the current international order and competes with the United States for dominance in international affairs. Since the late Obama administration, the United States began to domestically question and reconsider its China policy. After Trump took office, he officially characterized China as a “revisionist country” and a primary “strategic competitor.” The Trump administration’s National Security Strategy report states: “Inter-state strategic competition, not terrorism, is now the primary concern in U.S. national security.” The Biden administration more explicitly stated that: “China, in particular, has rapidly become more assertive. It is the only competitor potentially capable of combining its economic, diplomatic, military, and technological power to mount a sustained challenge to a stable and open international system.” “Dealing with China’s challenge” has become the basic consensus of U.S. political and academic circles across the left, center, and right."

It is an attempt to start again from a strategy of prioritizing U.S. national security interests, limit and reduce the commercial dependence of the United States and its European and East Asian allies on China, try to reduce the economic costs of the strategic confrontation with China, and curb the momentum of China’s rise in the industrial and high-tech fields. To this end, the Biden administration’s “strategic competition” with China, on the one hand, draws ideological lines and organizes geopolitical “cliques”. On the other hand, it starts with the simultaneous separation between geoeconomics and geotechnology and creation of confrontation, simultaneously suppresses China from the “four major areas” of human rights, security, economics and trade, and science and technology, and plan a geostrategic layout to allow the United States to continue to isolate and contain China."
The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","The cross-spatial nature of high-tech competition has changed the traditional geopolitical model of great power competition, with the importance of seizing strategic locations dropping significantly and the losses incurred by military occupation of raw material sources increasingly outweighing the gains. Advanced technology has amplified long-range force projection capabilities and long-range military strike capabilities, making territorial competition no longer necessary. The pattern of geographic competition between the United States and the Soviet Union in the Third World during the Cold War no longer has any meaning in contemporary times. Unlike the competition between the United States and Soviet Union during the Cold War, the current competition between China and the United States must be considered in the context of the “Fourth Industrial Revolution.” Klaus Schwab has pointed out that all the new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, Internet of Things, autonomous driving, 3D printing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, materials science, energy storage, and quantum computing that together drive the so-called “Fourth Industrial Revolution” will become key factors in great-power competition in the new era. The current competition between China and the United States is a multi-dimensional and comprehensive competition in the fields of security and economics. As a key link between the two fields of security and economics, advanced technology is becoming the main field of great-power competition between China and the United States, and completion for dominance in the field of advanced technology has become the focus of current Sino-U.S. competition."
The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","First, high-tech and cutting-edge manufacturing has become the core driving force for the strategic capacity building of great powers. Kenneth Waltz has pointed out that the U.S.-Soviet arms race during the Cold War was “the largest-scale use of military technology at the forefront of science and technology to widen the gap with opponents. Moreover, these modern weapon systems raised the threshold for other countries to join the superpower club. Unable to approach the technological R&D level of the United States and the Soviet Union, middle powers will continue to lag behind.” Winning a dominant position in military power by promoting the iterative update of military technology was the internal driving force of U.S.-Soviet competition during the Cold War. With the decline of the Soviet Union in the 1980s, it no longer had the ability to challenge the United States in the field of science and technology, and Japan, which had the ability to challenge the United States in the field of science and technology, was a staunch ally of the United States and did not pose a security threat. In the 1990s, the prosperity of the Internet economy and the drastic changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe objectively promoted the accelerated development of globalization and brought about the global spread of emerging technologies. Assisted by the international trade system and the global division of industrial labor system formed after World War II, emerging technologies have gradually spread to all countries as part of global industrial transfers. This has also profoundly changed the internal driving force of strategic competition among great powers."
The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","The difference between Sino-U.S. great-power competition and U.S.-Soviet competition of hegemony is that competition between China and the United States focuses more on the use of advanced technology to develop their own economies to gain economic power. Rather than a competition for military dominance, it is a competition for economic leadership. At the same time, advanced technology is also constantly promoting the upgrade of military equipment and thus affecting the balance of power between China and the United States. China’s great progress in high-tech fields has not only driven the development of related industries and reduced its gap with the United States, but also allowed China to achieve the modernization and upgrading of military equipment by leveraging its scientific and technological progress, giving it the ability to threaten American hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region. The dual role of advanced technology in the economic and security fields makes it the core and internal driving force of the strategic power of today’s great powers."
The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","In addition, the policy and strategy elites of the Biden administration are very clear that, without the gradual “de-Sinification” of advanced technology and production chains, the United States will always have to bear a high price in strategic confrontation with China. In the current strategic competition between China and the United States, in addition to the “Three Seas Linkage” (三海联动) tensions in the Taiwan Strait, the South China Sea, and the East China Sea and the increased U.S. military pressure on China, the openness and cooperation in the fields of economics and science and technology is still a force fighting against locking-out and decoupling. The Trump administration’s measures to contain China’s rise are mainly manifested in the unilateral reliance of the United States on its dominant position to carry out a hegemonic trade war against China and impose sanctions on Huawei and other Chinese high-tech companies. Ignoring WTO rules and related international norms and restrictions, they attempted to achieve the comprehensive suppression of China in economics and science and technology. However, while adopting a hard-line policy toward China, the Trump administration alienated allies and “withdrew” from international organizations. As a result, they were criticized that their China policy was more of an attitude than a strategy. After Biden took office, the U.S. policy of strategic competition with China positioned the Sino-U.S. relationship as a relationship of “competitive interdependence,” focusing on coordinating and organizing its allies and partner countries to build an “anti-China alliance.” The Biden administration has not only indiscriminately attacked China’s human rights, but also defined China’s policy of economic and trade openness as “aggressive and coercive abuse of economic power” that is a violation of “intellectual property rights and global governance.” At the same time, when it is in the interests of the United States, China is required to strengthen cooperation with the United States on issues such as climate change and nuclear arms control. Biden’s policy of “strategic competition” with China emphasizes “Build Back Better World” plans to spur domestic economic resurgence, such as increasing infrastructure improvements, expanding social spending, and rebuilding the U.S. high-tech industrial economy. This is supplemented by practices such as uniting allies and partners, renewing its role in international organizations, and restoring the U.S. international reputation damaged by Trump. Together, this is an attempt to comprehensively consolidate and expand the strategic advantages of the United States relative to China."

Economically, [the administration seeks to] increase investment in domestic infrastructure and key industries to enhance domestic economic competitiveness, increase the protection of core technologies through the approach of “exclusive yards with high walls” [小院高墙, a new term from Xi Jinping’s speech to the World Economic Forum], widen the technological gap with China, and maintain a long-term competitive advantage over China. Militarily, [the administration seeks to] consolidate and expand the U.S. alliance system in the Indo-Pacific region, make full use of the U.S.-Japan and U.S.-South Korea bilateral alliances, upgrade the “quadrilateral mechanism” among the United States, Japan, India, and Australia, and activate the intelligence sharing function of the “Five Eyes alliance” to create a wall of encirclement around China. In the field of economy and security, [the administration seeks to] rationalize the legal basis for sanctions imposed by the executive branch, coordinate with Congress to enact legislation, and cut off China’s military-civil fusion development path as a means to hinder China’s military scientific and technological progress and military modernization. In this series of deployments, the comprehensive containment of China in the high-tech field has become the focus of the Biden administration’s China policy."

The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","Since the Biden administration came to power, it has continued to implement the strategy of “decoupling” from China in fields that are of core significance to future global industrial development, such as 5G, chips, electric vehicles, renewable energy technologies, and products, using human rights and security as a pretext. This is done to ensure the re-emergence in the United States of the industrial policies and green economy policies pushed by Biden after taking office and to ensure the dominant position of the United States in the global manufacturing landscape. To this end, Biden is trying to build an institutionalized policy system for competition with China through Congress, simultaneously working to unite allies to jointly contain China, and conducting strategic competition with China in the field of science and technology based on the idea of “extreme competition.”"
The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","First, they are trying to create a hard-line anti-China legislative system featuring “coordination of the government and society.” Following the tone set by the United States’ smearing of human rights in China, they have continuously launched related projects that restrict or even prohibit normal business, investment, technology, and educational exchanges between the United States and China, and through various legislative measures, the exchanges and connections that have been formed between the two countries have been vigorously reduced within the U.S. government and social system. At present, the Democratic Party has a majority in both the House of Representatives and Senate. Before the 2022 mid-term congressional elections, the Biden administration has a window in which it can continuously obtain legislative approval and support for its policy agenda. The Biden administration is working hard to bring together majorities in both houses of Congress in the form of a bipartisan bill to build an institutional system that suppresses Chinese advanced technology, restricts normal exchanges between the two countries, and carries out excessive “national securitization” in relations with China. The U.S. Senate passed the United States Innovation and Competition Act of 2021 (USICA) on June 8, 2021, with a vote of 68 to 32. This bill, which is exceptional for its extremely targeted nature, aims to expand investment in industry and science and technology in order to meet the challenge posed by China. Biden praised this as the result of a bipartisan effort. The USICA also includes main elements of his “American Jobs Plan.” On August 10 of the same year, after months of bipartisan negotiations, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed the Senate by a vote of 69 to 30. Biden pointed out that, along with his push to “Build Back Better World,” the infrastructure investment plan will create approximately 2 million jobs each year over the next decade. To reduce resistance, Biden did not hesitate to focus the investments in the bill on the core infrastructure areas that Republicans value more, and correspondingly reduce investment in areas of more concern to Democrats such as climate change, racial equality, and health care."
The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","Creating a policy system of “coordination of the government and society” is an important means for the Biden administration to maintain long-term and institutionalized competition with China in science and technology. The infrastructure bills and innovation policies promoted by the Biden administration are complementary and mutually reinforcing. Because the development of manufacturing is inseparable from a sound and developed infrastructure network, innovation policies not only can drive economic development and create jobs, but also help constrain China’s momentum in core science and technology areas. Therefore, in the process of medium and long-term strategic competition, they will continuously improve the inherent competitiveness of U.S. science and technology and industry."
The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","Second, they are trying to form an “alliance of democratic countries” in the field of science and technology in an attempt to unite more countries in the production chain and supply chain to build “exclusive yards with high walls” directly targeting China. Biden appreciates the strategic significance of his system of allies in containing China. He has said that the allies Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, NATO, Japan, South Korea, and Australia are “the most important assets of the United States.” At the Munich Security Conference, Biden said that they must prepare for a long-term strategic competition with China. This requires a reliance on the global system that the United States has shaped over the past 70 years with allies in Europe and the Indo-Pacific. The Biden administration hopes to build a so-called “alliance of democratic countries” against China under the banners of “democracy” and “human rights” while investing heavily in innovation and infrastructure domestically to revitalize key industries. The “Democratic Ten” (D-10) is a typical example: With the G7 as its main entities, it unites the European Union, Australia, and South Korea to form a group of strategically like-minded and globally influential countries to resist the challenges posed by China and Russia. The D-10 forms technology initiatives to develop conventional standards and more resilient supply chains for advanced technologies, provides channels for rebuilding free and fair trade, and proposes climate initiatives to upgrade green technologies. The Biden administration’s promotion of “values diplomacy” (价值观外交) is an important practice of its multilateral diplomacy strategy. In the field of science and technology, they are putting together a so-called “democratic alliance” to fight against “heterogeneous” China. In essence, they are trying to constrict China’s development space in the field of science and technology, widen the technological gap between China and the United States, and contain the momentum of China’s rise in the high-tech sector."
The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","The “Quadrilateral Security Dialogue” (Quad) of the United States, Japan, India, and Australia has also added new cooperation topics such as climate change, vaccines, cutting-edge technologies, and infrastructure since the Biden administration took office. This means that the Biden administration’s Indo-Pacific strategy not only has a geopolitical alliance posture and a military “anti-China alliance,” but also attempts to build a geoeconomic and geotechnical “anti-China alliance.” On September 24, 2021, the four heads of state of the United States, Japan, India, and Australia held an offline meeting in Washington for the first time. In addition to focusing on traditional topics such as the pandemic, infrastructure, climate, and education, they also expanded the scope of topics to emerging technologies, cybersecurity, and space. Among these topics, with regard to cooperation in the field of technology, it is clearly stated that a joint statement of the four countries will be issued, announcing the establishment of a technical standards liaison group, the launch of semiconductor supply chain initiatives, support for 5G deployment and diversification, and monitoring of biotechnology scanning. The expansion of the functions of the “Quad mechanism” is the result of the Biden administration’s expansion of the boundaries of technological alliances and the formation of a more comprehensive technology and high-tech industry “firewall” against China. It is also a new method in the U.S. science and technology war against China."
The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","On September 29, 2021, the United States and the European Union (EU) announced the establishment of the U.S.-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC). This council will set up ten working groups and strengthen U.S.-EU cooperation in areas such as technology standards, clean technology, supply chain security, ICTS competitiveness, data governance and technology platforms, improper use of technology to threaten security and human rights, export controls, investment reviews, facilitating access to digital tools by SMEs, and global trade challenges. Because Trump’s trade war with China has had little effect, the first phase of the Economic and Trade Agreement signed by the two countries has not been properly implemented due to the impact of the epidemic, and France, Germany, and other EU countries have also avoided launching a full-scale “new cold war” with China, the Biden administration and the EU established the TTC with the aim of narrowing the scope of the attack, selecting key fields of strategic significance, and uniting allies to jointly deal with an “unnamed” adversary—China. The United States is not only winning over Europe, but also stirring up trouble in Asia-Pacific. On October 27, 2021, Biden proposed the “Indo-Pacific Economic Framework” initiative at the East Asia Summit and announced that the United States and its partners would formulate common goals in trade facilitation, digital economy and technology standards, supply chain resilience, low-carbon and clean energy, infrastructure, labor standards, and other areas of mutual interest under the framework. Biden did not elaborate on the specific content and goals of the “Indo-Pacific Economic Framework” initiative at the East Asia Summit. However, over the next two months, senior officials such as Secretary of State Blinken and Secretary of Commerce Raimondo occasionally revealed new information about the framework during their visits to Japan, South Korea, and Southeast Asian countries. Although the details of the “Indo-Pacific Economic Framework” initiative have not been fully disclosed, the initiative reveals that the Biden administration’s version of the “Indo-Pacific Strategy” has begun to significantly add economic and technological bargaining chips. It is a geoeconomic tactic employed by the United States in an attempt to use its allies and partners to weaken and put pressure on China’s current position in the Asia-Pacific economy."

The basic method of the Biden administration’s “extreme competition” with China in the field of science and technology is the attempt to completely ban previously normal contacts and exchanges between China and the United States in the field of advanced technology and continuing the Trump administration’s model of excessive “security-driven” (安全化) thinking. In particular, they have adopted an insane “exclusion policy” for companies, research institutions, and universities that have ties to or cooperate with the Chinese military. After Biden took office, the authority to formulate the “Military End User” List was transferred from the Department of Commerce and the Department of Defense to the Department of the Treasury. The Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the Treasury Department is responsible for the dynamic adjustment of the “Non-SDN Chinese Military-Industry Complex Companies List” (NS-CMIC List). This will help to rationalize the legal basis for the list. Previously, the legal basis for the list was partly derived from executive orders by the President and partly from legislation by Congress, with the issuance of many different directives. Now, it is uniformly enforced by OFAC in accordance with the Code of Federal Regulations."
The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","At the same time, the new “Entity List” released by the U.S. Department of Commerce imposes sanctions on Chinese companies on the grounds of so-called human rights issues in the Xinjiang region and “military involvement.” Judging from the dynamics of adjustments to the “Chinese Military-Industrial Complex” list and the “Entity List,” the Biden administration, while continuing the Trump administration’s thinking as regards sanctions against China, is also making efforts to reduce the arbitrariness of the sanctions list, enhance the coherence of policies, find a “just cause” [师出有名, can also mean a plausible pretext], and strengthen the legal basis for the release of the list."
The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","At the same time, the Biden administration has comprehensively obstructed or even cut off scientific, cultural, and educational exchanges between the two countries. On May 29, 2020, the Trump administration issued an executive order suspending the entry of Chinese students and researchers into the United States, giving the justification that Chinese exchange students stole sensitive U.S. technology to promote the Chinese military modernization. At the same time, the “Seven Sons of National Defense” [国防七子, Chinese universities with close ties to the military] were included in the Entity List, and Chinese students and researchers from national defense universities became the “hardest hit area.” The Biden administration has continued this policy and uses it as an important means of restraining China’s scientific and technological development: From May 4 of the year the U.S. embassy restarted the approval of visa applications to mid-June, the student visa applications of more than 500 Chinese students were rejected. By looking at the distribution of the types of students whose visas were blocked, we can see they have the following characteristics: students from a national defense university or funded by the China Scholarship Council with research fields involving advanced and cutting-edge technology fields such as quantum computing, big data, semiconductors, biotechnology, 5G, nuclear technology, aerospace technology, and AI."
The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","Obstructing and comprehensively restricting the normal education and scientific research exchanges between China and the United States in science and engineering majors was one of the important measures in the Trump administration’s science and technology warfare against China. However, due to the obstacle posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the effect of these policies only materialized under the Biden administration. The scientific research levels and training systems of American colleges and universities in the fields of cutting-edge science and technology are the best in the world. Biden’s move is undoubtedly intended to “take the firewood from under the cauldron” [釜底抽薪, solve a problem at its root] by attacking China in the areas of basic scientific research and talent training in order to weaken China’s scientific research potential."
The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","Fourth, the Biden administration is attempting to “marginalize” China and vigorously promoting their global right to formulate technical standards in order to further restrict the development of innovation in China’s high-tech industries. The Trump administration believed that the Chinese government and enterprises cooperated to compete for dominance in the international market and expand their influence in international institutions and industry organizations. Viewing normal market behavior with such a Cold War mentality inevitably led them to take a hostile view of the achievements of Chinese companies in setting technical standards. Huawei represents the technological peak achieved by Chinese companies in the 5G field. In addition to seizing market share from companies in developed countries, more importantly, Huawei has seized the right to formulate some technical standards in this field, which resulted in frantic suppression by the Trump administration. After taking office, in an exclusive interview with CBS, Biden proposed that he would focus on international rules and conduct “extreme competition” with China. In terms of the fight for the right to set international technical standards, the Biden administration, on the one hand, retained the “security list” (安全清单) initiated by Trump and continued to disrupt the global supply chains of Chinese high-tech companies such as Huawei. On the other hand, at the Munich Security Conference, they called for U.S.-EU cooperation in the fields of cyberspace, AI, and biotechnology to jointly shape industry rules for advanced technologies and behavioral norms. At the U.S.-EU summit, Biden made full use of multilateral and bilateral dialogue mechanisms to repair and strengthen transatlantic relations and advocated for the establishment of a high-level U.S.-EU trade and technology council to strengthen coordination on international standard formulation for AI, Internet of Things, and other emerging technologies."
The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","Technical standards are the basic architecture of industry development and directly affect the position of enterprises in the production chain and value chain. To seize the right to formulate international standards is to master the commanding heights of an industry and the right to have an international voice. This is extremely important for economic interests and strategic significance. The Biden administration is uniting its allies to compete for the right to set standards, which will help developed Western countries maintain their status in the global industrial division of labor system. This is done to achieve the strategic aim of confining Chinese high-tech enterprises to the middle and low end of the global value chain and maintain the technological hegemony of the United States."
The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","Fifth, since the Biden administration took office, it has continued to challenge the bottom line of the one-China policy on the Taiwan issue, encouraged NATO countries to intervene in disputes in the South China Sea, and vigorously strengthened its military presence in the Western Pacific. The posture of military deterrence and containment towards China is becoming increasingly obvious. Of particular note is that the United States is constantly using strategic bargaining chips from the period of the U.S.-Soviet Cold War, and even increasing the geoeconomic implications of the Indo-Pacific strategy to create a dual geopolitical and geoeconomic split in the Asia-Pacific region. This has become an obvious sign that, although the United States says it is currently opposed to a “new Cold War”, the fact is that it is actually preparing to launch a “new Cold War” against China. In September 2021, the United States signed the Trilateral Security Partnership (AUKUS) with Australia and the United Kingdom, committing to build and equip Australia’s nuclear-powered submarine fleet. The significance of AUKUS is that it enhances Australia’s military capabilities to counter the rise of Chinese military power in the Indo-Pacific region. The conclusion of the AUKUS agreement is an important sign that the United States views the Asia-Pacific region as the core region for the “new Cold War” with China. During the U.S.-Soviet Cold War, the United States established the Australia, New Zealand, and United States Security Treaty (ANZUS) for the purpose of defending against the “communist threat.” The signing of the AUKUS agreement signifies that the United States is trying to regroup its strategic assets from the Cold War to contain China. The Quad mechanism of the United States, Japan, India, and Australia that the Biden administration is striving to promote is an attempt to create an Asian version of NATO in the Asia-Pacific region and expand the U.S.-led bilateral alliance to a so-called system of multilateral military alliances to jointly confront China."

Its core content is not only the addition of the “Indo-Pacific Deterrence Initiative” that marks out China as the focus of the global security strategy, but there are also diplomatic and military actions to encourage EU and NATO member states to intervene in regional security hotspots such as the South China Sea. It also has geoeconomic competition tactics that attempt to restore U.S. dominance in commercial and trade relations in the Asia-Pacific region, reduce the economic dependence of countries in the region on China, and force more countries to “choose sides” between the United States and China."

The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","Compared with that of the Trump administration, the Biden administration’s China policy is long-term, comprehensive, and strategic in nature, and its methods and practices are also more vicious. However, the Biden administration still faces many domestic and international uncertainties if it wants to implement a “new Cold War” against Chinese advanced technology and industry in the short term."
The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","First, after Biden took office, he tried to maintain the unity of the Democratic Party in order to push Congress to pass two important bills, the USICA and the Infrastructure Law, but the Democratic Party was divided over the issue of the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan: This led Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Menendez, who is also a Democrat, publicly questioned the Biden administration’s hasty withdrawal of troops. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Jack Reed publicly condemned the failure of the Democratic and Republican administrations in Afghanistan over the past 20 years and said he would hold a hearing on the matter. Republican lawmakers also questioned the Biden administration’s handling of the Afghan withdrawal."
The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","At the same time as the internal divisions within the Democratic Party, social dissatisfaction in the United States is also rising. According to a Gallup poll, due to the issue of the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the satisfaction of the U.S. public with Biden’s administration dropped to 43%, and more than half of the respondents expressed dissatisfaction for the first time, reaching 53%. Together the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the failure of the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan have created the current predicament faced by the Biden administration, but domestic social problems obviously have a more serious impact on the Biden administration. In the 2022 congressional midterm elections, it remains to be seen whether the Democratic Party can retain its majority of seats, and the goal of “coordination of the government and society” will test the ability of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Party Whip James Cliburn to keep the members of their own party in line for a relatively long time. However, the more important issue is whether members of Congress and voters will be satisfied with the Biden administration’s achievements in domestic and foreign affairs."
The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","Second, the implementation of various domestic economic agendas in the Biden administration has met strong resistance, and the existing plan to reshape domestic economic competitiveness faces intense opposition from the Republican Party. Significant uncertainty remains as to whether Biden will be able to achieve his high-tech investment and manufacturing center goals during his presidency. If the Biden administration fails to make voters truly appreciate the practical benefits brought about by policies such as the infrastructure bill and innovation bill before the 2022 congressional midterm elections, this together with the impact of the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan on the reputation of the Biden administration, will likely cause the Democratic Party to lose control of Congress, thereby impacting the advancement of subsequent Biden administration policies. On October 12, 2021, the House of Representatives passed a bill to raise the debt ceiling by U.S. $480 billion, so the Biden administration was able to avoid a shutdown on October 18. However, with the debt ceiling, it is difficult to support the long-term operation of the government, so this was only a short-term solution. As the “big deadline” approached on December 15th, Democrats passed legislation in the House to provide a “one-time” fast-track for bills raising the debt ceiling—A simple majority in the Senate was needed to pass the bill, allowing Congress to pass a bill that would increase the debt ceiling by U.S. $2.5 trillion and avoid a government shutdown. Whether the Biden administration can properly handle the domestic governance crisis and the crisis of confidence will directly affect whether the Democratic Party can maintain its majority after the 2022 midterm elections. If the Democrats lose their majority in Congress, the Republican-led Congress is bound to frustrate Biden’s efforts for the “coordination of the government and society.” This would also adversely affect plans to rebuild the competitiveness of the domestic economy."

As long as China steadily follows its own path, the United States cannot kidnap the hold the world hostage to its hegemonic interests. Biden visited Europe from June 9 to 16, 2021. This was his first trip abroad as president, showing Biden’s emphasis on European allies and his determination to repair transatlantic relations. However, it will be difficult for U.S.-European relations to go back to their previous state. Since the pandemic, the United States and major European countries face the risk of political polarization and social disunity. The increasing inward focus of the various countries has hindered the introduction of foreign policy, the investment of resources, and the implementation of concrete actions. The coordination of U.S. and European interests is confronted with structural contradictions. The room for maneuver and sustainability of U.S. concessions to Europe are uncertain, and it will be difficult to maintain the U.S.-European diplomatic alignment over the long term. The “Quad Mechanism” is trying to become an “Asian version of NATO” to contain China, but U.S. experts have also commented that the “Quad Mechanism” looks more like a loose organization such as the “BRICs” that have trouble working together. Biden wants to build an anti-China alliance. On December 9-10, 2021, the U.S. government held a farcical online “Democracy Summit” attended by more than 110 countries and regions from around the world. Even the U.S. media was full of complaints about the summit, pointing out that, given the tarnished state of America’s own democracy and the world’s still-difficult task of fighting the pandemic, it was a completely inappropriate moment to hold a “Democracy Summit” along ideological lines. The Chinese government firmly pointed out that such a loose “Democracy Summit” aimed at China and Russia was more of a geopolitical farce. The series of unilateral foreign policies such as Trump’s “withdrawal of international organizations” and “broken treaties” has shaken the foundation of the U.S. alliance system and its control over international mechanisms to a certain extent. This makes it actually difficult to simultaneously achieve the strategic intents of restoring U.S. influence and building a values-based alliance system to contain China. The United States wants to force more countries to side with it in the Sino-U.S. strategic competition, which is even more damaging to world stability and prosperity. On December 26, 2021, Chey Tae-won, Chairman of the Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Chairman of SK Group, loudly accused the United States of suppressing China in the high-tech field in the Korean media, claiming they were trying to bring a “new Cold War” to the global supply chain."
The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","Fourth, a “complete decoupling” from China’s economy and technology would be difficult to achieve. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic wreaking havoc around the world, it is not realistically practical to exclude China from the world supply chain system. According to statistics from the General Administration of Customs of China, in the first half of 2021, the total import and export value of China’s trade in goods was CNY 18.07 trillion, a year-on-year increase of 27.1%. Specifically, exports were CNY 9.85 trillion, an increase of 28.1%; and imports were CNY 8.22 trillion, an increase of 25.9%. Compared with the same period in 2019, combined imports and exports, exports, and imports increased by 22.8%, 23.8%, and 21.7% respectively. Specifically, imports and exports to China’s top three trading partners, ASEAN, the EU, and the United States were CNY 2.66 trillion, CNY 2.52 trillion, and CNY 2.21 trillion, an increase of 27.8%, 26.7%, and 34.6% respectively. Imports and exports to Japan were CNY 1.18 trillion, an increase of 14.5%. These data points show that third-party countries other than China and the United States have difficulty choosing between “values diplomacy” and economic reality. China is one of the few countries that has effectively controlled the domestic epidemic and restored production in an orderly manner. The majority of world countries will not truly “decouple” from China, the country most comprehensively and closely connected to the global production chain, supply chain, and value chain system, because of pressure and instigation by the United States."
The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","Fifth, the Chinese government has actively responded to the hostile practices of the Biden administration that risk bringing a “new Cold War” to Sino-U.S. relations. China not only emphasizes that they have the courage to fight and daring to fight, but also starts from the concept of building a “community with a shared future for mankind” and still strives to get the relationship between the two countries back on its normal track of cooperation and controllable relations. In addition to unilaterally spoiling for a fight, imposing restrictions, and creating obstructions, the China policy pursued by the Biden administration for nearly a year has actually been lackluster. On March 19, 2021, representatives of China and the United States held a high-level strategic dialogue in Anchorage, the first face-to-face meeting between high-level Chinese and U.S. diplomats since Biden took office. U.S. Secretary of State Blinken pointed out that the Sino-U.S. relationship will be “competitive when it should be, collaborative when it can be, and adversarial when it must be” to ensure a “rules-based international order.” In response, Chinese representative Yang Jiechi responded: “The vast majority of countries in the world do not recognize the universal values advocated by the United States, do not recognize the opinions of the United States as representative of international public opinion, and do not recognize the rules made by a few people as constituting the foundation of the international order,” and that the United States is also not qualified to “talk to China from a position of strength.” On July 26 of the same year, when Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Sherman in Tianjin, he proposed three bottom lines for how to effectively manage differences and prevent Sino-U.S. relations from spiraling out of control: (1) The United States shall not challenge, slander, or even attempt to subvert the path and system of socialism with Chinese characteristics; (2) The United States must not try to obstruct or even interrupt China’s development process; and (3) The United States must not violate China’s national sovereignty, much less compromise China’s territorial integrity. In addition, during the talks, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Xie Feng also put forward two lists: one was a list of errors for the United States to correct and the other was a list of key cases that China was concerned about. The United States, for its part, continues to attack China on human rights issues, cybersecurity issues, Taiwan issues, and South China Sea issues. However, in Biden’s first year in office, his bullying posture against China simply hit the wall in front of China."
The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","In the face of China’s resolute counterattack, the Biden administration had to draw back and adjust. During the Tianjin talks in July 2021, the U.S. representatives proposed to set up a “guardrail” in Sino-U.S. relations. On October 4 of the same year, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai delivered a speech at the U.S. Center for Strategic and International Studies, where she used the steel and photovoltaic industries as examples to prove the adverse impact of Chinese industrial policies on the development of related industries in other countries. She went on to point out that Chinese policy in the semiconductor industry will also be a “zero-sum game,” causing massive damage to market-based economies including the United States. This was used to justify the science and technology warfare launched by the United States. At the same time, she pointed out that the executive branch will adjust its trade policy with China. On the basis of evaluating the results of China’s implementation of Phase One of the Economic and Trade Agreement, they will launch targeted tariff exclusion processes and continue to pay attention to issues such as state-centered, non-market-oriented trade practices that did not appear in Phase One of the Economic and Trade Agreement. This is a veiled admission by the Biden administration that the comprehensive “decoupling” policy towards China is not only unrealistic, but also directly damages major interests of the United States. Katherine Tai’s proposal of Sino-U.S. economic “recoupling” not only shows the Biden administration’s helpless acquiescence to the reality that the total trade volume between China and the United States has risen sharply since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and that the “decoupling” of the U.S. and Chinese economies has failed, but also shows that the Biden administration’s economic and trade policies towards China cannot achieve a comprehensive and rapid economic “decoupling.”"

On September 10, 2021, the heads of state of China and the United States held a scheduled phone conversation for the purpose of strategic communication and exchange on Sino-U.S. relations and related issues between the two sides. Both sides agreed that in-depth communication between the leaders of China and the United States on Sino-U.S. relations and major international issues was very important in guiding the correct development of Sino-U.S. relations. They agreed to continue to maintain regular contact through various means and that they would instruct the working levels (工作层, the levels of government engaged in the practical work) of both sides to step up their work and conduct extensive dialogue so as to create conditions for the development of Sino-U.S. relations. On October 6, Yang Jiechi, Member of the Political Bureau of the CCP Central Committee and Director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CCP Central Committee, met with Jake Sullivan, Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, in Zurich, Switzerland. This was a new move by the two countries to implement the spirit of the call between the two heads of state on September 10 and make joint efforts to put Sino-U.S. relations back on the right track of healthy and stable development. On October 9, Liu He, member of the Political Bureau of the CCP Central Committee, Vice Premier of the State Council, and head Chinese representative for Sino-U.S. Comprehensive Economic Dialogue, held a video call with U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai, and the two sides had a pragmatic, candid, and constructive exchange. On November 16, the top leaders of China and the United States, Xi Jinping and Joe Biden, held a video meeting. Xi Jinping pointed out three principles that should be upheld in friendly relations between China and the United States: first, mutual respect, second, peaceful coexistence, and third, mutually beneficial cooperation. Biden emphasized the importance of responsibly managing competition and advocated for ensuring that the relationship between the two countries does not devolve into conflict and for ensuring unimpeded exchanges. The two sides conducted a full and in-depth conversation and exchange on strategic, overall, and fundamental issues related to the development of Sino-U.S. relations as well as important issues of mutual concern. The Sino-U.S. dialogue during the one-year-old Biden presidency shows that there is still hope for exploring and working towards the establishment of a rational, controllable, and fair competition model for the relationship between the two countries."

The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","The “Four-Pronged Approach” of strategic suppression of China by the Biden administration is not only determined by the strategic culture for maintaining U.S. hegemony and the belief in the superiority of U.S.-style democracy. Even more, it is determined by the current political and social divisions and oppositions in the United States as well as the “internal turmoil” caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, and racism. The more turbulent and tarnished the U.S. internal situation becomes, the greater the urgency in U.S. political and strategic circles to suppress China and prevent China from catching up to the United States. The “strategic competition with China” announced by the Biden administration is, in fact, a strategic offensive launched by the United States in an attempt to maintain its hegemonic superiority and reopen the gap in power between China and itself. Sino-U.S. relations are still far from entering a “strategic stalemate.”"
The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","Although the Biden administration’s China policy has been adjusted and they have proposed suggestions such as Sino-U.S. economic “recoupling” and expanding and continuing dialogue channels between the two countries, the Biden administration’s “Four-Pronged Approach” and attempts to suppress China will be part of the policy of strategic competition with China for the long term. We must have no illusions about this. Of course, the relationship between China and the United States, as the relationship between the world’s largest economy and the second-largest economy, does not have the nature of a “zero-sum game.” The common hope of the international community is that China and the United States will manage and control their competition through dialogue and achieve a relationship of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, and win-win cooperation. The long-term stability of Sino-U.S. relations requires the Biden administration to substantively adjust the comprehensive policy of suppressing and containing China in the economic and security fields across multiple dimensions. Recent adjustments of Biden’s policies focus more on effectively allocating domestic resources, alleviating high inflation, and integrating alliances. In key high-tech fields, they are attempting to form a situation of comprehensive containment against China, prevent China’s industrial upgrade, and confine China to the middle and low end of the global value chain so as to achieve the comprehensive suppression of China’s economic development and military technology over a longer term. Such U.S. policy toward China will be continued over the long term. The challenge that the Biden administration poses to China in the high-tech field is bound to be more threatening and long-term, and the competition between the great powers will be sharp and complex. This requires and pushes China to strengthen its determination, vision, and capabilities in order to deal with challenges as never before."
The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","First, China must strengthen the construction of its domestic legislative system and promote the process of rule of law construction for national security in the fields of commerce and trade. Since Biden took power, he has worked hard to create “coordination of the government and society” measures to restrict China’s economic, trade, science and technology, and cultural exchanges. China also needs to promote relevant national capacity building in this field. The adoption of the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law of the People’s Republic of China at the 29th Session of the Standing Committee of the 13th National People’s Congress on June 10, 2021 provides a vivid example. The strategic competition between China and the United States will continue for a long time. Building a complete legal system is not only necessary to counter U.S. sanctions and safeguard national interests. Even more so, it also addresses the long-term strategic competition between China and the United States and the need to improve China’s own domestic governance capabilities."
The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","In addition, China must optimize industrial policies and enhance innovation capabilities to deal with technological blockades. The infrastructure bill and innovation bill have been the focus of efforts to revive domestic economic competitiveness under Biden’s presidency. The implementation of innovation in the high-tech industry must be undertaken with a complete supply chain network and also relies on developed infrastructure to provide channels for sales to the world. In contrast, China’s rapid development in the field of infrastructure construction has laid a solid material foundation for future strategic competition with the United States, and industrial policy, as an important means of China’s economic rise, should also play a more active role in the era of great-power competition: China must devote more resources in the field of science and technology to support key industries such as 5G, chips, new energy, and electric vehicles, to form international comparative advantages, to build a complete production chain, and to achieve technological independence and control; while creating new growth points for economic development, China must strengthen international cooperation in the field of science and technology, promote the sustainable and healthy development of the high-tech industry, optimize and transform the domestic economic structure, and improve the quality and efficiency of economic development; using new infrastructure construction and dual circulation as opportunities, China must compensate for industry shortcomings and accelerate industrial agglomeration and production chain integration in order to better safeguard national economic security."
The State and Dilemmas of the Biden Administration’s Strategic Competition with China,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Ni Guihua , Zhu Feng","Jan 26, 2022","Furthermore, China must further deepen reform and opening up and prepare for a “Second WTO Accession” so as to connect the commerce, society, and personnel of China and the world in a closer, more pragmatically, and more efficient manner. China officially completed the approval process for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) on April 15, 2021 and formally submitted its application to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) on September 16. This is the only way to deal with the “extreme competition” of the United States given the new situation—promote development through reform and seize opportunities through opening up: China must optimize its business environment, promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, and enhance China’s attractiveness to overseas capital in order to form stronger economic ties; China must strengthen cooperation in the field of climate with countries along the “Belt and Road” and among China, the United States, and Europe, strengthen international cooperation in clean technology, green energy, green finance, and carbon neutrality and carbon peaking across the global production chain, and strive to achieve strategic mutual trust with the United States on climate issues in order to build a global green economic governance system. By promoting regional economic integration and negotiating and signing free trade arrangements and other flexible means, strengthening economic and trade ties with various economies, making every effort to increase the costs of the forcible “decoupling” between the United States and China, China can resist the tide of de-globalization with a more active and open posture."
The Taiwan Strait Game Between China and the United States: Risk Variables and Crisis Management,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Cao Qun","May 13, 2022","With the China-U.S. strategic game intensifying, the United States is frequently playing the “Taiwan card” in a vain attempt to use the Taiwan issue as a “counterweight” to pressure China and force China to “make concessions” on other issues. In recent years, the Tsai Ing-wen administration has insisted on taking the path of “gradual Taiwan independence” and being “pro-United States and anti-mainland China.” The United States, meanwhile, has adopted a “supportive” or “facilitating” attitude in many areas such as mutual visits with Taiwan officials, legislation, and military affairs, raising the official level of U.S.-Taiwan interaction, increasing arms sales to Taiwan, and passing several Taiwan-related bills that openly defy China’s bottom line. Although the Biden administration has made some adjustments in its Taiwan Strait policy compared to its predecessor, it has not changed the strategic thinking of “using Taiwan to control China,” and appears to be “more structured” and “shrewd and calculating” in its implementation. “This trend is very dangerous. It is playing with fire, and those who play with fire will set themselves on fire.”1"

It has also cooperated with the Tsai Ing-wen administration to continuously hype so-called “incursions” into the “Taiwan Air Defense Identification Zone” by PLA military aircraft, which is a false proposition completely inconsistent with basic facts and elementary international law, and contrary to the consistent position of the United States. Under the pretext of “opposing unilateral changes to the status quo or undermining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,” it intervenes in Taiwan Strait affairs and finds “reasonableness” to support provocations such as sending more U.S. warships and aircraft to conduct high-frequency activities in the region. The collusion of all kinds between the United States and Taiwan has caused grave damage to U.S.-China relations. The Taiwan issue is the most important and sensitive core issue between the United States and China, and if not handled properly, it will cause subversive and comprehensive damage to China-U.S. relations. The next moves and potential tactics of U.S.-Taiwan collusion, as well as its impact on the direction of the U.S.-China Taiwan Strait game, deserve close attention, and it is especially important to analyze how to stop its “spillover” from negatively affecting our national security and overall diplomatic situation."

Compared to the Trump administration’s “blustering” approach, the Biden administration has made some adjustments in tactics, but it has failed to fundamentally change the strategic thinking of “using Taiwan to control China.” Its “salami-slicing” ploys on Taiwan-related issues have increased in strength and frequency, its manner of playing the “Taiwan card” has become more “underhanded” and “scheming,” and the threat that its initiatives pose to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait continues to rise. In recent years, the “two-faced nature” of the Biden administration’s policy toward China has become increasingly apparent. As State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at a press conference for the “Two Sessions” in March 2022, “U.S. leaders and some senior officials have said that the United States does not seek a new Cold War, does not seek to change China’s institutions, does not seek to strengthen alliances against China, does not support ‘Taiwan independence,’ and has no intention of engaging in conflict or confrontation with China.

The Taiwan Strait Game Between China and the United States: Risk Variables and Crisis Management,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Cao Qun","May 13, 2022","As the United States pushes forward with comprehensive strategic competition with China, “deterrence” against China in the Taiwan Strait is an important tactic. The Biden administration has continued the Trump administration’s practice of mentioning Taiwan in its National Security Strategy. Its Interim National Security Strategy Guidance released in March 2021 states that, in accordance with its long-term commitments, it will support Taiwan as a “democracy, a key economy, and a security partner.”3 In February 2022, the Biden administration released the Indo-Pacific Strategy document, which in regard to Taiwan-related issues explicitly indicates: “We (the United States) will also work with partners in the region and beyond to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, including supporting Taiwan’s self-defense capabilities, to ensure an environment in which the future of Taiwan is peacefully determined by the will and best interests of its people. As we do so, our approach remains consistent with our one-China policy and the longstanding commitments we have made under the ‘Taiwan Relations Act,’ the three Joint Communiqués, and the Six Assurances.” 4 Even after the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out in Europe, Russia’s priority as a strategic competitor to the United States did not rise. In March 2022, the U.S. Department of Defense submitted a classified version of the National Defense Strategy to Congress. In its published “Fact Sheet,” the United States still considers China “the most important strategic competitor” and “will prioritize the Chinese challenge in the Indo-Pacific.” It is likely that the undisclosed portion of the document contains Taiwan-related content similar to that of the Indo-Pacific Strategy.5"

When Secretary of State nominee Antony Blinken addressed the Taiwan issue at a U.S. Senate hearing on January 19, 2021, he professed his support for the Trump-era approach of lifting restrictions on U.S.-Taiwan relations. 6 The State Department under Blinken’s leadership later issued a statement on January 23 groundlessly accusing China of “military pressure against Taiwan” that “threatens regional peace and stability,” emphasizing the U.S. commitment to Taiwan in response to the alleged repeated penetration of PLA military aircraft into the “Taiwan Air Defense Identification Zone,” stressing that the U.S. commitment to Taiwan is “rock-solid” and that it will honor its commitments under the three U.S.-China Joint Communiqués, the “Taiwan Relations Act” and the Six Assurances to Taiwan, and continue to assist Taiwan in maintaining adequate self-defense capabilities. 7  In a media interview in April, Blinken alleged that China was raising tensions in the Taiwan Strait, and stressed that the United States had what he called a “serious commitment” to maintaining Taiwan’s self-defense capabilities, adding that “anyone who tries to use force to change the status quo will be making a serious mistake.” 8 In a speech at the IISS-Fullerton Lecture in July, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin peddled the “Indo-Pacific Strategy.” Talking about the Taiwan issue, he said that U.S. collaboration with Taiwan to enhance its self-defense capabilities is consistent with the United States’ one-China policy. 9 The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan shook public opinion in Taiwan, but Jake Sullivan, President Biden’s National Security Advisor, emphasized that “the U.S. commitment to Taiwan is as strong as it’s ever been,” and said “Afghanistan is different from Taiwan.” 10 In a statement issued in early October in response to the so-called record “incursions” by PLA military aircraft into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone, the U.S. Department of State, in addition to repeating the January statement, “urged Beijing to cease its military, diplomatic, and economic pressure and coercion on Taiwan,” and also expressed its high level of concern over “provocative military actions” by mainland China around Taiwan. 11"

In February 2021, U.S. Secretary of State Blinken held talks in Honolulu with Japanese Foreign Minister Hayashi Yoshimasa and South Korean Foreign Minister Chung Eui-yong. They issued a joint statement after the meeting “emphasizing the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.” 21 It was the first time the words “Taiwan Strait” had appeared in a joint statement by the foreign ministers of the United States, Japan and South Korea. In April, Biden met with visiting Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga. The post-meeting U.S.-Japan Leaders’ Statement, in addition to reiterating opposition to “any unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the East China Sea” and “China’s unlawful maritime claims and activities in the South China Sea,” also mentioned the Taiwan issue. (This was the first time since the Nixon-Sato summit meeting in 1969 that content on Taiwan was included in a U.S.-Japan leader’s statement) “[We] underscore the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and encourage the peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues.”22 From the Japanese side’s subsequent performance, it is clear that it has “common self-interest” with the United States in “using Taiwan to control China.” As a result, from a security and strategic point of view, Japan has been constantly sending policy signals that it will continue to intervene militarily and intervene in the trend of the situation, alone or by “teaming up” with the United States.23 In May, the G7 foreign ministers’ meeting was held in London, and the joint communiqué issued after the meeting contained a good deal of Taiwan-related content. In addition to declaring support for Taiwan authorities to participate in the WHO and the World Health Assembly, it also went out of its way to “link two seas with the Taiwan Strait” by inserting the issue of Taiwan Strait security into the “East China Sea and South China Sea”—stressing the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and calling for a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan Strait issue, all while focusing on the situation in the East China Sea and the South China Sea. 24 In June, at the urging of the United States and Japan, the joint communiqué of the G-7 summit publicly mentioned the Taiwan Strait issue for the first time in (with wording similar to that of the foreign ministers’ meeting in May).25 In September, the United States, the UK, and Australia announced the establishment of a trilateral security partnership, and included the Taiwan issue in a so-called “Indo-Pacific Strategy.” The United States and Australia’s remarks on Taiwan once again exposed their long-standing misunderstandings on the Taiwan issue and their attempt to “use Taiwan to control China.”26 In December, the United States and the European Union held their second “U.S.-EU Dialogue on China” in Washington, D.C. The joint statement issued after the meeting expressed strong concern about China’s “problematic unilateral actions” in the South China Sea, East China Sea, and Taiwan Strait, which they said “undermine peace and security in the region and have a direct impact on the security and prosperity of both the United States and European Union.”27"

The main provisions include: Reaffirms that the “Taiwan Relations Act” and the Six Assurances are the foundation of U.S. policy toward Taiwan; increases U.S.-Taiwan military exchanges, and plans to invite Taiwan to participate in the 2022 Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC); emphasizes that the U.S. government should have the ability to prevent mainland China from using force to “invade and seize control of Taiwan before the United States can respond effectively;” calls for exploring ways to strengthen cooperation between U.S. and Taiwan intelligence services, wherein U.S. intelligence agencies could use technical and material assistance to help Taiwan to counter “influence operations;” says the U.S. Department of Defense needs to develop programs to help Taiwan improve its “asymmetric warfare capabilities;” and promotes cooperation between the U.S. National Guard and Taiwan, including disaster preparedness and response, cybersecurity and communications security, medical cooperation, Mandarin Chinese training and cultural exchanges, and providing National Guard advisors to help train Taiwan’s reserve forces, with cooperation methods to include personnel exchange visits and joint exercises and training. 40 In March 2022, as the situation in Ukraine was intensifying,  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy, Plans and Capabilities Mara Karlin hyped the “Ukraine model,” and recommended that the Taiwan authorities build “asymmetrical combat power” so that the people of Taiwan would be prepared to make reunification by force as “prickly” as possible. 41"

During the Trump period, the U.S. Congress focused Taiwan-related legislation on lifting restrictions on official U.S.-Taiwan exchanges, upgrading arms sales to Taiwan and U.S.-Taiwan military security relations, and supporting Taiwan’s expanded foreign engagement, passing the “Taiwan Travel Act” (2018), the “Asia Reassurance Initiative Act” (2018), the “Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative (TAIPEI) Act” (2019), and the “Taiwan Assurance Act” (2020).42 Since the beginning of the Biden administration, the number of Taiwan-related proposals in the U.S. Congress has increased significantly, with 34 related proposals in the first session of the 117th Congress alone, nearly three times as many as in the 115th Congress. 43 However, it is rarer for Taiwan-related proposals to be passed into law under Biden compared to under Trump, and as of April 2022, the only ones that appear to have been included in the FY2022 Omnibus Appropriations Act are provisions related to “prohibiting the mislabeling” of Taiwan maps, 44 and the only bill passed by both chambers and expected to be signed by President Biden is one on Taiwan’s participation in the WHO (which bill requires the U.S. Department of State to include in its annual report a discussion of the challenges and improvements to its program to support Taiwan’s observer status in the WHO). 45 In addition, the Senate-passed U.S. Innovation and Competition Act (2021) and the House-passed America COMPETES Act (2021) contain essentially the same set of uncontroversial provisions to strengthen U.S.-Taiwan cooperation to “resist” mainland China, and are also more likely to be passed by both chambers and become laws."

What requires particular attention is the set of negative factors reflected in the recent “public opinion war” involving Taiwan, and the “spillover” risk variables of U.S.-Taiwan collusion in all out “cognitive warfare.” In the short term, especially after the situation in Ukraine enters a stalemate period, the “spillover” risk variables of “cognitive warfare” in the Taiwan Strait may increase dramatically, and the potential harm to China’s diplomatic situation and economic and trade cooperation with the United States and Western countries may be greater."

Tsai Ing-wen claimed to be “determined to safeguard Taiwan’s security,” while Lai Ching-te hyped the “mainland threat theory” and advocated uniting and cooperating to safeguard Taiwan’s so-called “sovereignty.” 48"
The Taiwan Strait Game Between China and the United States: Risk Variables and Crisis Management,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Cao Qun","May 13, 2022","In recent years, especially from 2017 to 2019, the Taiwan authorities have continued to suffer from a “diplomatic crisis” and a shrinking “international space.” Many of its former “diplomatic allies” have severed “diplomatic relations” with it, and its “representative offices” in countries other than its “diplomatic allies” have been renamed one after another. 49 Unable to accept this normal picture of the one-China principle becoming the overwhelming consensus in the international community, Tsai Ing-wen’s administration has sought opportunities to “counterattack” in some “small countries.” It finally found a “breakthrough point” in Lithuania in 2021 by establishing a “Representative Office in Lithuania” under the name of “Taiwan”—the only existing example among countries that are not Taiwan’s “diplomatic allies.” Given that the “Taiwan independence” forces do not have confidence in their military power and that it is not in the interest of the United States to “change the status quo,” the main focus of the Tsai Ing-wen administration’s “independence-seeking” efforts may still be on “diplomacy.” As the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine unfolds, the Taiwan authorities may “take advantage of the opportunity” to expand the “one China, one Taiwan international space” in Europe. The next step in its “relying on foreign powers to seek independence” may be to strengthen relations with European countries that are not its “diplomatic allies” and to promote the establishment of more “representative offices” under the name of “Taiwan.” In recent years, a number of European parliamentary delegations have visited Taiwan (including a delegation from the European Parliament). The “Taiwan-friendly” forces in some European countries are developing relatively fast, especially in some Eastern European countries, and the Taiwan authorities will continue to vigorously push these countries to follow Lithuania’s suit in establishing “Taiwan representative offices.”"

The Taiwan Strait Game Between China and the United States: Risk Variables and Crisis Management,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Cao Qun","May 13, 2022","In the short term, the United States will probably continue promoting the “internationalization” of the Taiwan Strait issue, engaging in “public opinion building” to guide the “spillover” of its connection with the Ukraine issue, and smearing and attacking the normal activities of the PLA in the airspace in and around the Taiwan Strait, in order to form a “moral deterrent” against China internationally. After the situation in Ukraine stabilizes, the United States will most likely strengthen its Taiwan-related collusion with relevant European countries, for example, by using the opportunity of solidarity with Lithuania against “Chinese coercion” to hype issues such as the right to interpret the one-China policy and the definition of “one China, one Taiwan.” It may even actively cooperate with the Taiwan authorities to encourage more European countries that are at odds with Russia to set up “representative offices” under the name of “Taiwan.” At the same time, it will continue to hype issues related to Xinjiang, Hong Kong, the South China Sea, and the East China Sea, thus causing alienation in China-Europe relations and interfering with the normal development of China-Europe economic and trade cooperation, in order to serve its overall strategic competition with China, and achieve its goals of strengthening its control over Europe, uniting its Western allies to “isolate China,” “making a fresh start” at “reconstructing international economic and trade rules,” containing China’s peaceful rise, and preventing China from challenging U.S. global hegemony."
The Taiwan Strait Game Between China and the United States: Risk Variables and Crisis Management,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Cao Qun","May 13, 2022","First, the United States may step up propaganda efforts on the “true meaning” of its one-China policy in a vain attempt to confuse public opinion in the international community and rope in more “unsuspecting” countries to join its “Taiwan’s undefined status” club that hollows out the one-China principle. According to Richard C. Bush, a leading U.S. expert on the Taiwan Strait, the United States’ one-China policy is a very vague and complex amalgamation that can be interpreted by the United States in various flexible ways. In Bush’s view, there are subtle differences between the three U.S.-China Joint Communiqués, and since the establishment of U.S.-China diplomatic relations, the United States has maintained a “Taiwan status is undetermined” interpretation that benefits itself and preserves sufficient ambiguity in the United States’ one-China policy. 50 We must maintain a clear recognition that the current U.S. administration hardly agrees with the one-China principle, and its interpretation of the one-China policy is increasingly biased toward promoting potential differences with China’s position. If the U.S. side continues “salami slicing” the one-China principle—the political foundation and most important cornerstone of U.S.-China relations—it will eventually “hollow it out” completely or “slice its own hand” through carelessness, and the mutual trust between the United States and China will be seriously damaged or even “hollowed out.” The risks in interaction between China and the United States in the Taiwan Strait will then increase significantly. Secondly, on the Taiwan Strait issue, the United States seems to have adopted a tactic similar to that in the South China Sea game with China, hiding its selfish intention of colluding with the Taiwan authorities to “use Taiwan to control China,” engaging in a campaign of “public opinion preparation” (hyping the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait and China’s “military pressure” on Taiwan), and searching for “rational” excuses for the deepening of U.S.-Taiwan security cooperation and the exchange of high-level visits between the United States and Taiwan. In the future, the U.S. government may use “public opinion preparation” to widely publicize the differences between the U.S. one-China policy and China’s position, as a means of strengthening collusion with allies on Taiwan and creating an “international consensus” and “international momentum,” thereby “internationalizing” the Taiwan Strait issue, and thus alienating China from Europe and “isolating China,” driving a wedge in China-EU economic and trade cooperation in particular (including supporting the EU in initiating “arbitration” against China in the WTO over the trade and economic issues between China and Lithuania), blocking China’s promotion of “Belt and Road” initiative cooperation, and even promoting China’s disconnection from the global supply chain and production chain, so as to achieve its goal of “making a fresh start” at reconstructing international economic and trade rules."
The Taiwan Strait Game Between China and the United States: Risk Variables and Crisis Management,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Cao Qun","May 13, 2022","After the situation in Ukraine enters a stable period, the United States and the West may take the opportunity to strengthen Taiwan-related collusion, especially by drawing parallels between the Ukraine issue and China’s “sanctioning” of Lithuania, and increasing “expressions of solidarity” and economic support for Lithuania. They may then promote the formation of a “multinational consensus” on the fine points of “one-China policy” interpretation, stressing that Lithuania allowing the Taiwan authorities to set up a “Taiwan Representative Office” does not mean supporting “two Chinas” or “one China, one Taiwan.” When the time is ripe, they can join hands with the Taiwan authorities to encourage more European countries to set up “Taiwan Representative Offices.” The United States will probably let European “small countries” charge ahead, while the United States hides behind to “offer advice” and provide “intellectual” support and diplomatic resources to cooperate in fighting “public opinion battles” (such as the United States support for the Philippines’ “South China Sea arbitration case”). This way, the United States can “reap” the spoils of its campaign to contain China while staying “off the field,” and can also “retreat” at any time."
The Taiwan Strait Game Between China and the United States: Risk Variables and Crisis Management,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Cao Qun","May 13, 2022","Finally, the United States and Western countries may support greater “intellectual collusion” on Taiwan-related issues, with the aim of finding “rationality” for their Taiwan Strait narratives through “academic research.” In recent years, in order to hype mainland China’s “military pressure” on Taiwan, many experts in the United States and the West have not scrupled to violate their long-held views on “freedom of navigation,” using a double standard to accuse PLA military aircraft of “intruding” into “Taiwan’s air defense identification zone” and endangering the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait. In the future, U.S. and Western think tanks are likely to release more research reports on Taiwan-related issues, especially to “challenge” China’s position with regard to the detailed issues of the legal implications of “one China.” For example, the recent study by Drun and Glaser for the German Marshall Fund, which improperly alleges “distortion of UN Resolution 2758” by Beijing, has had a very bad impact. 51"

The U.S. side seems to believe that it has the right to undermine the status quo in cross-Strait relations at all levels, and to cheer on “Taiwan independence” elements. U.S. military ships and aircraft enjoy “freedom of navigation and overflight” in the Taiwan Strait, while the PLA’s actions in going “out to sea” are “provocations and threats.” For the U.S. side to use this sort of “American arrogance” thinking and harbor illusions about restricting the PLA’s going “out to sea” is divorced from reality. The U.S. side needs to face the fact that the main factor threatening peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is its policy of “using Taiwan to control China,” whereas regular combat readiness patrols of the airspace around the Taiwan Strait by PLA military aircraft are a necessary measure to counter U.S.-Taiwan collusion. Under this kind of “status quo,” the intensive operations of U.S. and Chinese military aircraft in the airspace around the Taiwan Strait may indeed lead to “accidents.” To avoid triggering further deterioration in the Taiwan Strait situation, the Taiwan authorities and the U.S. and Western media should stop hyping the so-called “incursions” by PLA military aircraft into the “Taiwan Air Defense Identification Zone” and restore the truth. 52 The U.S. side should cease taking a “double-standard” on the PLA’s normal activities in the Taiwan Strait, strictly control its military actions around the Taiwan Strait, and avoid provocations that “cross the line” and endanger peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait, otherwise the consequences would be unthinkable."

It is unrealistic to expect a hypothetical “median line” to restrict the PLA’s space for activities, and the U.S. side must have a correct understanding of this. This hypothetical “median line” may have been drawn by the United States in the early 1950s to restrict the Taiwanese authorities’ “counterattack on the mainland” when the PLA’s navy and air force were weak and Kuomintang (Nationalist) warplanes repeatedly conducted reconnaissance, air combat, and even bombing missions in the coastal areas of the mainland west of the “median line.” 53 The U.S. and Taiwan authorities seem to have forgotten this history, and now regard PLA military aircraft exercises in the airspace east of the “median line” as “changing the status quo” or “harmful and unhelpful to regional stability.” This completely turns the facts on their heads. Even if we follow the logic of “traditional freedom of the high seas” that the U.S. side has always claimed, the PLA’s military aircraft exercises in the Taiwan Strait conform to international law, so the U.S. side’s accusations lack justification. In recent years, PLA exercises and training activities in the airspace east of the “median line of the Taiwan Strait” or in the “airspace southwest of Taiwan” have been conducted in “international airspace,” and thus fall under “internationally lawful use” to which the U.S. side claims military aircraft are entitled under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. From the U.S. side’s words and actions related to the so-called “provocative military actions” of mainland China, it seems that it believes only the ships and aircraft of the United States and its “allies” enjoy “freedom of navigation and overflight” and can conduct “peaceful” military activities such as close reconnaissance in “international waters and airspace” adjacent to China’s territorial waters and airspace, while the naval and air force ships and aircraft of China, which is a party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (which the United States has yet to ratify), are “military threats” once they are “out to sea.” 54 Such “double standard” arguments from the U.S. side are unlikely to deceive knowledgeable members of the international community, and the PLA will not stop its normal and legitimate activities in the Taiwan Strait just because of its unfounded accusations."

The Taiwan Strait Game Between China and the United States: Risk Variables and Crisis Management,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Cao Qun","May 13, 2022","Since the start of the Biden administration, “hawkish” forces in the United States have been trying to gain the advantage in the “comprehensive strategic competition” with China by “using Taiwan to control China.” There are even comments in the foreign press that the United States is suspected of using the Taiwan Strait issue to goad China into “firing the first shot,” so that it can take the opportunity to unite with its allies and “team up” against China. 55 This view has gained many “fans” since the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis. U.S. actions have made it difficult to reconcile the contradictions between China and the United States on the Taiwan Strait issue, mainly due to the United States’ insistence on pursuing the “use Taiwan to control China” policy. The United States has increasingly hollowed out the one-China policy in recent years, and it has colluded with the Taiwan authorities to promote the “undetermined status of Taiwan” theory, which seriously threatens peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and makes it particularly urgent to strengthen mechanisms for managing crises between China and the United States. In April 2022, State Councilor and Defense Minister Wei Fenghe emphasized during a call with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin (the first call between a U.S. and Chinese defense secretaries since the Biden administration took office) that the U.S. side must put its “four ‘does not’ and one ‘has no intention'” 56 commitment into practice, that the Chinese military will resolutely safeguard national sovereignty, security, and territorial integrity, and that Taiwan is an integral part of China. These are the facts and the status quo, which no one can change. 57 Foreign media disclosed that Austin, in addition to focusing on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, also expressed to Wei Fenghe the United States’ concerns about China’s so-called military provocations in the Taiwan Strait and activities in the South China and East China Seas, and reiterated Biden’s remarks about the importance of improving crisis communication between the two countries and managing U.S.-China strategic competition, including in the nuclear, space, and cyber domains. 58 Judging from the relevant content discussed in the call between the U.S. and Chinese defense secretaries, crisis management is by far the biggest point of convergence between the two sides. (“Both sides agreed that the U.S. and Chinese militaries should keep communication channels open, manage risks, and promote the construction of a crisis communication mechanism. 59“)"
The Taiwan Strait Game Between China and the United States: Risk Variables and Crisis Management,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Cao Qun","May 13, 2022","On the Taiwan Strait issue, China and the United States need to further negotiate more practical and in-depth cooperation on confidence-building measures and crisis management at the strategic and technical levels, based on the two countries’ current crisis management mechanisms. The existing crisis management mechanisms of China and the United States mainly have three types of institutional arrangements: high-level interaction, dialogue and communication channels, and military rules of behavior. The first two types of “strategic dialogue”-based mechanisms include Defense Consultative Talks (DCT),60 Joint Strategic Dialogue Mechanism (JSDM), 61 Defense Policy Coordination Talk (PCT), 62 the U.S.-China Military Maritime Consultative Agreement (MMCA), 63 and the Defense Telephone Link (DTL), 64 as well as the suspended Strategic Security Dialogue, the Asia-Pacific Security Dialogue (APSD) between defense departments, and the Diplomatic and Security Dialogue (two-plus-two). 65 The third category of rules of behavior-based mechanisms at the “technical” level includes the Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES), 66 adopted at the 14th Western Pacific Naval Symposium (WPNS) in 2014, 67 and the “Notification of Major Military Activities [and] Confidence Building Measures Mechanism” and the “Rules of Behavior for Safety of Air and Maritime Encounters,”68 established in November 2014. (In September 2015, the two sides completed the formal signing of a “Military Crisis Notification” annex to the “Notification of Major Military Activities” mechanism and an “Air Encounters” annex to the “Rules of Behavior for Safety of Air and Maritime Encounters.”) 69 It is worth noting that rules of behavior-based mechanisms at the “technical” level (e.g., the most specific of the institutional arrangements between the U.S. and Chinese militaries—the “Notification of Major Military Activities and Confidence Building Measures Mechanism” and the “Rules of Behavior for Safety of Air and Maritime Encounters”) are often influenced by the political climate and overall relationship environment, and do not always play a significant role in curbing maritime conflicts between the two sides. 70 Therefore, to further strengthen U.S.-China crisis management mechanisms for the Taiwan Strait, joint promotion is necessary at both the “strategic” and “technical” levels. It is especially necessary to negotiate on crisis prevention and confidence-building measures in the Taiwan Strait at the “strategic” level, to prevent the “strategic mutual trust deficit” from rendering ineffective the existing “rules of behavior” between the two militaries. In addition, the only way to control the risk variables arising from the U.S. policy of “using Taiwan to control China” so that they do not “spill over” to other aspects of U.S.-China relations is to rely on “strategic dialogue.” Under the current circumstances, if the U.S. side does not “dial back” its Taiwan Strait policy, the gap between the positions of the United States and China will be huge, and cause concern for the practical significance of strengthening the “strategic dialogue” between the United States and China to prevent crises in the Taiwan Strait."

However, they all have “technical shortcomings” in terms of obligatoriness and operability, and there are potential differences in the interpretation of international law between the two sides. Therefore, in order for the United States and China to avoid misjudgment and escalation of “accidents” in the increasingly “crowded” Taiwan Strait region, it is necessary for the two sides to hold in-depth consultations on the basis of existing mechanisms, strive to negotiate more detailed rules, and in particular avoid dangerous and provocative actions against each other."

The United States often talks about “freedom of navigation” to conceal its intention to deploy military forces, but its real claim is “freedom of military activity.” Issues such as “excessive straight baselines,” “innocent passage” of foreign warships in territorial waters, and freedom of military activity in exclusive economic zones all stem from this. On the first two issues, the differences between the U.S. and Chinese positions are very clear and difficult to reconcile in the short term. On the issue of freedom of military activity in exclusive economic zones, there is still room for “policy” coordination between the United States and China on specific practices."
The Taiwan Strait Game Between China and the United States: Risk Variables and Crisis Management,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Cao Qun","May 13, 2022","It is worth noting that the United States often conflates the issue of “freedom of military activity in exclusive economic zones” with the issue of “freedom of navigation,” but strictly speaking the two are not the same thing at all. Article 58 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea states: “In the exclusive economic zone, all States, whether coastal or land-locked, enjoy, subject to the relevant provisions of this Convention, the freedoms referred to in article 87 of navigation and overflight and of the laying of submarine cables and pipelines, and other internationally lawful uses of the sea related to these freedoms, such as those associated with the operation of ships, aircraft and submarine cables and pipelines, and compatible with the other provisions of this Convention.”73 The United States is in fact ascribing “freedom of military activity within exclusive economic zones” to the aforementioned “other internationally lawful uses,” but “other internationally lawful uses” cannot be equated with “freedom of navigation.” Rather, they are uses of the seas related to “freedom of navigation.” The U.S. side should reflect on whether it is reasonable to differentiate “rules camps” according to its own interpretation of relevant international law, such as by including China among the 27 countries with which it disagrees on the issue of freedom of military activity in exclusive economic zones, 74 but the “reasonableness” argument offered by the U.S. side is very limited. The U.S. “Freedom of Navigation Operations” reports in recent years have often referred to the “excessive maritime claims” in the Survey and Mapping Law of the People’s Republic of China. If the U.S. side believed that a distinction should be made between military surveying and marine scientific research, and that the United States and China had divergent legal claims on this issue, then it would have been entirely possible for the U.S. side to have consulted with the Chinese side in a “more peaceful” manner to “convince people with reason” rather than just relying on military ships and aircraft to “apply pressure.”"
The Taiwan Strait Game Between China and the United States: Risk Variables and Crisis Management,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Cao Qun","May 13, 2022","The U.S.-China “Rules of Behavior for Safety of Air and Maritime Encounters” expressly states that the “Rules” are without prejudice to the respective “policies” of the two sides regarding military activities in exclusive economic zones. 75 Some scholars have pointed out that China’s opposition to U.S. close reconnaissance and other military operations in its exclusive economic zone (EEZ) is primarily due to security concerns rather than legal reasons, and that China’s recognition and practice regarding its EEZ is becoming more open as the Chinese military’s overseas activities continue to grow. 76 However, the Taiwan Strait is an exceptionally sensitive area, and the U.S. side should have a clear understanding of this. Within the potential EEZ of the Taiwan Strait, high-profile “passage” by U.S. ships and aircraft is provocative. (China has not accused them of violating international law in any of its statements.) For the “Taiwan independence” forces, moreover, they are a kind of “support and cheering.” They are purely provocative moves that promote the “militarization” of the Taiwan Strait. The U.S. side needs to reduce the frequency and intensity of its military activities in the Taiwan Strait, and not vainly try to intimidate and pressure China in this way. It should abide by the one-China principle and do more things that benefit China-U.S. relations and promote peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, instead of doing the opposite."
The Taiwan Strait Game Between China and the United States: Risk Variables and Crisis Management,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Cao Qun","May 13, 2022","Finally, it appears that the two sides should explore filling the “gaps” in the existing mechanisms as to rules that may be able to coordinate their practices, such as on how to coordinate their positions and practices in the case of “intentional encounters” in military exercise areas. The Chinese side had already announced the latitude and longitude boundaries of an exercise area in late August 2020, but a U.S. U-2 reconnaissance aircraft nonetheless intruded. 77 If such a situation were to occur in the Taiwan Strait, it could have unforeseen and serious repercussions. The difficulty of applying the “Rules of Behavior for Safety of Air and Maritime Encounters” and other mechanisms to such situations is mainly due to the apparently divergent practices of China and the United States. As stipulated in Section 5, Paragraph 1 of Annex III (“Rules of Behavior for Safety of Air-to-Air Encounters”) to the Memorandum of Understanding on the Rules of Behavior for Safety of Air and Maritime Encounters (“When conducting activities that will affect the safety of nearby military vessels and military aircraft, commanders are to ensure the appropriate danger zone or warning zone is established or declared”) and Paragraph 3 of the same Section (“The military vessels and military aircraft of one Side should refrain from impeding the relevant activities in the applicable zones established or declared by the other Side; however, military vessels and military aircraft always enjoy the rights of freedom of navigation, overflight, and other internationally lawful uses of the sea related to these freedoms”) 78, the U.S. side may argue that its reconnaissance aircraft do not interfere with China’s exercise activities, and so do not violate the provisions of these paragraphs, or that its military aircraft have always enjoyed “other internationally lawful uses of the sea” and are not obligated to comply in “international airspace” with exercise area restrictions established by other countries. According to the U.S. position, for an exercise area established by a country outside its airspace, other countries’ ships and aircraft are not required to stay away and have “freedom of navigation” to enter the area to conduct intelligence gathering activities, as long as they have “due regard” for the relevant rights of the country that established the area.79"

Given the high sensitivity and special nature of the Taiwan Strait region, China and the United States must consider establishing more targeted “strict” rules, and discuss how to avoid problems such as friction in the event of “intentional encounters” between military aircraft of both sides or multiple parties.

The Taiwan Strait Game Between China and the United States: Risk Variables and Crisis Management,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Cao Qun","May 13, 2022","At present, the root cause of tension in the Taiwan Strait is the attempt by the DPP authorities to change the fact that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to the same China. Politicians such as Tsai Ing-wen, disregarding the well-being and safety of the Taiwanese people, delude themselves in thinking they can depend on the “empty promises” of external forces in a bid to “rely on foreign powers to seek independence,” but they are doomed to have no way out. China must be reunified and inevitably will be reunified. This is an unstoppable historical process and a major trend. Some people on the U.S. side, in the face of the worsening situation in Ukraine, are trying to “add fuel to the flames” of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on one hand, and on the other are trying to “let others suffer on their behalf” by deliberately drawing parallels between the Taiwan issue and the Ukraine issue and condoning and encouraging the development of “Taiwan independence” forces, which gravely violates the basic norms of international relations. The U.S. side should not indulge in “double standards” when it comes to international rules. As State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi has said, “There are fundamental differences between the Taiwan issue and the Ukraine issue. There is no comparison. The most fundamental difference is that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China’s territory and the Taiwan issue is entirely an internal affair of China, while the Ukraine issue is a dispute between Russia and Ukraine. It is a barefaced double standard for some people to emphasize the principle of sovereignty on the Ukraine issue, but keep undermining China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity on the Taiwan issue.” 81"
The Taiwan Strait Game Between China and the United States: Risk Variables and Crisis Management,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Cao Qun","May 13, 2022","Recently, the “negative” direction of U.S. policy on Taiwan has become increasingly apparent, and the Biden administration has exceeded its predecessor in words and deeds that hollow out the one-China policy. The latest weather vane is the “U.S. Relations with Taiwan, Bilateral Relations Fact Sheet” that was significantly revised and updated on May 5, 2022 82 (the previous version was released on August 31, 2018, under the Trump administration 83), removing “The United States does not support Taiwan independence” from the previous version, as well as “There is but one China, and Taiwan is part of China” and other related expressions. The U.S. side is well aware of the importance of such content for the U.S.-China relationship, but it still uses an “announce to the world” approach to engage in ploys of political manipulation on the Taiwan issue, which are highly suggestive of encouraging “Taiwan independence” elements and “fanning the flames” in the Taiwan Strait."
The Taiwan Strait Game Between China and the United States: Risk Variables and Crisis Management,"Asia-Pacific Security and Maritime Affairs , Cao Qun","May 13, 2022","The Taiwan issue concerns China’s core interests. The U.S. side has disregarded the one-China principle and the spirit of the three China-U.S. Joint Communiqués, and is colluding with the DPP authorities, continuously sending seriously wrong signals to the “Taiwan independence” forces and undermining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. On Taiwan-related issues, if the U.S. side does not reflect on the error of its “using Taiwan to control China” policy and continues to seek gains for itself by “walking a tightrope” or “slicing salami,” it will surely be “playing with fire and end up burning itself.” Given the growing gap between the U.S. and Chinese policy positions on the meaning and content of “one China,” and the possibility of the Taiwan authorities using the situation in Ukraine to play more tricks, U.S.-Taiwan collusion may continue to escalate in the short term, especially before the U.S. midterm elections. The risk variables of the U.S.-China game in the Taiwan Strait are likely to continue to grow and even “spill over” to other areas, and the normal development of economic and trade cooperation between China and other countries may also be “compromised.” In the current situation of increased uncertainty and instability in the Taiwan Strait, China and the United States should meet each other half way and use actions to create a good atmosphere. The U.S. side in particular must be vigilant to avoid any provocative behavior that heightens regional tensions and is likely to cause misunderstandings and misjudgments."

In the keynote speech, he presented, for the first time to all the world, the Global Security Initiative, which includes “six commitments,” namely: “…that we stay committed to the vision of a common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and work together to maintain world peace and security; stay committed to respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, uphold non-interference in internal affairs, and respect the independent choices of development paths and social systems made by people in different countries; stay committed to abiding by the purposes and principles of the U.N.

Based on profound strategic insights into current realities, it has great value in guiding global security practices."
The Theoretical Foundation of the Global Security Initiative—The Holistic View of National Security,"Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) , Feng Weijiang","Jun 16, 2022","At the first meeting of the National Security Commission in April 2014, General Secretary Xi Jinping creatively put forward a holistic approach to national security. The 19th Party Congress incorporated the commitments of the holistic approach to national security into the basic strategy of upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era and wrote them into the Party constitution. The holistic approach to national security is the first instance in the history of the Chinese Communist Party of major strategic thinking being established as the guiding thought for national security work. It is an important conceptual and theoretical contribution by contemporary China to the world. In December 2020, while presiding over the 26th Study Session of the 19th Politburo, General Secretary Xi Jinping gave a comprehensive, systematic, and complete presentation of the holistic approach to national security, in which he elucidated the overall goals of national security work in the new era and put forward the work requirements of the “ten adherences.”"

In this resolution, it ranked “safeguarding national security” as a historical achievement of the cause of the Party and the country in the new era and as one of the great historical transformations that have occurred; it systematically and comprehensively summed up the precious experience and major achievements of the Party in pushing forward the construction of national security systems and capabilities in the new era; and it put forward the “five coordinations,” namely “coordinating between development and security, between opening up and security, between traditional and non-traditional security, between China’s domestic security and the common security of the world, and between safeguarding national security and creating conditions conducive to it.” The resolution thus constitutes important content embodying the “holistic nature” of the holistic approach to national security."
The Theoretical Foundation of the Global Security Initiative—The Holistic View of National Security,"Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) , Feng Weijiang","Jun 16, 2022","The “ten adherences” and “five coordinations” of the holistic approach to national security provide an important theoretical foundation for the “six commitments” of the Global Security Initiative. For example, “persist in promoting international common security,” which is part of the “ten adherences,” frames the core concept of the global security initiative, as well as its basic premises, its fundamental rules, its important principles, and its program of implementation paths and practical orientations. To give another example, “coordinating between traditional security and non-traditional security,” which is one of the “five coordinations,” covers the “six commitments” requirement of maintaining security in traditional and non-traditional domains, and “coordinating between China’s domestic security and the common security of the world” contains the content of “stay committed to respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries” and “stay committed to taking the legitimate security concerns of all countries seriously.”"
The Theoretical Foundation of the Global Security Initiative—The Holistic View of National Security,"Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) , Feng Weijiang","Jun 16, 2022","The national security connotations and extensions established by the holistic approach to national security, based on a refining of excellent Chinese traditional culture and a summing up and original development of Marxist national security theory, rise to the heights of building a human community with a shared future. They possess abundant and precious values of all humankind and lay the scientific foundation for the ultimate worldwide acceptance of the Global Security Initiative. For all countries, and especially for the major powers, the connotations of national security are even more wide-ranging and its extensions are even broader. Their main manifestations arise in several areas, namely duality of interests, continuity of conditions, consistency of real feelings, correlation of the group to the self, and multidimensionality of domains. The connotations and extensions of national security in the current era need to be clarified for a more accurate understanding of the theoretical content and value orientations of the “six commitments.”"
The Theoretical Foundation of the Global Security Initiative—The Holistic View of National Security,"Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) , Feng Weijiang","Jun 16, 2022","First, national security objects or the national interests to which they are directed and which they safeguard not only include a great variety of material interests, but also encompass a wide array of non-material interests such as institutions, reputations, and values. The essence of national security is the safeguarding or assurance of national interests. In different times and places, a state will define and rank its own interest categories and their relative importance differently; the content and priorities of national security that is of concern to it will likewise vary. In the current era, national security has already gone far beyond the traditional categories of national territory and military security and seeks to protect many kinds of material—and especially non-material—national interests. Each country decides and ranks matters of national security priority according to its own national interest preferences. The more this becomes a reality, the more important it is to adopt the common ground principle of the Global Security Initiative, that of “abiding by the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter” as the rule rather than trying to intolerantly press ahead with one’s “own set of rules” that underhandedly push one’s own selfish interests and infringe upon the institutional, reputational, and value interests of other countries."
The Theoretical Foundation of the Global Security Initiative—The Holistic View of National Security,"Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) , Feng Weijiang","Jun 16, 2022","Second, national security objectives not only emphasize that national interests be in a secure condition, but also emphasize that the country be capable of sustainably safeguarding a secure condition. Some research also emphasizes security as the condition of being free of dangers or threats. For example, “If a country does not need to sacrifice its core values when preferring not to wage war, but can wage victorious war and maintain its values when challenged, this country is secure.” There is also research which considers security as equivalent to the ability to ensure security. For example, “National security is the ability of one nation state to use economic, military, political, diplomatic, and judicial measures to overcome domestic and international threats.” In the current era, to emphasize exclusively either condition or capability indicates an incomplete understanding of national security. A secure condition is an assessment of an overall static state wherein the security capability is sufficient to overcome security threats, and security capability reflects a historic assurance of security sustainability. It is only through a combination of the two that national security can be grasped within a dynamic equilibrium. This is the proper significance of the conceptual emphasis placed by the Global Security Initiative on the “sustainability of security.”"
The Theoretical Foundation of the Global Security Initiative—The Holistic View of National Security,"Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) , Feng Weijiang","Jun 16, 2022","Third, the secure condition of a country includes not only the assurance that its national interests are in an objectively secure condition, but also includes a subjective security status that assures an accurate understanding of this condition and a “sense of security.” A country that objectively is not endangered or threatened, but that subjectively lacks a “sense of security” is a country that is relatively security sensitive and that is subject to severe security risks triggered by minor disturbances. A country that is objectively beset with difficulties, but that subjectively disregards risks and turns a blind eye to threats is likewise subject to disruptive national security crises. The only durable national security is one wherein subjective experience and understanding are commensurate with objective conditions. This means that both the commitment to “respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries” and the commitment to “taking the legitimate security concerns of all countries seriously” are very important in the Global Security Initiative. Security status is highly related to understanding. It is necessary to adhere to the principle of indivisible security, enabling each party with a security concern to be whole in terms of both its objective and subjective security, while opposing the establishment of one country’s security on the foundation of other countries’ insecurity. Ultimately, attempts arising from the lack of a sense of security to gain the initiative by striking the first blow through top-down “color revolutions” or armed invasions will plunge regions, or even the world, into security dilemmas."
The Theoretical Foundation of the Global Security Initiative—The Holistic View of National Security,"Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) , Feng Weijiang","Jun 16, 2022","Fourth, in the current era, how national security is implemented should not be limited to the security of one’s own country, but should also emphasize the common security of all countries. Against a background of economic globalization, the national interests of each country are interwoven with the interests of all other countries. To be fully realized, national security must be supported by international security or common security. Some countries define common security narrowly. For example, the national security strategy of the United States limits common security to “like-minded” allies. This way of differentiating between allies and rivals and of pursuing absolute security for oneself and one’s allies often results in a situation of “uniting with those that agree and attacking those who do not” on a regional or even global scale, with a tendency towards “acting from a position of strength,” i.e., using power or violence to resolve differences or disputes between countries. This contradicts the “peaceful approach employing dialogue and consultation” emphasized by the Global Security Initiative. Adherence to the idea of a human community that has a shared future and that one treats as one’s own family is the only way that countries will have an intrinsic motivation to peacefully resolve disputes through dialogue and consultation."
The Theoretical Foundation of the Global Security Initiative—The Holistic View of National Security,"Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) , Feng Weijiang","Jun 16, 2022","Fifth, in the current era, extensions of national security should be able to cover the main traditional and non-traditional security domains and undergo dynamic adjustment as the core and major interest domains of countries change. This could be defined as “integrating core and extended key domains in one national security system.” Ancient China regarded “land, people, and governance” as the three treasures of a country. References in modern Western political theory to a “country” have a similar threefold meaning: country (i.e., national territory), nation, and state. The handling of traditional and non-traditional security threats to these three main objects has always been the core security concern of China and all foreign countries, in both ancient and modern times. In this regard, the Global Security Initiative commitment “to maintaining security in both traditional and non-traditional domains” should certainly entail paying special attention to planning for those risks and challenges that could endanger the security of the country, the nation, and the state. In other words, security issues relating to areas such as military affairs, economics, culture, society, science and technology, ecology, resources, nuclear technology, overseas interests, biology, space, deep seas, polar regions, and artificial intelligence often interact and are interwoven. Overall planning should be conducted to eliminate these issues so as to avoid producing an impact on the situation as a whole, which would result if these issues were to rise above a certain limit in respect to scale, scope, or level."
The Theoretical Foundation of the Global Security Initiative—The Holistic View of National Security,"Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) , Feng Weijiang","Jun 16, 2022","In summary, functions of national security in the current era take into account the security of material interests and the security of non-material interests, objective security and subjective security, security status and security capability, and domestic security and common security. These extend to and broadly involve core and many important security domains, and they are closely connected to the larger background of this new era in which profound changes in the world unseen in a century are turbulently interacting with the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. These security features require a tolerant, scientific, and global initiative to guide and coordinate the security interests of all countries. The Global Security Initiative provides a classical Chinese solution and makes an important Chinese contribution."
The U.S. Deterrence Strategy and the Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"Contemporary International Relations , Zuo Xiying","May 20, 2022","Following the end of the Cold War, NATO continuously expanded eastwards, and Ukraine became an outpost of U.S. and Russian confrontation. In the wake of Ukraine’s color revolutions, Russia and Ukraine descended into antagonism and conflict. During the 2014 Russia-Ukraine conflict, Russia adopted a hybrid war approach. By combining conventional with non-conventional troops and tactics, it achieved an enormous strategic success.  1 To reinforce deterrence against Russia, the United States launched the “European Reassurance Initiative” (later changing its name to the “European Deterrence Initiative”). This helped Ukraine to strengthen its military build-up and augment its ability to resist Russia militarily. The Ukraine situation again deteriorated after November 2021. The United States, in an attempt to stop the outbreak of war through deterrence, repeatedly sent threatening signals to Russia. However, after Russian President Putin, on February 21, 2022, declared the “Donetsk People’s Republic” and “Lugansk People’s Republic” in eastern Ukraine to be independent countries and ordered the Russian army to enter the two territories, and after a Russia-Ukraine conflict once again broke out on February 24, the U.S. deterrence strategy headed for failure. However, the economic and financial sanctions that the United States is now imposing on Russia and the massive military aid that it is providing Ukraine have formed a new deterrence logic and new deterrence effects. With this as the background, it is necessary to conduct a more in-depth and systematic analysis and evaluation of how the United States devised its deterrence strategy."

When the crisis first broke out, the United States’ reaction was based on a crisis response mode. That is, the United States had to declare a position and exhibit resolve while calming the fears and concerns that its NATO allies had about Russia. As the situation stabilized, the United States strengthened its strategic planning, expanded its military aid to Ukraine, and thereby bolstered its deterrence against Russia. The adjustments to the U.S. strategy reflected a shift in its center of policy gravity, behind which lay a conceptual and cognitive change. In the seven years that followed, the United States continuously reinforced Ukraine-related deterrent capabilities to prevent Russia from taking further action. Specifically, the United States made two main adjustments to its strategic design. The first was to launch a strategic initiative to deter Russia. On June 3, 2014, Obama announced the “European Reassurance Initiative,” which requested 1.0 billion U.S. dollars in fiscal year 2015 as aid to the relevant European countries in order to calm NATO allies and deter Russia. It primarily included an increase in exercises, training, and rotations in Eastern Europe; the deployment of detachments of U.S. planners to help allies to strengthen their ability to design and organize training and exercises; the pre-deployment of military equipment and improvement of infrastructure in European countries to facilitate rapid deployment of U.S. forces; an increase in U.S. naval deployments in the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea; and the establishment of close partnerships with Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine. 2 However, the European Reassurance Initiative merely resolved some of the concerns of the United States’ European allies. Militarily, it contained little that was new and it could not cope with Russia’s military operations in eastern Ukraine. In February 2018, the United States changed the name of the European Reassurance Initiative to the European Deterrence Initiative, with the aim of continuing to strengthen the U.S. deterrent and defensive posture, committing to the protection of the territorial integrity of NATO allies and partners, and improving the preparedness and reaction capabilities of U.S. forces and allies."
The U.S. Deterrence Strategy and the Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"Contemporary International Relations , Zuo Xiying","May 20, 2022","In terms of content, the European Reassurance Initiative and the European Deterrence Initiative introduced by the United States covered five main areas: augmenting military presence, exercises and training, reinforcing pre-deployments, improving infrastructure, and building up partnership capabilities. In terms of funding flows, augmenting military presence, and reinforcing pre-deployments accounted for the largest shares (Figure 1). The reason for this was that the United States, needing to react to the Russian military operations, carried out deployments on a rotational basis in Eastern Europe, thus strengthening its military presence there and sending a message of deterrence to Russia. In addition, the United States also became aware of the need to pre-deploy military hardware and strategic resources in order to reduce redeployment time and costs in the event of a conflict and to raise war readiness. Therefore, whether viewed in terms of its name or its policy focus, the European Deterrence Initiative placed more emphasis on putting on a show of strength to Russia in an attempt to reinforce deterrence so as to dissuade Russia from taking military action."

The U.S. Deterrence Strategy and the Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"Contemporary International Relations , Zuo Xiying","May 20, 2022","The second major adjustment was to reinforce security cooperation with Ukraine. Following the eruption of the Crimean crisis, the United States promptly enhanced its security relationship with Ukraine. In addition to assisting Ukraine in security matters, the United States’ initial actions included supporting Ukraine in establishing security and stability, coping with humanitarian and reconstruction needs, conducting democratic elections and constitutional reforms, bringing about economic recovery, and fighting corruption. Security aid was just one aspect of the U.S. initial aid package to Ukraine, and it was not even the most important aspect. This was because the urgent task facing the United States was to help Ukraine cope with a small-scale war. Helping Ukraine prepare for a large-scale war was a medium-term or long-term task. Moreover, the Obama administration tried to occupy the moral high ground by emphasizing the role of values in its foreign policy. However, the United States quickly realized the critical importance of security cooperation with Ukraine. With the support of NATO, Ukraine initiated defense reform in 2015. It planned to increase its military strength, reinforce interoperability between Ukraine’s armed forces and NATO, and establish credible military deterrence against Russia. Under the Trump administration, the United States further raised the level of its security cooperation with Ukraine. The United States and Ukraine entered a stage of in-depth cooperation. In 2019, by means of a constitutional amendment, Ukraine wrote accession to NATO into its constitution. This act won a positive response from the United States. On June 12, 2020, Ukraine received “NATO Enhanced Opportunities Partner status,” which provided further institutional safeguards for enhancing partnership interoperability between NATO and Ukraine."
The U.S. Deterrence Strategy and the Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"Contemporary International Relations , Zuo Xiying","May 20, 2022","The United States shifted its focus from political issues to security issues with the objective of helping Ukraine to improve its military capabilities for deterring Russia. When the Crimean crisis erupted in 2014, Ukraine’s national defense system had already been in disrepair for many years. The armed forces lacked combat experience and basic strategic materials. Overall, they performed very poorly. Therefore, the United States and its allies provided the Ukrainian armed forces with large-scale military aid in the four areas below."
The U.S. Deterrence Strategy and the Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"Contemporary International Relations , Zuo Xiying","May 20, 2022","First was the provision of financial aid. After the Crimean crisis, Ukraine greatly increased its own military budget. According to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, military spending accounted for just 1.6% of Ukraine’s gross domestic product in 2013, but this proportion rose to 3.2% in 2021. 3 At the same time, the United States and its allies also greatly expanded their security aid to Ukraine. According to statistics, U.S. financial aid to Ukraine underwent a large increase beginning in 2014 and totaled more than 2.7 billion U.S. dollars as of 2020 (Figure 2). U.S. military aid programs to Ukraine are relatively complex. The main sources are the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, overseen by the Department of Defense, and Foreign Military Support, overseen by the State Department. According to statistics from the U.S. Congressional Research Service, these two projects provided approximately 1.317 billion U.S. dollars and 624 million U.S. dollars, respectively, of security aid to Ukraine in fiscal years 2016 through 2021. 4 In addition, Cooperative Threat Reduction, the European Deterrence Initiative, and International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement also provided some funding."
The U.S. Deterrence Strategy and the Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"Contemporary International Relations , Zuo Xiying","May 20, 2022","Second was the strengthening of personnel training. As early as April 2015, the United States sent 300 soldiers from the 173rd Airborne Brigade to train troops in Ukraine. Then, to cope with external threats from Russia, the United States led the establishment of an interoperable combat training center operated by NATO. In this combat training center, the U.S. military has continually been stationing units in Ukraine on a rotating basis to train troops there as a way of reversing the trends of Ukraine’s post-Cold War neglect of training, infrastructure construction, and equipment procurement and of strengthening the Ukrainian military’s deterrent capabilities. An analysis of the statistics shows that, from fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2019, the United States provided military training to at least 10,629 Ukrainian personnel. 5 Jens Stoltenberg, Secretary General of NATO, also acknowledged that: “Over the years, Allies have trained tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops.” 6 This training has been very helpful in enabling the Ukrainian military to become familiar with NATO intelligence transmissions and in raising their battlefield situation awareness. Some analysis indicates that, having undergone both NATO training and battlefield combat experience, the new generation of Ukrainian soldiers have overturned the top-down Soviet leadership model and are causing lethal damage to the Russian army [translator’s note: the English text cited actually states that it is ‘the old Soviet model of top-down leadership that has paralyzed Russian units…’; the Chinese seems to be a mistaken reading of this point]. 7"
The U.S. Deterrence Strategy and the Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"Contemporary International Relations , Zuo Xiying","May 20, 2022","Third was the provision of weapons and equipment support. Because U.S.-Russian relations are highly sensitive, and initially the main goal of the United States was to help Ukraine to fight the anti-government armed forces in eastern Ukraine, the aid provided by the United States was “non-lethal aid,” mainly consisting of Humvees, medical supplies, body armor, and radar systems. However, Trump adjusted the relevant U.S. policies in December 2017, giving the greenlight to the sale of lethal weapons to Ukraine. On February 28, 2018, the U.S. State Department permitted the sale of 210 Javelin anti-tank missiles and 37 launchers. Javelin anti-tank missiles are portable anti-tank weapons that, by using infrared focal plane array seekers, have powerful target recognition capability and are lethally effective against tanks and infantry. Thus, this move reinforced deterrence against Russia. Ukraine subsequently used Foreign Military Support and national funds to procure equipment such as Javelin anti-tank missiles and Mark VI patrol boats through the Foreign Military Sales system. It procured large quantities of guns, ammunition, and other laser imaging guidance equipment by means of direct commercial sale. The army also provided important equipment such as sniper rifles, counter battery radars, satellite image and analysis capabilities, and anti-UAV systems."
The U.S. Deterrence Strategy and the Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"Contemporary International Relations , Zuo Xiying","May 20, 2022","Fourth was the improvement of interoperability. The United States guided Ukraine towards integration with the NATO system and improved its interoperability with the NATO military system. This process specifically involved three steps. First was strengthening security cooperation mechanisms. After obtaining “NATO Enhanced Opportunities Partner status” in 2020, Ukraine was able to participate in all military actions and exercises within the NATO framework and to obtain more military aid and intelligence support. Second was the large-quantity procurement of NATO weapons, equipment, and combat systems, and the systematic study of NATO operational concepts. Third was the reinforcement of training through military exercises. The aim of Exercise Rapid Trident, held once a year by Ukraine and NATO, was to strengthen Ukraine’s interoperability with NATO and to display the military preparedness of NATO and Ukraine. The scale of this exercise exhibited a continuous upward trend. From 1,300 in 2014, the number of participants grew to 6,000 in 2021."
The U.S. Deterrence Strategy and the Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"Contemporary International Relations , Zuo Xiying","May 20, 2022","There were two aspects to the United States’ basic strategic design and strategic plans in the 2014–2021 period: while reinforcing its security relationship with Ukraine, it increased Ukraine’s deterrent capabilities so as to dissuade Russia from further action. At the same time that it was reinforcing bilateral security relations, the United States sought to promote a transformation of Ukraine’s defense. That is, while de-Sovietizing institutional systems, weapons and equipment, and operational concepts, it NATO-ized combat systems. Through seven years of effort, there was a huge improvement in the defensive and deterrent capabilities of Ukraine’s armed forces. 8"

The U.S. Deterrence Strategy and the Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"Contemporary International Relations , Zuo Xiying","May 20, 2022","From 2021, Russia-Ukraine relations took a sudden turn for the worse, and the Ukraine crisis again escalated. On March 25, Ukrainian President Zelensky approved the new Military Security Strategy, confirming that Russia was still Ukraine’s military enemy. On July 12, Russian President Putin published a long essay, On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians, in which he maintained the notion that Russians and Ukrainians were one people. On November 10, the United States and Ukraine signed the U.S.-Ukraine Charter on Strategic Partnership, which clearly spelled out U.S. support for Ukraine against an armed Russian invasion. The related Ukrainian policies elicited a strong reaction from Russia, which massed more than 100,000 troops on Ukraine’s border. Putin also presented demands to the United States and NATO, insisting that Ukraine never be allowed to join NATO and threatening to use military force. Under these circumstances, the Biden administration tried using a deterrence strategy to deter Russia. It mainly made use of the following three methods."
The U.S. Deterrence Strategy and the Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"Contemporary International Relations , Zuo Xiying","May 20, 2022","The first method was to convey a clear deterrence message. After November 2021, having used its intelligence systems to gain a clear picture of Russia’s strategic intentions and military deployments, the Biden administration became greatly concerned about the situation. Faced with a new round of the Ukraine crisis, the Biden administration uncharacteristically declared right away that it would not send troops to intervene in conflict, but at the same time it also tried to send Russia a clear deterrence message in an effort to dissuade Russia from military action. To summarize, the United States clearly issued three deterrence signals to Russia. The first deterrence signal was to threaten Russia with unprecedented economic and financial sanctions if it took military action. This appeared in three calls between Biden and Putin and in multiple statements by senior U.S. officials. Biden clearly stated in a December 7, 2021 video call with Putin that “the United States and its allies would respond with strong economic and other measures in the event of military escalation.” 9 On December 30, Biden spoke with Putin by phone and threatened that Russia would suffer severe sanctions if it took military action and that there would be “a heavy price to pay for it.” 10 In another call between Biden and Putin on February 12, 2022, Biden reiterated that the sanctions by the United States and its allies would “impose swift and severe costs on Russia.” It is not hard to see that the intention of the United States was to send a message of deterrence to the senior leadership of Russia. That is, it could force Russia to pay a heavy price through economic sanctions without having to dispatch troops. As U.S. Secretary of State Blinken said, “The purpose of the sanctions in the first instance is to try to deter Russia from going to war. As soon as you trigger them, that deterrent is gone. And until the last minute, as long as we can try to bring a deterrent effect to this, we’re going to try to do that.” 11"
The U.S. Deterrence Strategy and the Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"Contemporary International Relations , Zuo Xiying","May 20, 2022","The second deterrence signal was to warn Russia that it would be isolated by the international community if it took military action. The United States threatened to expel Russia from Western society and to attack Russia’s international standing. On January 25, 2022, the Biden administration issued a severe warning to Russia: the United States, in conjunction with its allies and partners, has prepared economic deterrence measures, including severe economic sanctions and export controls. The former will have an obvious impact on the day they are implemented, and the latter will weaken Russia in the medium term. 12 Biden stated to Putin on several occasions that these sanctions by the United States and its allies would exceed the 2014 sanctions in their intensity and would have a profound and long-lasting impact on Russia. During the February 12 call, Biden threatened Putin, saying that Russia’s military action would cause widespread human suffering and weaken Russia’s standing, with the result that Russia would become internationally isolated.13 At the Munich Security Conference on February 19, U.S. Vice President Harris also issued a threat, namely that the U.S. sanctions would “target those who are complicit and those who aid and abet this unprovoked invasion.” 14"
The U.S. Deterrence Strategy and the Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"Contemporary International Relations , Zuo Xiying","May 20, 2022","The third deterrence signal was to threaten to provide military assistance to Ukraine to make it difficult for Russia to win a war or to make it pay a heavy price for launching a war. In early discussions within the U.S. policy community, some analysts recommended large increases in military aid to Ukraine. They believed that the United States would have to accelerate delivery of the relevant military hardware to prevent Russia from quickly achieving victory. This would lower Russian military effectiveness and increase the strategic cost to Russia of taking military action. 15 During the December 7, 2021 video call, Biden threatened Putin, saying: “We would provide additional defensive material to the Ukrainians, above and beyond that which we already provided. And we would fortify our NATO allies on the eastern flank with additional capabilities in response to such an escalation.” 16 Such deterrence signaling by the United States was a way of warning Russia that it would not win a war easily and that war would become a quagmire which would continuously wear it down."
The U.S. Deterrence Strategy and the Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"Contemporary International Relations , Zuo Xiying","May 20, 2022","The second method was to announce relevant intelligence. Back in the fall of 2021, Biden signed a decryption and intelligence-sharing plan designed and overseen by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. This plan won the support of Secretary of State Blinken, Central Intelligence Agency Director William Burns, and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines. On November 2, Biden sent a delegation headed by CIA Director Burns to Moscow. In a meeting with Putin, they expressed their serious concern over the Russian military buildup and claimed that the United States had already come into possession of intelligence on Russia’s imminent invasion of Ukraine. The Biden administration then used multiple channels to disclose a large amount of intelligence information."
The U.S. Deterrence Strategy and the Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"Contemporary International Relations , Zuo Xiying","May 20, 2022","First, was [intelligence on] Russian military deployments and military preparations. On December 3, 2021, the Biden administration disclosed an intelligence document to the Washington Post that included satellite images: according to information in the possession of U.S. intelligence departments, Russia had massed 175,000 troops on the Ukraine border.17 On January 13, 2022, the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) also issued a warning that “Russia may invade Ukraine” and conducted military simulations to analyze in detail possible Russian military attack directions.18 On January 28, the U.S. intelligence agencies announced that the Russian military buildup near Ukraine had expanded to include the supply of blood and other medical resources and that they regarded this as a key indicator of Russian military preparations. In response to the military withdrawal announced by Russia on February 15, the United States stated that, according to the intelligence in its possession, the withdrawal from the Ukrainian border announced by Russia was a meticulously designed trick intended to mislead the United States and other powers. Second, was the announcement of specific dates on which Russia might take military action. Biden, Secretary of State Blinken, National Security Advisor Sullivan, and relevant personnel of the intelligence departments on more than 10 occasions publicly released warnings that Russia would invade Ukraine on a specific date. The clearest of these was the Biden administration’s call to Americans in Ukraine to depart. On February 11, U.S. National Security Advisor Sullivan, calling for the departure of Americans from Ukraine, expressed the opinion that “the risk is now high enough and the threat is now urgent enough.” 19 The Biden administration used this to send a message to Russia. That is, it asked Russia to prove that “we were wrong.” To a great extent, this disrupted Russia’s war plans. Third, was the disclosure of intelligence relating to Russian “false flag operations” and “decapitation strikes.” The United States responded in a targeted way to Russian information concerning Ukrainian attacks on civilians and military operations against eastern Ukraine. By disclosing a propaganda video made by Russia and announcing in advance potential Russian moves to launch “false flag” operations, the United States aimed to stop Russia from “framing” Ukraine and prevent it from using this incident as an excuse for taking military action. Sullivan claimed that Russia had a “kill list” and was planning to detain or kill Zelensky and other famous Ukrainian figures.20 By proactively disclosing intelligence, the Biden administration hoped to call Putin’s bluff and defeat Russia’s plans."
The U.S. Deterrence Strategy and the Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"Contemporary International Relations , Zuo Xiying","May 20, 2022","During the current Russia-Ukraine conflict, the United States’ intelligence about Russian military operations has been very accurate. The reason for this is that the United States has adjusted its intelligence organization systems, which for the past 20 years had been concentrating on the war on terror, shifting their focus to competition with China and Russia. In early 2020, the CIA underwent a comprehensive review and reorganization so as to emphasize strategic thinking rather than reporting matters that occurred just five minutes ago. In October 2021, the CIA strengthened existing centers and established the China Mission Center, focusing on gathering intelligence about China and Russia and concentrating particularly on collecting and analyzing intelligence on the highest-level leaders of China and Russia. The United States also made ample use of open-source intelligence and obtained much open-source information from on the ground in Ukraine. Some even came from Russian territory. In addition, the U.S. government also encouraged companies to share commercial satellite photographs with the U.S. government, to track Russian military deployments and battlefield situations, giving a huge boost to U.S. intelligence work. The U.S. choice to disclose intelligence was thoroughly weighed and discussed. First, it was felt that credible intelligence could deter Russia from initiating the war. In his speech to the United Nations, U.S. Secretary of State Blinken said, “If Russia doesn’t invade Ukraine, then we will be relieved that Russia changed course and proved our predictions wrong.”21 Second, it was felt that it would disrupt Russia’s war plans. In the intelligence war between the United States and Russia, the following pattern emerged: whenever Russia declared an intention, the United States immediately released some evidence that Russia was lying. This caused enormous damage to Russia. In a U.S. Senate hearing on March 10, 2022, CIA Director Burns stated: “We have had a great deal of effect disrupting their tactics and their calculations and demonstrating to the entire world that this is premeditated and unprovoked aggression built on a body of lies and false narratives.”22 Third, it was felt that disclosing intelligence would spur the relevant European countries to change their view of the Russia-Ukraine situation. In November 2021, the United States initiated multilateral, high-level cooperation with the intelligence agencies of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy, but the European countries felt that there was still room for negotiation. The publication of this intelligence gradually changed the views of France and Germany and to a great extent unified the European allies."
The U.S. Deterrence Strategy and the Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"Contemporary International Relations , Zuo Xiying","May 20, 2022","The third method was to reinforce the military presence in Eastern Europe and increase military aid to Ukraine to send a powerful signal to Russia. As the Ukrainian situation deteriorated, the United States increased military aid to Ukraine. In late November 2021, the United States dispatched an additional 160 members of the Florida National Guard to Ukraine to provide training, advice, and guidance to the Ukrainian military. The United States also increased weapons aid to Ukraine. According to statistics, the United States has provided in excess of 6.4 billion U.S. dollars in security aid for the purpose of training and equipping the Ukrainians. 23The United States also mobilized its NATO allies to take Soviet-style weapons from their stocks and supply them as aid to Ukraine. In addition, the United States also reinforced its defensive deployments in Eastern Europe so as to increase the strategic deterrence against Russia. On January 24, 2022, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin ordered 8,500 U.S. soldiers to be placed on “heightened preparedness” for possible deployment to Eastern Europe. On February 2, the United States dispatched 1,700 troops to Poland. On February 11, Biden ordered 3,000 more troops to Poland in addition to 300 troops deployed earlier from Germany, making a total of 5,000 troops. Lastly, the United States also united with its allies. It reinforced strategic cooperation with its NATO allies and thereby demonstrated resolve to Russia."
The U.S. Deterrence Strategy and the Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"Contemporary International Relations , Zuo Xiying","May 20, 2022","To summarize the above analysis, the United States not only sent threatening signals and made full use of a strategy of intelligence disclosures, but also reinforced the military presence in Eastern Europe, thereby demonstrating resolve to Russia in an attempt to deter Russia from taking military action. The basic intention of the United States was, by means of coercive threats, to force a change in the cost-benefit calculations of Russia’s military action decision-making process and thus to change Russia’s military behavior. The conceptual basis for this was the Biden administration’s “integrated deterrence” concept. That is, emphasizing the combination of new technologies, combat concepts, hard power, and allies and thereby forming a reliable, flexible, and powerful network approach."
The U.S. Deterrence Strategy and the Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"Contemporary International Relations , Zuo Xiying","May 20, 2022",III. Escalating the U.S. Deterrence Strategy
The U.S. Deterrence Strategy and the Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"Contemporary International Relations , Zuo Xiying","May 20, 2022","Russian President Putin first ordered the army into the two regions of Donetsk and Lugansk and then decided to send the troops into Ukraine. The fact that the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out again signified the failure of the United States’ strategy to attempt to dissuade Russia from military action through deterrence methods. So why did the U.S. deterrence strategy for the Ukraine issue fail? In theory, deterrence involves two sets of factors, that is, the relationship between strength and resolve and the relationship between coercive threats and reassurance. In academia, more people pay attention to the former, and relatively few pay attention to the latter. Regarding the latter, Thomas Schelling believed that any coercive threat required corresponding reassurance. 24 By examining these two relationships, one can pinpoint the root of the U.S. failure to deter Russia."
The U.S. Deterrence Strategy and the Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"Contemporary International Relations , Zuo Xiying","May 20, 2022","There were two problems with the U.S. deterrence strategy. First, the United States put too much emphasis on coercive threats and not enough on sending reassurance signals to Russia. The eastward expansion of NATO following the Cold War has formed a major security threat to Russia. The United States has long failed to give adequate attention to Russia’s security concerns. Of course, geopolitical and structural factors played a part in this, but the United States’ own strategic errors cannot be overlooked. In particular, Ukraine’s reorientation to the West and NATO’s continuous reinforcement of military aid to Ukraine were matters of serious concern to Russia, and the United States failed to reassure Russia on these core issues. These situations hardened the Russians’ understanding of the threats and reinforced their own sense of the reasonableness of taking military action."
The U.S. Deterrence Strategy and the Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"Contemporary International Relations , Zuo Xiying","May 20, 2022","Second, the Biden administration lacked a real military deterrent. The most powerful military deterrent would be U.S. resolve to dispatch troops. However, the United States declared early on in this Russia-Ukraine conflict that it would not intervene by sending in troops. The United States’ choice not to dispatch troops was made following a systematic evaluation. It was the logical choice. Ukraine is not a NATO member, nor is it of vital interest to the United States. Moreover, the United States has grown decadent in recent years and already lacks sufficient available resources for spending on war. The United States had already retreated from Afghanistan, and the desire not to become mired in another war was a consensus of the Biden administration. Therefore, the United States lacked sufficient military strength for a head on confrontation with Russia in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However, by announcing too early on that it would not send troops, the Biden administration exposed a flaw in its deterrence strategy. Nadia Schadlow, who served as a Deputy National Security Advisor in the previous administration, said: “By signaling that the U.S. had no intention of using its capabilities, the Biden administration seriously weakened their deterrent value.” 25 U.S. Congressman Mike Gallagher also believes that, although it was of course important that the Biden administration emphasized new technologies and alliances, deterrence ultimately depended on the Russians’ assessment of existing U.S. military strength and of U.S. willingness to use it. The Biden administration’s reliance on non-military punitive threats to deter Putin inevitably resulted in deterrence failure. 26 John Bolton, a National Security Advisor in the previous administration, believes that the reason for the failure of the Biden administration’s deterrence strategy lay in the fact that, though the threats they issued would not be implemented until after Russia crossed the Ukraine border, the United States had already lost all credibility with regard to threats of punishment. In addition, U.S. military strength was not on the table. This was a unilateral concession made without forcing Putin to pay a price.27"
The U.S. Deterrence Strategy and the Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"Contemporary International Relations , Zuo Xiying","May 20, 2022","When making a strategic assessment, Putin was not sufficiently impressed by the threats issued by the Biden administration, or he underestimated the scope and intensity of the sanctions that would be imposed by the United States and its allies. On the one hand, Putin paid too much attention to Russia’s external threats, emphasizing the reasonableness of its own claims. On February 21, 2022, Putin gave a talk on national television in which he claimed that NATO had “pushed military facilities and equipment to the Russian border, entirely without regard for our concerns, protests, and warnings.” Putin gave another television address on February 24. He said that if Russia remained indifferent as military and technological achievements were brought to the borders of Russia, the related military infrastructure would constitute “an absolutely unacceptable threat” for Russia. In Putin’s view, containment of NATO was, for Russia, “a matter of life and death,” “an existential matter,” and “a question of the continued existence of our state.” On the other hand, prior to taking military action, Putin himself felt that he clearly perceived the fact that the United States lacked the ability and resolve. He was insufficiently impressed by the threatening signals from the Biden administration. Hal Brands believes that Putin did not feel the weight of the deterrence signals from the United States because it was hard to assess how severe the penalties would be. 28 In fact, in the speech he gave on February 24, Putin claimed to have an “objective understanding” of the threat of Western sanctions and claimed that Russia’s “judgment was extremely objective and realistic.” However, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was surprised by the extent of the U.S. sanctions on Russia’s central bank. He stated frankly that no one could have predicted which sanctions the West would impose. 29"
The U.S. Deterrence Strategy and the Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"Contemporary International Relations , Zuo Xiying","May 20, 2022","Although the deterrence strategy failed to deter Russia from taking military action, the United States’ deterrence actions against Russia have by no means ended. In theoretical research, deterrence is generally separated into two forms: deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial. The former refers to the threat of punishing a rival by military or economic means. The latter aims to make a rival believe that they will not attain their objectives on the battlefield. The United States’ threat to use economic and financial sanctions against Russia is a typical example of deterrence by punishment. If deterrence by punishment fails, the deterring nation generally will choose to make good on its promise so as to guarantee its deterrence credibility. In this sense, the deterrence mechanism is still playing a role. Currently, U.S. deterrence against Russia has not stopped but instead is undergoing further escalation. It may be regarded as second-stage deterrence. At present, the United States is treating penalties against Russia as a deterrence tool for achieving broader objectives."
The U.S. Deterrence Strategy and the Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"Contemporary International Relations , Zuo Xiying","May 20, 2022","First, it is putting into effect the economic and financial sanctions that it had promised and continually escalating them in a timely way based on the situation. After Russia decided to take military action, the United States reinforced economic, financial, and technological embargoes and sanctions against Russia. The primary measures included: economic measures prohibiting new investment in Russia; expelling designated Russian banks from the SWIFT system; sanctions against key Russian state-owned enterprises; and financial sanctions against Russian government officials and their families. The United States also prohibited export of dual-use products to Russia, sanctioned over 1,000 Russian individuals and companies, and froze 630 billion U.S. dollars in foreign reserves of the Russian central bank. In addition, U.S. allies and partners correspondingly adopted a large number of sanction measures. The goal of the United States was to strike a huge blow against the Russian financial system and Russian foreign trade and thus make Russia pay a heavy economic price. According to forecasts by the U.S. government, Russian GDP will shrink 15% in 2022, erasing the economic gains of the past 15 years. 30"
The U.S. Deterrence Strategy and the Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"Contemporary International Relations , Zuo Xiying","May 20, 2022","Second, militarily, it is comprehensively aiding Ukraine and thus increasing the cost of the war to Russia. Since the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the United States has provided large amounts of security aid to Ukraine. On April 7, 2022, Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated that Western nations had already provided Ukraine with roughly 60,000 anti-tank weapons and 25,000 anti-aircraft weapons. 31 Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles are typical examples of such weapons. On April 13, the U.S. Department of Defense convened a meeting with the eight largest weapons manufacturers in preparation for large-scale export of weapons and equipment to Ukraine. According to statistics, the United States had provided Ukraine with more than 5,500 Javelin anti-tank missiles and more than 1,400 Stinger anti-aircraft missiles as of April 22. 32 Some analysis indicates that the Javelin anti-tank missiles and the Stinger anti-aircraft missiles already sent to Ukraine by the United States probably account for one-third and one-fourth, respectively, of total U.S. stockpiles. 33 The Biden administration’s policy indicates that the United States will further increase its military aid to Ukraine. Biden has proposed a 33-billion-dollar additional aid package for Ukraine so as to provide Ukraine with large-scale military assistance. Congress increased the figure to 39.8 billion U.S. dollars, with the House approving it on May 11. In addition, the United States has provided Ukraine with a large amount of intelligence concerning Russian military deployments and movements, giving enormous support to Ukrainian military operations. On April 13, Ukraine struck the guided missile cruiser Moskva, which was the flagship of the Russian Black Sea fleet, causing it to sink. U.S. government officials acknowledge that the U.S. provided intelligence to Ukraine which helped Ukraine to sink the Russian warship. 34 The United States has also provided Ukraine with intelligence about high-ranking generals in the Russian army so that Ukraine can target and kill and injure Russian generals. The U.S. decision to provide Ukraine with large-scale military aid has become a key factor shaping the future direction of the Russia-Ukraine conflict."
The U.S. Deterrence Strategy and the Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"Contemporary International Relations , Zuo Xiying","May 20, 2022","In a wider sense, the United States is imposing harsh military and economic punishments on Russia and is further reinforcing its deterrence measures. Its intentions in doing so are twofold. On the one hand, it is causing ample harm to Russia through economic and military bloodletting. With this it is bruising Russia on the levels of national strength and strategic psychology so as to create a deterrent effect on Russia far into the future. After its attack suffered a setback at the end of March 2022, Russia adjusted its military strategy. It retreated from Kiev and the surrounding suburbs and shifted its strategic center of gravity to eastern and southern Ukraine. The United States and its allies also quietly changed their pre-existing strategy. They comprehensively supported Ukraine militarily and switched their strategic goal to making Russia bleed, weakening Russia as much as possible. The United States increased its military aid to Ukraine with the objective of magnifying the harm to Russia. Specifically, by strangling Russia economically and financially, they could make Russia experience a punishing lethal force and prevent it from taking similar military action in other regions. At the same time, it sought to wear down Russia militarily through the Ukraine-Russia conflict so as to reduce Russian military strength and prevent it from employing war again as a means to change the situation in Ukraine. After visiting Kiev on April 25 and meeting with Zelensky, Austin pointed out that the United States hoped “to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine.” 35 He thus plainly revealed the main intention of the Biden administration. However, the U.S. shift in the Russia-Ukraine conflict from supporting Ukraine’s defensive efforts to wearing down and weakening Russia has caused a further deterioration in Russian-U.S. relations. It has added greatly to the uncertainty of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and increased the risk that Russia would threaten to use, or would use, nuclear weapons."
The U.S. Deterrence Strategy and the Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"Contemporary International Relations , Zuo Xiying","May 20, 2022","On the other hand, it has produced a powerful deterrent effect against China with regard to the Taiwan issue. The United States had another important intention concerning the Ukraine issue. Namely, by letting the Chinese leadership and people observe how Russia was being sanctioned by the United States and its allies and partners, and by showing the high cost that Russia was bearing, it sought to give shape to a psychological expectation that when China reunifies with Taiwan it must bear a high cost and to ultimately change the psychology and strategic arrangements of the Chinese leadership and people. For U.S. decision-makers, the greater the mess that Russian military operations become, the more severe its economic hemorrhaging, and the more its overall national power declines, the more striking the deterrent effect will be against China. Some analysts are of the opinion that the Russia-Ukraine conflict will cause China to become more cautious over the Taiwan issue. 36 In fact, all the parties involved with the Taiwan issue are studying the Russia-Ukraine conflict and trying to gain experience and lessons from it. For Western nations, the lessons and experience are clear, namely, that Taiwan must prepare for war—that it must both improve its defensive capabilities and strengthen its will to fight. This would be the only way to convince China that it cannot win on the battlefield or that it cannot bear the cost of reunification."
The U.S. Deterrence Strategy and the Russia-Ukraine Conflict,"Contemporary International Relations , Zuo Xiying","May 20, 2022","Deterrence is an important tool in U.S. national security strategy. However, the role that deterrence plays forever faces many theoretical and practical challenges—a point well demonstrated during the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The success of the U.S. deterrence strategy requires not only that the United States itself has powerful forces and strong resolve but that it can make the other side accurately feel the threat and have an accurate calculation of the costs and benefits. But the real world is complicated, and it is difficult to have both conditions present at once. Modern warfare and conflict often come coupled with information warfare, public opinion warfare, and psychological warfare, which undoubtedly exacerbates the difficulty of successful deterrence. It must be recognized that, although the U.S. failed in deterring Russia from adopting military action against Ukraine, the economic sanctions against Russia used by the U.S. and its allies and their military aid for Ukraine created a broader-scope deterrence effect for Russia and other countries. For China, the Russia-Ukraine conflict acts as a mirror—a model for us to assess how the United States’ deterrence strategy is devised. China needs not only to study in depth how the United States deters and how it punishes Russia, but also to carefully analyze how Russia perceives the United States’ threats, and to derive experience and lessons from therein. This is the only way that we can clearly see the real essence of this major international event, find new opportunities from within crises, and open a new game from within a changing game."

This article is an interview written by Meng Xiangfeng, a reporter from China Discipline Inspection and Supervision News, after interviewing Xi Jinping. It was published in the newspaper on April 19, 1996. This journal excerpts the content related to family education and talent, in order to inspire readers."
"To be an Ambitious Generation——An Interview with Xi Jinping, son of Xi Zhongxun","Parents , Xi Jinping","Apr 15, 1997","Xi Jinping is the sixth oldest in his family and has a daughter with his wife Peng Liyuan. When talking about the education and influence of the revolutionary seniors on him, he said that every step of his growth has been inseparable from the teachings and subtle influences of the revolutionary seniors. The biggest influence is that the revolutionary seniors have taught us to be a generation with ambition and a generation with achievements."
"To be an Ambitious Generation——An Interview with Xi Jinping, son of Xi Zhongxun","Parents , Xi Jinping","Apr 15, 1997",Xi Jinping said that the elder revolutionary predecessors have often reminded us to not act as the lost generation that only depends on their predecessors.
"To be an Ambitious Generation——An Interview with Xi Jinping, son of Xi Zhongxun","Parents , Xi Jinping","Apr 15, 1997","Our seniors have urged us to live a hard and simple life and to act as ordinary persons “with our tails tucked in.” In the imagination of ordinary people, a family like ours may dine on delicious foods all day long, but in fact, my family eats home-cooked meals. Our parents asked us not to have any leftover rice in our bowls and to pick up the rice that fell on the table and eat it. When I was a child, I often wore clothes with patches, old floral clothes, and shoes that my sister could no longer wear and dyed them black."
"To be an Ambitious Generation——An Interview with Xi Jinping, son of Xi Zhongxun","Parents , Xi Jinping","Apr 15, 1997","If we want to be effective, we must first be a person with knowledge and substance. My parents were very strict with my studies. In addition, our parents also forced us out of the “greenhouse” to accept social tempering. During the Cultural Revolution, I went to live and work in a production team in rural northern Shaanxi, and my life was very hard. Once I visited my father in prison and complained about the hardships. I thought I would gain his sympathy. Unexpectedly, my father said that it was a good thing to live and work in a production team. He told that even though he was locked up, he did not want me rushing to come to see him when he was released. Instead, he insisted that I join the masses at the grassroots level!"
"To be an Ambitious Generation——An Interview with Xi Jinping, son of Xi Zhongxun","Parents , Xi Jinping","Apr 15, 1997","In fact, I suffered more than the average person. During the Cultural Revolution, I went to prison four times. I was a “reactionary student,” and I was publicly shamed more than a dozen times. I was starved, and I was made a “beggar.” When I was 15 years old, I went to northern Shaanxi with “black materials” on my back, and I worked for seven years. Then, I grew from a “black five-category,” “mongrel,” and “reactionary student” to a League member and Party member, becoming the first secretary of the Party branch among the more than 27,000 Beijing-educated youths. In the rural areas of northern Shaanxi, I was a farmer and learned a full set of farm skills. I was one of the best laborers in the village. This experience has cultivated my will and self-confidence and made me feel that there is nothing in the world that is truly unbearable and that I can survive in the face of adversity. Now the conditions are much better than in the past, how can we not do well?"
"To be an Ambitious Generation——An Interview with Xi Jinping, son of Xi Zhongxun","Parents , Xi Jinping","Apr 15, 1997","During that period of adversity, I also had the greatest opportunity to get to know the people at the grassroots level, forged a deep friendship with them, understood the joys, sorrows, and triumphs of the common people, and understood what reality is. I am doing my work now to oppose pretentiousness because I know that the common people are most disgusted with formalism."
"To be an Ambitious Generation——An Interview with Xi Jinping, son of Xi Zhongxun","Parents , Xi Jinping","Apr 15, 1997","When it comes to being the child of a cadre, especially what should be paid attention to after entering politics, Xi Jinping said well:"
"To be an Ambitious Generation——An Interview with Xi Jinping, son of Xi Zhongxun","Parents , Xi Jinping","Apr 15, 1997","First of all, I have to correct a concept. The children of cadres are not a class, but a model. Each has his or her own experiences, pursuits, and methods and moves through various trends. The current public opinion is biased toward the evaluation of the children of cadres. One saying is: “The dragon gives birth to the dragon, and the phoenix gives birth to the phoenix.” I think there is an old saying that goes well: “The dragon gives birth to nine sons, each of which is different.” It’s not like “a dragon gives birth to a dragon, a phoenix gives birth to a phoenix, and the son of a mouse burrows into the ground.” The key to who the children of cadres will become in the future depends on their acquired efforts and pursuits."
"To be an Ambitious Generation——An Interview with Xi Jinping, son of Xi Zhongxun","Parents , Xi Jinping","Apr 15, 1997","As a son of a senior cadre, I think the most important thing is not to take the old roots of the father’s generation, but to rely on one’s own ability and not to have a sense of superiority. The father’s generation may have achieved great things, but the child is still an ordinary person and cannot engage in privileges. He must compete with others in a fair environment, be self-reliant, and stand on his own. As for what the cadre’s child can do, he can take on any profession. As long as he is a person who is beneficial to society, it is not a disgrace."
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","I. “Today Ukraine, tomorrow Taiwan:” Emotions are running high"
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","As many wise people at home and abroad have long warned, Russia-Ukraine relations and the Russia and Ukraine situation, which had been tense for years, have regrettably and disturbingly evolved into a state of war that the world did not want to see. On February 24, 2022, Russia launched a special military operation against Ukraine, which is still ongoing. The conflagration has left Ukraine devastated and a large number of refugees displaced."
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","As expected, the United States and NATO—the authors of today’s Russia-Ukraine relations and the Russia-Ukraine situation—have refused to defend Ukraine militarily and will never send troops to protect it, although they have joined some of their so-called allies in launching public condemnations, economic sanctions, and diplomatic coercion against Russia. On the contrary, they are making a fortune off the war, and, by prolonging the Russia-Ukraine war, are attempting to further weaken Russia and coerce the EU into maintaining their hegemony and interests."
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","Although the United States has called on the international community to join it in condemning and sanctioning Russia, few have responded, and most countries and regions have looked on indifferently. Despite Ukraine’s so-called stubborn resistance, Russia, which has seized the strategic initiative, has not stopped its action, and will certainly achieve its strategic goals. One can anticipate that post-war Ukraine will not only be yet more devastated, but will no longer be the pre-war Ukraine, and further division of the country is inevitable. In fact, it is well known that Ukraine, which has been consistently pro-U.S. and tried to join NATO for nearly 20 years, getting weaker all the way, is no longer the Ukraine that emerged from the former Soviet Union when it collapsed."
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","At present, there is unprecedented hostility across the Taiwan Strait and tension in the Taiwan Strait. The special military operation launched by Russia against Ukraine, the performance of the United States and NATO, the reaction of the international community, and the tragic situation and future of Ukraine have triggered a high degree of concern among the people and public opinion on the island from the outset. The doubts, worries, anxiety, and even panic of Taiwan’s people have also exploded on the island’s social media. “Today Ukraine, tomorrow Taiwan”—Many people in Taiwan are beginning to worry that Taiwan may in the future turn into today’s war-torn Ukraine. The Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities and political forces in Taiwan that seek “Taiwan independence” secession, as well as those Taiwanese people who support Taiwan independence and secession, appear to be calm in the face of today’s tragic situation in Ukraine, but they are actually in a constant state of panic!"
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","II. “Today Ukraine, tomorrow Taiwan:” Concerns are not excessive"
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","Strictly speaking, it is of course very inappropriate to use Russia-Ukraine relations and the Russia-Ukraine issue to view cross-Strait relations and the Taiwan Strait issue. Cross-Strait relations and the Taiwan Strait issue are fundamentally different from Russia-Ukraine relations and the Russia-Ukraine issue. Russia-Ukraine relations are relations between sovereign states; cross-Strait relations are relations between different regions of the same sovereign state, China. The Russia-Ukraine issue is a matter of one sovereign state’s diplomatic behavior endangering the security of another sovereign state, while the Taiwan Strait issue is a matter of China’s Taiwan region colluding with external forces in an attempt to split from China and undermine China’s sovereignty, security, development, and other core national interests."
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","Although cross-Strait relations and the Taiwan Strait issue are fundamentally different from Russia-Ukraine relations and the Russia-Ukraine issue, if Taiwan continues down the path of independence and secession, the state of the Russia-Ukraine situation today will likely appear at the Taiwan Strait level tomorrow. “Today Ukraine, tomorrow Taiwan” is not impossible! That is because the mainland has a firm bottom line and has drawn a red line, and the “Taiwan independence” forces that are trying to overstep the mainland’s bottom line are touching the red line drawn by the mainland."
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","1. The mainland has a bottom line and a red line, and “Taiwan independence” secession means war"
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","Mainland China considers peaceful reunification to be in the best interest of the Chinese nation and the country as a whole, and is therefore willing to do its best to achieve it, but that is based on the fact that both sides of the Taiwan Strait have always agreed that the two sides belong to the same country and are willing to reunify and meet each other half way. Moreover, mainland China has principles and a bottom line, and will never sit on its hands while the “Taiwan independence” separatist forces and international anti-China forces collude to split Taiwan from China."
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","In fact, mainland China’s attitude toward cross-Strait relations and the Taiwan Strait issue is consistent: It believes that both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to the same China and that the Taiwan Strait issue is an internal Chinese issue, and it strives as much as possible for peaceful reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. However, it will not hesitate to use force to oppose “Taiwan independence” and the intervention of external forces in order to safeguard the country’s territorial integrity and defend national sovereignty, security, and development interests. Mainland China has repeatedly stated that “Taiwan independence” means war."
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","In practice, mainland China has already adopted the Anti-Secession Law, which clearly stipulates the three circumstances under which non-peaceful means and other necessary measures may be used: (1) The “Taiwan independence” secessionist forces act under any name or by any means to cause the fact of Taiwan’s secession from China, (2) major incidents entailing Taiwan’s secession from China occur, or (3) possibilities for a peaceful reunification are completely exhausted. When any one of these three circumstances occurs, mainland China must take non-peaceful and other necessary measures to deal with the Taiwan Strait issue and achieve cross-Strait reunification."
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","After all, achieving complete national reunification and the great rejuvenation of the nation are the two great historical tasks to be accomplished by the middle of this century. Both peaceful and non-peaceful methods are only means for achieving complete national reunification, and they have to be used according to the circumstances."
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","Moreover, China’s overall strength and military power have made significant gains since 1949, especially since the beginning of reform and opening up. It has firmly grasped leadership and the initiative in cross-Strait relations, and is now capable of resolving the Taiwan issue and achieving national reunification under any circumstances."
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","As Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the CCP Central Committee, President of the State and Chairman of the Central Military Commission, pointed out and warned in his speech at a meeting marking the 110th anniversary of the Revolution of 1911, “The Chinese nation has a glorious tradition of opposing secession and preserving unity. The separatist attempt to seek ‘Taiwan independence’ is the biggest obstacle to the unification of the motherland and a serious hidden danger to the rejuvenation of the nation. Those who forget their ancestors, betray the motherland, and split the country will never come to a good end, but will be spurned by the people and judged by history! The issue of Taiwan is purely China’s internal affair, one which brooks no external interference. No one should underestimate the strong determination, firm will, and powerful ability of the Chinese people to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity! The historical task of the complete reunification of the motherland must be achieved, and it definitely can be achieved!”"
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","2. “Taiwan independence” forces, in collusion with external forces, are touching the red line and challenging the bottom line"
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","On May 1, 2021, the British magazine The Economist published a cover article entitled “The Most Dangerous Place on Earth,” which declared that Taiwan is “the most dangerous place in world.” As early as March 2021, Philip Davidson, Commander of the United States Indo-Pacific Command, told the U.S. Congress that mainland China would resolve the Taiwan issue by force as early as 2027."
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","The reason why Davidson made such a statement to Congress was obviously to “cry wolf” in order to ask for a bigger military budget and induce Taiwan to buy more weapons from the United States, as well as to shape public opinion so that the United States will continue its deep involvement in the Taiwan Strait to achieve its strategic objectives. The British media calling Taiwan “the most dangerous place in the world” may be a case of knowing what is true but not knowing why."
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","The fact is, countries and institutions claiming that “peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait are of paramount importance,” and that peace in the Taiwan Strait may change, do so mostly for their own selfish purposes; and they only see Chinese ships and aircraft frequently circling Taiwan and crossing the so-called “median line of the Taiwan Strait,” but deliberately do not explain the reasons for this. Perhaps they are pretending to be confused, and are confusing the public in the hopes of blaming mainland China for the current tensions in the Taiwan Strait!"
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","In fact, the position and claims of mainland China on achieving national reunification have long been clearly stated. That is, “Chinese people do not fight Chinese people,” but the precondition is that the Taiwan side follows the norms of its so-called “Constitution of the Republic of China” with regard to the two sides of the Taiwan Strait belonging to the same China, does not engage in “Taiwan independence” separatist activities, and meets the mainland halfway. In other words, they identify themselves as “Chinese,” do not become “enemies of the Chinese” who split the country and harm national interests, and take measures to promote peaceful reunification across the Taiwan Strait. As is well known, in order to safeguard the core interests of the country in terms of territory, sovereignty, security and development, all necessary means, including non-peaceful means, can be used to deal with enemies who would split the country and harm national interests. This is also the rule followed by the mainstream international community, including the United States."
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","In reality, the main reason why the Taiwan Strait is currently experiencing stormy weather, and Taiwan is becoming “the most dangerous place in the world” and may become like “today’s Ukraine,” is not mainland China’s so-called intention to use force to achieve national reunification, nor is it mainland China’s so-called intention to change the international order to dominate regional affairs in the Asia-Pacific region. Rather, it is the result of Taiwan’s “Taiwan independence” separatist forces and the United States and other international anti-China forces who, in order to achieve their own political and strategic ambitions, are colluding in a vain attempt to change the nature of the two sides of the strait as belonging to the same China, split Taiwan from China, and obstruct the nation’s development and rejuvenation, thus seriously undermining China’s core interests in terms of territory, sovereignty, security, and development."
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","We all know that as mainland China continues to rise under reform and opening up, the gaps between its GDP and overall power and those of the United States are becoming narrower, its participation in international affairs is growing, and its influence in the international community is becoming greater. The United States not only believes that its previous policy of engagement and exchange with China aimed at peaceful evolution has failed, but also that the rise of mainland China is generally detrimental to the United States’ hegemonic strategy and national interests, and it has therefore turned to a policy of strategic competition aimed at curbing, containing, and suppressing China. Beginning with the Trump administration, the United States has intensified its efforts to curb, contain, and suppress mainland China by using various kinds of leverage and conditions— constantly touching the red line in China-U.S. relations, and playing the “Taiwan card” more frequently and with greater intensity, including more advanced arms sales to Taiwan, more high-level official visits to Taiwan, and more frequent ship and aircraft arrivals, in a vain attempt to “use Taiwan to control China.” This constantly gives the wrong signal of supporting “Taiwan independence” separatist forces, but also directly infringes on China’s territory, sovereignty, and security, and endangers the peace and stability of the Taiwan Strait. Mainland China has no choice but to take countermeasures."
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","Meanwhile, the DPP, which came to power on May 20, 2016, has not only unilaterally overturned the “1992 Consensus” previously reached across the Taiwan Strait to maintain the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations, but has also taken advantage of its “full rule” to stir up “Taiwan independence” secessionist activities. It has also taken advantage of the opportunities presented by the United States’ strategic adjustment towards China and playing of the “Taiwan card” to collude with the United States and other international anti-China forces to seek Taiwan’s independence, contain the development of mainland China, and undermine the country’s core interests in terms of territory, sovereignty, security, and development, thereby turning itself into an enemy of China. In view of this, in order to safeguard the country’s core interests in terms of territory, sovereignty, security, and development, mainland China has no choice but to take some necessary measures, including military actions, against the “Taiwan independence” secessionist forces and the hostile actions of external anti-China forces."
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","This is the main reason why Chinese ships and aircraft have frequently circled Taiwan and crossed the so-called “median line of the Taiwan Strait” in recent years, and why Taiwan is becoming the “most dangerous place in the world.” As we all know, in defending the core interests of national territory, sovereignty, security, and development, the will of mainland China is rock-solid, and China has been very consistent. If the United States and other international anti-China forces continue to play the “Taiwan card,” and if “Taiwan independence” secessionist forces continue to engage in “Taiwan independence” secessionist activities, China’s ships and aircraft will continue to frequently circle Taiwan and cross the so-called “median line of the Taiwan Strait.” Moreover, in the event that the international anti-China forces and the “Taiwan independence” separatist forces cross the bottom line that both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to the same China, and if they touch the red line defined by the Anti-Secession Law, they will receive a devastating blow by military force from mainland China. The so-called “today Ukraine, tomorrow Taiwan” will then surely become a reality!"
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022",III. A pawn that is bound to be sacrificed
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","In fact, the DPP and other “Taiwan independence” separatist forces on the island, and the Taiwan authorities, have always been very clear in their own minds about several facts: First, if they want “Taiwan independence” secession, they must face a war in the Taiwan Strait. Second, unless they are sure that they can win, the people of Taiwan will not want a war , and will not support the authorities in power. Third, Taiwan’s own strength cannot resist unification and seek independence, or ensure the security of Taiwan, and it would need the United States-led international anti-China forces to send troops to protect Taiwan. Fourth, the United States-led international anti-China forces will not lightly send troops to protect Taiwan."
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","Therefore, the DPP and other “Taiwan independence” separatist forces and the Taiwan authorities are trying to seize the current opportunity of the United States’ strategic adjustment towards China to “rely on the United States to seek independence.” To this end, the “Taiwan independence” separatist forces and the Taiwan authorities are not only clinging to the United States’ knees, but are also willing to be the pawns and game pieces in the United States’ efforts to curb, contain, and suppress mainland China. Moreover, they are actively sowing discord between China and the United States in an attempt to bring about an early break in China-U.S. relations, while also trying to completely drag down and trap the United States, which is playing the “Taiwan card” out of strategic competition with China, so that it will be forced to send troops to protect Taiwan when the two sides of the Strait meet on the battlefield."
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","So, will the United States send troops to protect Taiwan? At present, the United States is indeed using various kinds of leverage and conditions, including playing the “Taiwan card”, to try to curb, contain, and suppress China’s rise. This presents a possible opportunity to the “Taiwan independence” elements and Taiwan authorities, who have been expecting to receive U.S. support. However, the United States has always practiced international realism and chosen to act based on consideration of its own interests. The United States will weigh how to play the “Taiwan card” and what kind of “Taiwan card” to play based on realism and the pros and cons. When the disadvantages of playing a certain “Taiwan card” outweigh the benefits, the United States will not consider playing it or will stop playing it."
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","How the United States plays the “Taiwan card” in practice depends mainly on a balancing of its strategic competition-based attempts to curb, contain, and suppress China’s rise with its goal of reaping the huge practical benefits that maintaining diplomatic relations with China brings. On one hand, it tries to “use Taiwan to control China” to help achieve its strategic competition objectives, and on the other, it tries to use the method as a bargaining chip to help gain greater actual benefits from the China-U.S. diplomatic relationship. This dictates that the United States will play the “Taiwan card” to the extent that there will be no showdown and no severing of diplomatic relations. Therefore, it will not establish so-called diplomatic relations with Taiwan. This is why the United States, which has implemented a policy of strategic competition with China, has claimed to adhere to the one-China policy from the Trump administration to the Biden administration."
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","As for the claim that the United States would send troops to protect Taiwan, it is even more of a fantasy. A typical manifestation of the U.S. practice of international realism is in considering whether to put warfare means on the agenda. At present, although the China-U.S. differences are hard to reconcile, the power of each side to destroy the other gives the United States, with its pursuit of international realism, no choice but to give up resorting to a direct warfare solution. And today, with the rise of mainland China, international factors such as the United States are no longer the main force in determining whether the two sides of the Taiwan Strait can be unified. As the RAND Corporation and other U.S. think tanks have repeatedly concluded in war games, although China is still unable to match the United States in overall military power, the United States no longer has an advantage in near-shore operations such as in the Taiwan Strait. In fact, if mainland China wants to use force to crack down on the “Taiwan independence” forces and solve the Taiwan issue, even if the United States-led international anti-China forces were to form a coalition to protect Taiwan, it would be to no avail. This is also the fundamental reason why the United States maintains so-called “strategic ambiguity” on the issue of defending Taiwan."
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","In short, the United States and other Western countries practice international realism, and decide how to play the “Taiwan card” based on their own interests. Today, with mainland China rising, Taiwan is not the core interest of these countries, but only their card or pawn. Therefore, these countries will certainly not risk sacrificing the benefits of maintaining diplomatic relations with mainland China or risk sacrificing the lives of their own people to send troops to protect Taiwan. At the most there will only be public opinion condemnation, economic sanctions, diplomatic pressure, and weapons support. Once the Taiwan issue is resolved, it will not be long before these realist countries inevitably face up to and acknowledge the reality, and seek to re-establish good diplomatic relations with China, based on their own interests. Taiwan is thus a pawn that is bound to be sacrificed."
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022",IV. Take Ukraine’s recent example as a warning
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","The Russia-Ukraine conflict has proven that the United States has been using Ukraine as cannon fodder from beginning to end, and Ukraine has foolishly been used as cannon fodder by the United States, leading to the destruction of lives and souls. When Ukraine asked the United States for help, the United States only made public condemnations and put economic sanctions on Russia, but refused to defend Ukraine militarily, and was not about to send troops to protect Ukraine. Instead, it took the opportunity to sell soon-to-be-obsolete weapons and soon-to-expire ammunition to Ukraine and make a fortune off the war, and is attempting to further weaken Russia and divide Europe by prolonging the war. This then is the self-interested, realist United States!"
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","One can further predict that once Ukraine loses its value to the United States, the United States will quickly remove even the current public condemnations and economic sanctions. After all, the United States did not condemn and sanction Russia for the sake of Ukraine’s interests or for the sake of any so-called justice and morality. Moreover, such condemnations and sanctions are actually not conducive to or even detrimental to U.S. national interests."
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","Presumably, the people of Taiwan, the “Taiwan independence” separatist forces, and the Taiwan authorities are watching the self-inflicted tragedy of Ukraine and the manifestation of U.S. realism and self-interest. A new poll released by the Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation on March 22 shows that the Russia-Ukraine conflict has caused more Taiwanese to disbelieve that the U.S. military will help defend Taiwan, with those who believe plummeting to 34 percent from 65 percent six months earlier, a drop of up to 30 percent. The foundation’s chairman, Ying-lung You, said the percentage of Taiwanese who believe the U.S. military will assist their defense plummeted 30.5 percentage points in just six months, while those who believe the U.S. military is unlikely to assist in defense shot up 27.4 percentage points. This is an extremely unusual shift in collective attitudes. It fully demonstrates that the experience of Ukraine fighting alone has had a huge impact on Taiwan’s hearts and minds, and can be dubbed the “Ukraine Situation Effect.” According to the poll, as many as 60% of Taiwanese people are worried about Taiwan becoming “a second Ukraine.” The Russia-Ukraine conflict is still ongoing, but the poll shows that most of Taiwan’s people have shifted from having confidence in the United States sending troops to defend Taiwan to a collapse of confidence. A big shift in Taiwan’s collective attitude was expected. It is just that the “Taiwan independence” forces are not willing or inclined to face it."
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","As mentioned earlier, the “Taiwan independence” separatist forces know that it is impossible to achieve a “Taiwan independence” secession attempt by Taiwan’s own strength, and they have to rely on the support of external forces led by the United States. In particular, they need external forces led by the United States to send troops to protect Taiwan in order to assure that Taiwan will be able to split from China peacefully."
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","However, the United States and other Western countries have always practiced international realism and will decide whether to support “Taiwan independence” secession by weighing the pros and cons of doing so. In particular, when it comes to sending troops to protect Taiwan or not, they will evaluate the strength of the military power that China and the United States can put into the Taiwan Strait."
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","In the face of mainland China’s rise, the relationship of interdependent interests formed between China and the United States in the course of globalization, and the contrast between the military power that China and the United States can project in the Taiwan Strait, the United States will have no choice but to adhere to its “one-China policy” in order to maintain diplomatic relations with mainland China, and will have to maintain its “strategic ambiguity” toward Taiwan, not daring to explicitly commit to sending troops to protect Taiwan."
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","To sum up, Taiwan should note that mainland China has the will, determination, and ability to oppose “Taiwan independence” secession and achieve national reunification. It should note that mainland China has a firm bottom line, that secession will definitely bring war, that the United States (and other external forces) cannot be relied on at all, and that “Taiwan independence” is impossible to achieve."
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","In fact, the mainland authorities and people have repeatedly issued a stern warning: “Taiwan independence” is a dead end, and “Taiwan independence” means war. The “Taiwan independence” separatist forces who are colluding with external forces and trying to “rely on the United States to seek independence” should be careful, as the example of today’s tragic situation in Ukraine is close at hand. I personally think that this is the very moment in which Taiwan should learn the many obvious lessons from the evolution of the Russia-Ukraine situation. The sensible course is to pull back from the precipice, stay far away from the blind alley of “Taiwan independence,” and turn to the right path of reunification."
What Can Taiwan Learn from the Evolution of the Russia-Ukraine Situation?,"China Review , Tang Yonghong","Jun 4, 2022","In particular, the general public in Taiwan should recognize the historical trend, choose to stand on the “right side of history,” and work with the people of the mainland to “accomplish the glorious task of the complete reunification of the motherland and the great rejuvenation of the nation.” After all, in an era of cross-Strait confrontation between unification and independence, in an era of strategic competition between China and the United States, and in particular in the context of the “Taiwan independence” separatist forces engaging in secessionist activities, which have made the Taiwan Strait a place of storms and the dangers of war, and of international anti-China forces with their Cold War mentality trying to curb, contain, and suppress China’s rise, whether to pursue unification or attempt secession, and whether to promote national rejuvenation or hinder it—these are questions of great right and wrong, in which one’s own destiny and well-being are at stake."
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,"Leadership Essays , Xi Jinping","Mar 2, 1993","The key to implementing the spirit of the Party’s 14th National Congress, accelerating economic construction, and deepening reform and opening up lies in leadership. As for how to excel in leadership in the new situation, leading cadres at the grass-roots level have raised many questions. Recently, we brought these questions before Comrade Xi Jinping, Secretary of the Fuzhou Municipal Party Committee."
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,"Leadership Essays , Xi Jinping","Mar 2, 1993","Question: In your opinion, what new leadership concepts should be established in a socialist market economic system? What old leadership concepts and methods should be changed?"
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,"Leadership Essays , Xi Jinping","Mar 2, 1993","A: To excel in the grand socialist market economy, for leading cadres at all levels, it is not only necessary to deeply understand the great significance of developing a socialist market economy, but also to reform ideas, earnestly grasp the operating laws and requirements of the socialist market economy, deeply understand and familiarize oneself with the market, and constantly enhance market awareness. This specifically includes establishing the concept of market-oriented decision-making, daring to be the first in the world, daring to break past old rules and regulations, and daring to tear down barriers. We must establish the concept of talent-based competition, boldly select, actively cultivate, and strive to introduce all kinds of talents who have both ability and political integrity and who have the courage and knowledge to adapt to the needs of market economic development. We must also establish and strengthen new leadership concepts, break through the shackles of backward traditional concepts and subjective prejudices, and change old leadership concepts and styles of leadership. This mainly means breaking past the misconception that the development of the commodity economy and the market economy be regarded as “deviant” and thereby further emancipating minds."
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,"Leadership Essays , Xi Jinping","Mar 2, 1993","In terms of leadership, it is necessary to break through administrative monopolies, decentralize power to the market and enterprises, abandon “power interception,” and “release the waters to attract more fish,” which is the primary task of establishing a market economic system. To this end, our leaders must liberate themselves from the old executive orders and the awareness of superiors, let enterprises “play the leading role” in the market economy, focus government functions on macro-control, formulate market economic rules, promote fair competition, solve problems for enterprises, and guide the healthy development of the economy."
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,"Leadership Essays , Xi Jinping","Mar 2, 1993",Q: What should be the most important qualities of a leader in this new situation?
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,"Leadership Essays , Xi Jinping","Mar 2, 1993","A: I think that under the new situation of reform and opening up, in addition to requiring leaders to have the basic qualities of emancipating their minds and seeking truth from facts, the most important thing is to be creative. Only creative leaders can excel at leading reforms, promoting reforms, and making work dynamic, vigorous, enterprising, and effective."
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,"Leadership Essays , Xi Jinping","Mar 2, 1993","To be creative, we must first establish firm beliefs. If a leader is bewildered by the temporary low tide of the international communist movement and loses confidence in building a strong socialist country with Chinese characteristics with pessimism and disappointment, what kind of creativity is there? Second, you must be courageous and knowledgeable. In the tide of reform and opening up, a leader must be filled with the spirit of “breakthrough,” must dare to experiment, dare to break through boldly, and dare to blaze new paths and begin new careers. This is manifested in work that is instilled with a strong sense of progress and leaders that excel at grasping opportunities, possess unique insights, and have the sensitivity to understand the situation and predict prospects. It is manifested in leaders that dare to think and do the work, grasp it accurately, securely, and practically, and are able to achieve outstanding work performance on this difficult and tortuous road. Third, we must master the “two ends.” The first is orders from above. Leaders must have a profound understanding of the guidelines, lines, and policies of the central and provincial party committees. The second is the lay of the land. Leaders must accurately understand the actual situation of the region, the local government, and the will of the masses. Only by organically combining the two can we work creatively in practice."
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,"Leadership Essays , Xi Jinping","Mar 2, 1993","Q: In accelerating reform, opening up, and modernization, what is the most important aspect of making good leadership decisions?"
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,"Leadership Essays , Xi Jinping","Mar 2, 1993","A: To make leadership decisions, first of all, we must adhere to the scientific nature of decision-making, act in accordance with the objective laws of social and economic development, be truth-seeking and pragmatic, and proceed from reality. This is the most important aspect of current leadership decision-making. In the process of reform, opening up, and modernization, due to the different conditions in different places, development has not been balanced. This requires us to proceed from local realities, to adhere to a positive and realistic attitude, and to constantly grasp the changing economic development conditions and trends. We must seize every opportunity to promote and advance the extraordinary and high-speed development of the economy."
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,"Leadership Essays , Xi Jinping","Mar 2, 1993","Second, we must adhere to the democratic nature of decision-making. The essence of socialist leadership is to seek the interests of the broad masses of the people. Therefore, leaders must always take the idea of seeking benefits for the people and keeping in close contact with the masses as the fundamental ideology of decision-making. This requires us to implement broad democracy in decision-making, to adhere to the ideological line of coming from the masses and going to the masses, to listen carefully to the opinions of the masses, and to excel at concentrating the wisdom of the masses. During the years I worked in Fuzhou, I gradually formed a set of effective working methods: The first was to carry out large-scale city-wide work methodology research activities for three consecutive years, allowing cadres and the masses to review the implementation of various work and practical affairs of the municipal party committee and government in the previous year and to put forward work suggestions for the new year. The second was to carry out on-site office meeting activities at the grassroots level to keep abreast of the real situation of the counties (cities), districts, and departments and to help resolve practical problems in a timely manner at the grassroots level. The third was to carry out the activities of leading cadres to jointly visit the masses. The leaders gained direct face-to-face, heart-to-heart experiences with the masses to exchange ideas, listen to the voices of the masses, understand the sufferings of the masses, and resolve the problems of the masses in a timely manner."
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,"Leadership Essays , Xi Jinping","Mar 2, 1993","Q: In the current situation where there is much work to be done, what should be the most important work for leaders?"
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,"Leadership Essays , Xi Jinping","Mar 2, 1993","A: The tasks before us are indeed burdensome and arduous. In this case, I believe that leaders must be good at seeing the big picture. Rather than trying to attend to big and small matters as one who grasps the eyebrows and the beard all at once, in order to think about, plan, and seize big things, a leader’s main energy must be devoted to the overall, directional, and key issues. In recent years, our municipal party committee has paid more attention to getting rid of the entanglement of affairs, focusing on the overall situation, concentrating on and doing a good job of some major events that can affect and drive the overall situation, thereby winning the initiative in our work. For example, in this past period, we organized a special team to study and formulate the Strategic Vision for Fuzhou City’s 20-Year Economic and Social Development. The strategic goals, priorities, and measures for the future development of our city were put forward, formulating a programmatic document to guide the city’s work. Under the strategic guidance of the city’s economic and social development, the key to developing an export-oriented economy is to do a good job in attracting investment, play our “cards” and “billiards,” and continuously expand the scale and field of foreign capital utilization. Adjust the economic structure, mainly to optimize primary industries, adjust secondary industries, vigorously develop tertiary industries, and promote the rapid and healthy development of the national economy. In urban construction, we must focus on the renovation of old cities and create a good social environment for reform and opening up. Because of clear goals and a prominent focus, positive factors were effectively mobilized in all aspects, forming an absolute advantage in solving problems as a whole."
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,"Leadership Essays , Xi Jinping","Mar 2, 1993",Q: Fuzhou has made remarkable achievements in the renovation of the old city. What has been the overall experience in terms of leadership?
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,"Leadership Essays , Xi Jinping","Mar 2, 1993","A: Since the reform and opening up, especially in recent years, Fuzhou has carried out multi-channel, multi-form, and multi-level renovation of the old city, already renovating more than half of the area. This has greatly improved the urban investment environment and the living conditions of citizens, both of which are remarkable results. From the perspective of leadership decision-making, the key has been to seize the great opportunity of reform and opening up to give full play to the role of Fuzhou as a capital city, a central city, and a historical and cultural city, using the geographical advantage of being close to Hong Kong and Taiwan to emancipate the mind. This boldly and decisively combines the urgent desire of the general public to improve our living environment with the requirements of the times to transform, build, and beautify the city, so that they complement each other and achieve the best of both worlds. Specifically, there are the following four aspects. The first is to strengthen leadership and unify planning. The renovation of the old city should be listed as an important task in economic construction, and we should work closely with one another to strengthen the organization, planning, policies, and management so that the renovation of the old city can develop in a comprehensive, complete, and healthy way. The second is to emancipate the mind and actively explore. We must boldly innovate, dare to venture, dare to take risks, dare to try, and take an unconventional and leaping development path so that the transformation of the old city will continue to develop in depth and breadth. The third is to introduce foreign capital to advance and formulate preferential policies to encourage foreign businessmen to participate in the renovation of the old city. Currently, our foreign participation rate is over 50%. The fourth is to believe in the masses and rely on the masses, firmly establish a sense of responsibility and mission for the benefit of the people, follow the path of the masses, consider and take care of the legitimate interests of the masses, and gain the care, understanding, support, and participation of the masses, so that the renovation of the old city can proceed smoothly."
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,"Leadership Essays , Xi Jinping","Mar 2, 1993",Q: How can young leading cadres do their jobs well under the new situation?
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,"Leadership Essays , Xi Jinping","Mar 2, 1993","A: The new situation of reform and opening up has put forward new tasks and new requirements for young leading cadres. In order to adapt to such a situation and successfully complete the work assigned by the Party and the people, we must pay attention to the following relationships:"
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,"Leadership Essays , Xi Jinping","Mar 2, 1993","The first is the relationship between heritage and innovation. The development of the economy and culture is a matter of heritage. Young leading cadres should not deny or abandon the achievements of their predecessors, but should rather humbly learn from their elder comrades, constantly enrich and improve themselves, and continue to develop on this basis, making innovations within this heritage, spur reform and opening up and economic construction to a new stage in innovation, and enhance leadership ability in innovation. Only in this way can the continuity and stability of leadership work be maintained."
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,"Leadership Essays , Xi Jinping","Mar 2, 1993","The second is the relationship between power and duty. In particular, young leading cadres should establish the idea that “leadership is service” and strengthen their awareness of public servants. It should be clearly recognized that the power of leaders is endowed by the Party and the people and can only be used for the people rather than for personal gain. Become a leader with “great power that does not forget the heavy responsibility and respect and that does not forget one’s core of public servitude,” unite power with responsibility and service, and maintain and utilize power well to serve the people."
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,"Leadership Essays , Xi Jinping","Mar 2, 1993","The third is to adhere to the relationship between collective leadership and daring to be responsible. With the deepening of reform and opening up, the tasks faced are becoming more and more arduous, and the situation is becoming more and more complicated. The knowledge and ability of leaders alone cannot resolve these issues. We must concentrate everyone’s wisdom, work together, and succeed. This requires young leading cadres to conscientiously adhere to and improve the collective leadership system, establish and implement a scientific division of labor and responsibility, give full play to the role of each and every team member, and prevent individuals from having the final say. At the same time, young leading cadres must have the spirit of being highly responsible to the Party and the people, and at the critical moment when they must make decisions, they must stand up, have the courage to take responsibility, and dare to make decisions."
