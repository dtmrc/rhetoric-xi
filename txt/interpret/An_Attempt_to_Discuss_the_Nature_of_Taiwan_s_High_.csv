An Attempt to Discuss the Nature of Taiwan’s High Degree of Autonomy After Peaceful Reunification: Based on the Practical Experience of Hong Kong,"Taiwan Studies , Wu Libin ","Feb 20, 2022","“Peaceful reunification and One Country, Two Systems” are the fundamental principles of the mainland’s policy towards Taiwan. General Secretary Xi Jinping proposed exploring a “One Country, Two Systems” formula for Taiwan (“一国两制”台湾方案) in his speech on the 40th anniversary of the publication of the Message to Compatriots in Taiwan. According to the conception of the mainland’s “One Country, Two Systems” principle, Taiwan will enjoy a high degree of autonomy after the peaceful reunification of the two sides of the Strait. 1 Judging from the practice of the “One Country, Two Systems” policy in Hong Kong, the institutional design centered around this high degree of autonomy is undoubtedly a top priority of the Taiwan formula. In order to construct a complete and sound institutional design, a fundamental question that must be answered is this: what is the nature of the autonomy of post-peaceful-reunification Taiwan’s high degree of autonomy? The different answers to this question will directly affect the power relations between the central government and Taiwan after the peaceful reunification of the two sides of the Strait, and directly affect the scope and extent to which the central government can govern Taiwan."

Some scholars have formed two different viewpoints in their discussions of the nature of the autonomy enjoyed by Taiwan after peaceful reunification: delegated autonomy (授权性自治权说) and shared-power autonomy (分权性自治权说) [translator’s note: the latter can also be translated as ‘separation-of-powers autonomy’]."

An Attempt to Discuss the Nature of Taiwan’s High Degree of Autonomy After Peaceful Reunification: Based on the Practical Experience of Hong Kong,"Taiwan Studies , Wu Libin ","Feb 20, 2022","Mainland scholars seldom explicitly state that the autonomy enjoyed by Taiwan after peaceful reunification will be of the nature of delegated autonomy, but it can be inferred from the relevant discussions that a group of scholars holds the view that Taiwan will enjoy delegated autonomy after peaceful reunification. Most of the institutional design and thinking on the “One Country, Two Systems” model for Taiwan do not deviate from the prototype of the Hong Kong and Macao model, except in that Taiwan enjoys a higher degree of autonomy or administrative status. 2 For example, Yu Keli pointed out that “our policy to solve the Taiwan issue can be more relaxed than the policy to resolve the Hong Kong issue, and the Taiwan model of ‘One Country, Two Systems’ should be better than today’s Hong Kong model.” 3 Su Ge pointed out that “after the peaceful reunification of Taiwan and the mainland of the motherland, Taiwan compatriots will not only enjoy all the political rights and interests provided by the Hong Kong and Macao model, but Taiwanese people can also come to the mainland of the motherland to assume leadership positions in national political institutions.” 4 Wang Weixing also pointed out that “under the conditions of ‘One Country, Two Systems,’ although Taiwan is essentially a local government in a unitary state structure, its authority will be greater than that of the provinces on the mainland of the motherland, as well as the authority of the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions.” 5 According to this reasoning, the specific form of implementation of “One Country, Two Systems” in Taiwan is an upgraded or expanded version of the Hong Kong and Macao model, which is a “quantitative” rather than a “qualitative” difference. The autonomy enjoyed by Taiwan, like the autonomy of Hong Kong and Macao, is still a delegated autonomy."

However, this conception positions Taiwan within the structural form of a unitary system. 7 In other words, the autonomy enjoyed by Taiwan after peaceful reunification would be a delegated autonomy."

It has some special powers, and even some of the powers of the central government, but its special powers are delegated to it by the central government. … The central government has the highest sovereignty and jurisdiction over the whole of China, while the Taiwan authorities’ jurisdiction over Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, Matsu, and their affiliated islands is delegated by the central government. This is a temporary and limited jurisdiction and must not endanger national sovereignty, security, and development interests.” 8"

An Attempt to Discuss the Nature of Taiwan’s High Degree of Autonomy After Peaceful Reunification: Based on the Practical Experience of Hong Kong,"Taiwan Studies , Wu Libin ","Feb 20, 2022","Wang Liping, a professor at Peking University, had early on put forward a different view on the delegated autonomy to be enjoyed by post-reunification Taiwan. She pointed out that: “the two systems in ‘One Country, Two Systems’ can also refer to a unitary system and a federal system. As long as there is the practical and theoretical possibility, the principles of ‘One Country, Two Systems’ and ‘one China’ do not exclude the realization of national unity through federalism. … In their research on ‘One Country, Two Systems,’ some scholars are often eager to draw a clear dividing line between ‘One Country, Two Systems’ and federalism, and even hastily dismiss federalism. On the one hand, this reflects a misunderstanding of federalism, and on the other hand, it stems from rigid thinking on the form of state structures.” 9 According to Wang Liping’s point of view, the possibility that post-reunification Taiwan could enjoy shared-power autonomy cannot be ruled out."
An Attempt to Discuss the Nature of Taiwan’s High Degree of Autonomy After Peaceful Reunification: Based on the Practical Experience of Hong Kong,"Taiwan Studies , Wu Libin ","Feb 20, 2022","Professor Wang Yingjin of Renmin University of China may have been the first scholar to explicitly propose the idea of shared-power autonomy. He proposed: “acknowledge or recognize that the power that Taiwan is currently holding and exercising is original power (本源性权力) (that is, the right to exercise sovereignty) inherent in its 23 million people. On this basis, through negotiation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, the Taiwan side hands over to the central government that part of its right to exercise sovereignty which can reflect national unity (such as diplomatic power). The remaining part that has not been handed over will be retained by the Taiwan side as ‘residual power.’ In other words, the ‘sharing of powers’ is implemented between the central government and Taiwan at the level of original power, rather than the ‘delegation of power’ by the central government to Taiwan at the level of derivative power. That is, through some legal method, letting Taiwan enjoy shared-power autonomy rather than the delegated autonomy enjoyed by Hong Kong and Macao. After the principle of federal separation of powers is implemented between the central government and the Taiwan Special Administrative Region, the relationship between the central government and the Taiwan Special Administrative Region will no longer be a central-local relationship in the general sense, nor a relationship between a center and another center in the sense of the federation as a whole and its member units, but a relationship between a center and a ‘quasi-center’.” 10"
An Attempt to Discuss the Nature of Taiwan’s High Degree of Autonomy After Peaceful Reunification: Based on the Practical Experience of Hong Kong,"Taiwan Studies , Wu Libin ","Feb 20, 2022","In the book The Taiwan Model of “One Country, Two Systems,” Professor Li Yihu of Peking University and other scholars pointed out that: “it is undoubtedly wrong to simply regard the Taiwan model of ‘One Country, Two Systems’ as an expanded version of the Hong Kong and Macao model of ‘One Country, Two Systems’.” 11 The book further argues that, “under the Hong Kong and Macao model of ‘One Country, Two Systems,’ although the two special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macao have a high degree of autonomy, even higher than the powers possessed by member units in some federal countries, this is only a difference of degree, not of nature. In terms of fundamental nature, the relationship of Hong Kong and Macao with the central government is still within the framework of a unitary system. The amount of power granted by the central government to a special administrative region is entirely at the discretion of the central government, and the central government is fully able to change the power of the special administrative region through unilateral constitutional amendments or legislation, or even to completely change the special administrative region’s system.” “Concerns and fears about this possibility are precisely the root cause of Taiwan resistance to the Hong Kong and Macao model of ‘One Country, Two Systems’ and its expanded version.” “The Taiwan model of ‘One Country, Two Systems’ will inevitably introduce some features of federalism.” 12 It can be seen that the above thesis does not accept the view that the autonomy enjoyed by Taiwan after peaceful reunification is a delegated autonomy, but holds that this kind of autonomy should by nature be a shared-power autonomy."
An Attempt to Discuss the Nature of Taiwan’s High Degree of Autonomy After Peaceful Reunification: Based on the Practical Experience of Hong Kong,"Taiwan Studies , Wu Libin ","Feb 20, 2022","Lin Gang, a professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, holds a similar view. He believes that: “the power relationship between the central government and the Hong Kong and Macao SAR governments is a derivative delegation of power. Meanwhile, according to the Taiwan model of ‘One Country, Two Systems,’ after reunification, Taiwan will enjoy executive power, legislative power, judicial power, and the power of final judicial adjudication, with a certain coloring of federalism. In the relationship between the central government and the sub-central government (system and sub-system), it is a sharing of original power, rather than the derivative delegation of power. … Taiwan enjoys shared-power autonomy, not delegated autonomy.” 13"
An Attempt to Discuss the Nature of Taiwan’s High Degree of Autonomy After Peaceful Reunification: Based on the Practical Experience of Hong Kong,"Taiwan Studies , Wu Libin ","Feb 20, 2022","In short, the two different viewpoints presented above can be summarized as: with regard to the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula, if the autonomy enjoyed by Taiwan is a delegated autonomy, then the central government and Taiwan are in a relationship of delegator and delegatee. If this autonomy is shared-power autonomy, then the central government and Taiwan are in a separation of powers relationship. The fundamental difference between the two is: in the relationship between delegator and delegatee, the power of the central government is inherent, original, and can be said to be unlimited, and the power of the locality is derived, originates from the delegation of power by the central government, and is limited, with the “residual power” belonging to the central government. A separation of powers relationship is the opposite. Local power is inherent, original, and unlimited. The central government’s power comes from the transfer of local power and is limited, with the “residual power” belonging to the locality. 14"

An Attempt to Discuss the Nature of Taiwan’s High Degree of Autonomy After Peaceful Reunification: Based on the Practical Experience of Hong Kong,"Taiwan Studies , Wu Libin ","Feb 20, 2022","It is unrealistic to enumerate the allocation of central and local powers in a single law. Among the reasons for this is that law itself can, by nature, lag behind whereas practice develops, and as practice develops new power allocations are needed. The fundamental difference between the impact of delegated autonomy and that of shared-power autonomy on central power is: due to the development of practice, when local governments face new situations and legal provisions are unclear or lacking, does the central government have the power to intervene? In short, does the “residual power” belong to the central or the local government? According to the two different theories presented above, if the autonomy enjoyed by the locality is delegated autonomy, then the central government certainly has the right to intervene because the “residual power” belongs to the center. However, if the autonomy enjoyed by the locality is shared-power autonomy, then the center has no power to intervene because the “residual power” belongs to the locality. Then, when the “One Country, Two Systems” policy faces special or emergency situations in the process of its practice in Taiwan, and the legal provisions are unclear or lacking, should the central government’s right to intervene be retained? Here, we may first examine the situation of the practice of the “One Country, Two Systems” policy in Hong Kong."

An Attempt to Discuss the Nature of Taiwan’s High Degree of Autonomy After Peaceful Reunification: Based on the Practical Experience of Hong Kong,"Taiwan Studies , Wu Libin ","Feb 20, 2022","The Hong Kong Basic Law is essentially a law of power delegation. 15 Article 2 of the law clearly states: “The National People’s Congress authorizes the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to exercise a high degree of autonomy and enjoy executive, legislative and independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication, in accordance with the provisions of this Law.” The National People’s Congress is the highest institution of state power, and Article 2 of the Basic Law fully expresses that Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy derives from the delegation of power by the highest institution of state power. This is power delegated by the central government, derivative power, rather than original power."
An Attempt to Discuss the Nature of Taiwan’s High Degree of Autonomy After Peaceful Reunification: Based on the Practical Experience of Hong Kong,"Taiwan Studies , Wu Libin ","Feb 20, 2022","Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy does not alter China’s unitary state structure. 16 China is a unitary state. This is reflected in Article 3, paragraph 4 of the Constitution, which stipulates: “The division of functions and powers between the central and local state organs is guided by the principle of giving full scope to the initiative and enthusiasm of the local authorities under the unified leadership of the central authorities.” At the same time, “local state organs” should include the state institutions of special administrative regions. 17 Moreover, Article 12 of the Hong Kong Basic Law provides that: “The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is a local administrative region of the People’s Republic of China that enjoys a high degree of autonomy and is directly under the Central People’s Government.” It can be seen that Article 12 of the Basic Law and Article 3, paragraph 4 of the Constitution belong consistently to the same line. The central government and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, which is a local administrative region, are in a central-local relationship. Although the high degree of autonomy which Hong Kong has obtained is greater than the autonomy enjoyed by a federal state, this does not change the form of China’s unitary state structure."

Moreover, every time, fortunately, there was the timely intervention of the central government. It was only this that could bring order to the chaos and put things right.

An Attempt to Discuss the Nature of Taiwan’s High Degree of Autonomy After Peaceful Reunification: Based on the Practical Experience of Hong Kong,"Taiwan Studies , Wu Libin ","Feb 20, 2022","As early as 1984, when Deng Xiaoping met with a group of Hong Kong and Macao compatriots attending National Day celebrations, he pointed out: “We can’t worry in a general way about intervention; some intervention is necessary. We must look at whether these interventions are beneficial to the interests of the people of Hong Kong, to the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, or whether they harm the interests of the people of Hong Kong and the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. … But do not think that there are no destructive forces. Such destructive forces may come from this side or that side. If unrest occurs, the central government will be required to intervene. If it turns chaos into order, should such an intervention be welcomed or rejected? It should be welcomed.” 18 In 1987, when Deng Xiaoping met with members of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Basic Law Drafting Committee, he re-emphasized this point: “Don’t ever think that if all Hong Kong’s affairs are administered by the people of Hong Kong while the central government handles nothing at all, all will be well. This would not work—the idea is not realistic. It is true that the center does not intervene in the specific affairs of the special administrative region, nor does it need to intervene. However, will there not be situations in the special administrative region that endanger the fundamental interests of the country? Can we be sure this will not happen? At such a time, should Beijing get involved or not? Is it conceivable that nothing will happen in Hong Kong that harms the fundamental interests of Hong Kong? Can we imagine that there will be no interference and no destructive forces in Hong Kong? I see no basis for such self-comfort. If the center were to abandon any and every power, this could give rise to some confusion and damage Hong Kong’s interests. Therefore, it is in the interests of Hong Kong that the center maintain certain powers.” 19 During the drafting stage of the Hong Kong Basic Law, drafting committee member Martin Lee Chu-ming and others proposed to expressly stipulate in the Basic Law that the powers exercised by the center and the powers other than those enjoyed by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, namely the “residual powers,” should be assigned to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. 20 This kind of opinion essentially advocates that Hong Kong should enjoy “shared-power autonomy,” but the Basic Law did not adopt this view."

The Struggle for Leadership over Hong Kong’s Political System Development. Political system development is also known as political reform. The Hong Kong Basic Law stipulates the goal of achieving “dual universal suffrage” in the election of the Chief Executive and the Legislative Council. Article 45, paragraph 2, stipulates: “The method for selecting the Chief Executive shall be specified in light of the actual situation in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and in accordance with the principle of gradual and orderly progress. The ultimate aim is the selection of the Chief Executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures.” Article 68, paragraph 2 stipulates: “The method for forming the Legislative Council shall be specified in light of the actual situation in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and in accordance with the principle of gradual and orderly progress.

Every time there is an election, it is certain to become the central issue hyped by various political forces in society. 21 After the return of Hong Kong, the SAR government has three times proposed a political reform plan. It has twice been rejected due to obstruction by the opposition in the Legislative Council. 22 The Hong Kong opposition is particularly dissatisfied with Article 45, paragraph 2 of the Basic Law regarding nominations by the nominating committee, and further proposed that nominations should be made directly by voters or by political parties. In December 2013, the Hong Kong SAR government launched a consultation on the third political reform, but met resistance from the radical opposition. With the encouragement of Benny Tai Yiu-ting and others, this ultimately evolved into the 79-day illegal “Occupy Central” movement, paralyzing traffic in the central district of Hong Kong, closing shops, and causing serious economic losses."
An Attempt to Discuss the Nature of Taiwan’s High Degree of Autonomy After Peaceful Reunification: Based on the Practical Experience of Hong Kong,"Taiwan Studies , Wu Libin ","Feb 20, 2022","The essence of the controversy over Hong Kong political reform is the dispute over the authority to govern Hong Kong. Radical opposition forces go beyond the high degree of autonomy stipulated in the Hong Kong Basic Law and try to obstruct and oppose patriots who love the country and love Hong Kong from taking up the post of Chief Executive and administering according to the law. They try to turn the Legislative Council into a base for opposition against the leadership of the executive. They even advocate Hong Kong independence, ultimately targeting the center and its authority to govern Hong Kong. 23 Faced with the actions of the opposition to seize power, the SAR government was no longer able to cope on its own. At that time, the central government had no choice but to intervene; and it had to intervene. In April 2004, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress passed the Interpretation by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress Regarding Annex I (7) and Annex II (III) to the ‘Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China,’ which stipulated that Hong Kong’s political reform must go through a “five-step process”: The Chief Executive submits a report to the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on whether amendments are required–The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress makes a decision–The SAR Government proposes an amendment bill to the Legislative Council and the bill is approved through a two-thirds majority of all members of the Legislative Council–The Chief Executive gives consent–The bill is approved or filed by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress. After that, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress successively passed the Decision of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on Issues Relating to the Methods for Selecting the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in 2007 and for Forming the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in 2008, the Decision of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on Issues Relating to the Methods for Selecting the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and for Forming the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the Year 2012 and On Issues Relating to Universal Suffrage, and the Decision of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on Issues Relating to the Selection of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region by Universal Suffrage and on the Method for Forming the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the Year 2016 to firmly take leadership authority over Hong Kong’s political reform."

In 2020, Benny Tai Yiu-ting and others insisted on conducting illegal “primary elections,” launched the Legislative Council “35-plus plan,” and set out the “10 steps to laam chau” (真揽炒十步) [“laam chau” is a Cantonese term used to mean “to frustrate”], in an attempt to manipulate the election under the pretext of so-called “public opinion” and seize the authority to govern Hong Kong. In the face of the opposition’s counterattack, the center decisively intervened again: on March 11, 2021, the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth National People’s Congress passed the Decision on Improving the Electoral System of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, which directly reformed the Hong Kong electoral system. On March 30, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress revised the Hong Kong Basic Law, Annex I – Method for the Selection of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Hong Kong Basic Law, Annex II – Method for the Formation of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Its Voting Procedures."

On the one hand, the practices after Hong Kong’s return show symptoms and indications that the operation of Hong Kong’s political system has deviated from, or even damaged the fundamental purpose of, “One Country, Two Systems.” In particular, the anti-China forces for chaos in Hong Kong used loopholes in the electoral system to enter Hong Kong’s government institutions, posing a major and real threat to national sovereignty, security, and development interests.24 On the other hand, the protracted political reform controversy in Hong Kong has become a drain on the energy of the SAR government, and even made it difficult for it to focus on the more urgent issues related to economic development, society and people’s wellbeing. Therefore, only when the central government promptly exercised power, 25 intervened appropriately, and revised and improved Hong Kong’s electoral system, could the practice of “One Country, Two Systems” be brought back to the correct track."

Since then, due to obstruction by the opposition and the interference of external forces, Hong Kong has so far failed to complete local legislation on national security. The huge loopholes in Hong Kong’s legal system for safeguarding national security and major flaws in its enforcement mechanisms allowed anti-China forces for chaos in Hong Kong and external forces to flagrantly collude with each other and allowed external forces to interfere in Hong Kong affairs at will, seriously undermining the social stability of Hong Kong and the practice of “One Country, Two Systems.”"

Therefore, in a situation wherein it was difficult to predict when Hong Kong might complete local legislation on national security, it was imperative and was the only option that the legal system and enforcement mechanisms for Hong Kong to safeguard national security be established and improved at the national level.

Looking at the practical experience of Hong Kong, we can imagine that if the autonomy enjoyed by Hong Kong were to have been shared-power autonomy, the power of the center would be limited to a few items explicitly listed in the Hong Kong Basic Law, and at times when new situations arose in Hong Kong which the SAR government could not deal with or resolve by itself, the center would have no right to intervene. The consequences would not only damage Hong Kong’s own prosperity and stability, but also have a negative impact on national sovereignty, security, and development interests."

This left room for the center to appropriately intervene and ensured that the practice of the “One Country, Two Systems” policy in Hong Kong would always stay on the correct course, without deviation or distortion."

The “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula cannot be blindly copied from the Hong Kong formula. The “One Country, Two Systems” policy was proposed to solve the Taiwan issue, but it was first put into practice in Hong Kong. This reflects the nature of the practice in Hong Kong as a “test field.” Comrade Deng Xiaoping once pointed out: “Whether the reunification of the mainland and Taiwan can truly be smoothly achieved depends first on the result of the realization of ‘One Country, Two Systems’ in Hong Kong, and second on whether our economy can truly develop. The key for China to solve all its problems is that it must rely on its own development.” 32 Therefore, the practical experience of “One Country, Two Systems” in Hong Kong should serve as an important reference for the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula."
An Attempt to Discuss the Nature of Taiwan’s High Degree of Autonomy After Peaceful Reunification: Based on the Practical Experience of Hong Kong,"Taiwan Studies , Wu Libin ","Feb 20, 2022","The Taiwan issue and cross-strait reunification are no less complicated than the return of Hong Kong to the motherland. Observing things from the perspective of the current social sentiment and public opinion on the island of Taiwan, the “Taiwan independence” separatist forces have long been tilling the soil in Taiwanese society. Public opinion on the island is deeply influenced by the separatist ideology of “Taiwan independence,” “One Country, Two Systems” has long been stigmatized in Taiwan, and Taiwanese society is quite resistant to “One Country, Two Systems.” Relatively speaking, “Hong Kong independence” has not risen to the same level of popularity in Hong Kong society, and the “One Country, Two Systems” policy is generally accepted by the people of Hong Kong. Moreover, what is fairly certain is that, after the peaceful reunification of the two sides of the Strait, the “Taiwan independence” forces will not automatically retreat, the consciousness of “Taiwan independence” will not automatically disappear, external forces will not give up on interfering in Taiwan’s affairs, and other unforeseen new developments may occur. From this, it can be further inferred that the comprehensive and accurate implementation of the “One Country, Two Systems” policy in Taiwan will face a greater number of more complicated and thorny issues than in Hong Kong. For example, how can we dissolve the “Taiwan independence” forces and eliminate the influence of “Taiwan independence” consciousness as quickly as possible? How can we form mainstream public opinion in favor of and supportive of the “One Country, Two Systems” policy as quickly as possible? How can we ensure that the authority to govern Taiwan does not fall into the hands of “Taiwan independence” elements? How can we improve Taiwan compatriots’ national identification with China? And how can we effectively prevent and constrain external forces from interfering in Taiwan affairs? This series of foreseeable problems along with some unforeseeable ones demand that the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula carries out a more finely detailed, more prudent institutional design regarding the power allocation model between the center and Taiwan. While establishing Taiwan’s high degree of autonomy, it must retain flexible space for central power."

This lack of flexibility could result in a situation where Taiwan desperately needs intervention from the center, but the center has no right to intervene. The young scholar Mao Qimeng has raised doubts and concerns about the theory of shared-power autonomy, pointing out: “With regard to the cross-strait political arrangement under the special circumstances pertaining before national reunification or to the ultimate building of the ‘One Country, Two Systems’ Taiwan model, a power sharing arrangement based on a separation of powers may still require some debate. Because a ‘separation of powers’ which has the flavor of federalism or confederation provides the Taiwan authorities with the ‘factual’ conditions or even a ‘jurisprudential’ basis for an ‘original separation of powers,’ it is also the core goal of the Taiwan authorities’ pursuit of a long-term ‘form of shared power,’ and on a fundamental level this violates the principle of popular sovereignty under which Taiwan’s future and destiny should be commonly determined by all Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.” 33"

Here we can borrow from the words of Comrade Deng Xiaoping cited above: is it really conceivable that post-peaceful-reunification Taiwan will have no destructive forces? Is it conceivable that nothing will happen to harm the fundamental interests of the nation? Is it conceivable that nothing will happen that harms the fundamental interests of Taiwan? At such time, should Beijing get involved or not? Therefore, it is in the interests of Taiwan that certain powers of the center be maintained."

An Attempt to Discuss the Nature of Taiwan’s High Degree of Autonomy After Peaceful Reunification: Based on the Practical Experience of Hong Kong,"Taiwan Studies , Wu Libin ","Feb 20, 2022","Based on the practical experience of Hong Kong and the reality of the situation regarding Taiwan, this paper has already proposed that, after peaceful reunification, Taiwan should enjoy delegated autonomy rather than shared-power autonomy. Here, it remains necessary to further discuss and explore the theory of shared-power autonomy from the perspectives of a unitary system and a federal system. The essence of the view that a peacefully reunified Taiwan will enjoy shared-power autonomy is that it advocates the introduction of certain features of federalism into the power allocation model of the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula. This view holds that “due to historical reasons, the Taiwan authorities are exercising some powers that should no longer be exercised by them, which makes it difficult to peacefully resolve the Taiwan issue through a reunification model based on a unitary system.” 34 Therefore, some features of a federal system must be introduced into the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan model. 35 This view further holds that, after the introduction of the features of federalism, Taiwan will transfer some original powers to the center, and the remaining original powers that it has not transferred will belong to Taiwan as “residual power.” 36 In other words, the theory of shared-power autonomy necessarily links federalism with the sharing of power from the local to the center, and the “residual power” belonging to the local government. However, this understanding is one-sided and misunderstands federalism."

Most countries in the world adopt the form of a unitary state. A unitary system refers to a form of state structure where, in the process of the vertical allocation and application of the right to exercise state power, the central government alone enjoys all sovereign powers and regional governments share the right to exercise other state powers. 37 The authority of local government in a unitary state is entrusted to it by the central government, and the local government must obey the leadership of the center and accept its supervision. 38 The fundamental feature of a unitary system is that, whether in terms of authority, public interest, or public finances, the highest and most fundamental decision-making power is put in the hands of the central government, and the powers which local governments share are only subordinate powers underneath these powers.39"
An Attempt to Discuss the Nature of Taiwan’s High Degree of Autonomy After Peaceful Reunification: Based on the Practical Experience of Hong Kong,"Taiwan Studies , Wu Libin ","Feb 20, 2022","Globally, more than 20 countries implement a federal system. 40 Federalism is a form of state structure where the exercise of state power, including sovereign power, is shared by the national government and regional governments according to a constitution. Neither side can unilaterally alter the constitutional power-sharing arrangement. 41 A federal state has both a federal or central government (legislature and executive bodies) and a number of state or local legislative bodies and governments. Both the federal and state governments derive their powers from the federal constitution, and both enjoy supreme authority in specific areas. 42 In terms of legislative power, a federal system is a constitutional regime in which the central legislature and the legislatures of the states or territorial units that make up the federation share legislative power. 43"
An Attempt to Discuss the Nature of Taiwan’s High Degree of Autonomy After Peaceful Reunification: Based on the Practical Experience of Hong Kong,"Taiwan Studies , Wu Libin ","Feb 20, 2022","The fundamental difference between a unitary system and a federal system is whether sovereign power is exclusively held by the central government or shared by the central government and regional governments. In a unitary system, the central government exclusively holds sovereign power. In a federal system, the central government shares sovereign power with the regional governments. 44 A unitary state does not preclude the possibility of local or other government agencies having powers entrusted or delegated to them by the central government. However, this power must be entrusted or delegated by the central government; it is not allocated. In a strict legal sense, all powers belong to the central government.45"
An Attempt to Discuss the Nature of Taiwan’s High Degree of Autonomy After Peaceful Reunification: Based on the Practical Experience of Hong Kong,"Taiwan Studies , Wu Libin ","Feb 20, 2022","Sovereign power is clearly a type of original power. In view of the concepts of, and differences between, unitary and federal systems presented above, to whom original power belongs becomes a key factor in distinguishing between unitary and federal systems. However, in terms of the original ownership of original power, which method a federal state adopts is not fixed. That is, federal states do not absolutely implement a “bottom-up” method from the local to the center. In fact, in terms of the original ownership of original power in federal states, there are three forms: the first is that of countries like the United States and Switzerland, where original power originally belongs to the states, and the power of the federation is granted it by the states. In other words, the original power of states is the “source,” and the original power of the federation “flows” to it from this source. This is a type of local to central sharing of power. In the second form, the original power originally belongs to a unified state, and it is only in order to better solve ethnic problems, problems of unbalanced economic development, or other specific problems that the unitary system is abandoned in favor of a federal system. That is, the original power of the federation is the “source,” and the original power of federation member units “flows” from this source. This is central to local sharing of power. The Russian Federation and the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are examples of this form. The third form is a hybrid of the first and second forms, such as that of the former Soviet Union; or where the original ownership of the original power is, for various reasons, very hazy, such as in Canada, Australia, India, and Pakistan, where it is difficult to convincingly determine the ownership of original power. 46"

There is not just one form of federalism. It can be divided into several forms, such as federalism based on the separation of powers and checks and balances, federalism based on democratic centralism, autonomous democratic federalism, centralized federalism, and so on. 47 Federalism based on the separation of powers and checks and balances is a fairly typical federal system. Federalism based on the separation of powers and checks and balances uses horizontal separation of powers (separation of executive, legislative, and judicial powers) and vertical separation of powers (separation of powers between the federation and federal member units) to realize checks and balances on power. The separation of powers is the precondition and basis of checks and balances. In the separation of powers between the federation and the federation member units, there are three methods of power separation: the first is to enumerate the powers of the federation in the constitution, with the member units generally retaining other powers, that is, the “residual powers” belong to the member units. Such federal states include the United States, Switzerland, Germany, and Mexico. The second is to enumerate the powers of each party in the constitution, with the powers that are not listed retained by the federation, that is, the “residual powers” belong to the federation. Canada and India have adopted this method. The third method is the type of separation of powers in the Russian Federation. According to the Constitution of the Russian Federation, the entities that make up the Russian Federation possess the “residual powers” outside of the jurisdiction of the federation and the common jurisdiction of the federation and its entities. However, due to the very broad language used by the Constitution to describe the exclusive powers of the federation and the common jurisdiction of the federation and its entities, there are very few “residual powers” that are actually exclusively held by the entities. 48"

This kind of institutional design has proven to be correct and appropriate in subsequent practice."
An Attempt to Discuss the Nature of Taiwan’s High Degree of Autonomy After Peaceful Reunification: Based on the Practical Experience of Hong Kong,"Taiwan Studies , Wu Libin ","Feb 20, 2022","The Taiwan issue, cross-strait reunification, and the issue of governance in post-reunification Taiwan are more complicated than in Hong Kong. The institutional design of the “One Country, Two Systems” Taiwan formula should fully draw on the practical experience from Hong Kong, maintain flexibility in power allocation, and maintain the power of the center to intervene in a timely and appropriate manner. However, the theory of shared-power autonomy is too rigid as regards the institutional design of central government power and lacks flexibility, which may lead to the central government having only extremely limited powers regarding the peacefully reunified Taiwan and make it unable to respond to, and deal with, new situations that may arise promptly and effectively. At the same time, the theory of shared-power autonomy contains misunderstandings about federalism and mechanically takes the federal model of the United States as the universal model of federal states around the world. This deserves discussion and reflection."
