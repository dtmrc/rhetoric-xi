We must adhere to the unity of integrity and innovation, strengthen and improve ourselves with the spirit of reform and innovation, and continue to open up the future through reforming the old and making new ones. Comprehensively and strictly governing the Party is an inherent requirement of self-revolution. We must always maintain the self-awareness of facing the problem and the courage to turn inward.
