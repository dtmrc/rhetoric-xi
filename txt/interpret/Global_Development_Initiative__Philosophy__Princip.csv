"Global Development Initiative: Philosophy, Principle, Path, and Progress",Center for International Knowledge on Development ,"Jun 20, 2022","Century-old changes and the once-in-a-century pandemic are intertwined, economic globalization has encountered adverse currents, digital transformation and green transition crises coexist, and human development is at a new crossroads. People of all countries have more ardent expectations for peaceful development, stronger calls for fairness and justice, and more determined pursuit of win-win cooperation. How can we beat the pandemic? How do we build a post-pandemic world? These are major issues of common concern to the whole world, and they are also urgent questions that all countries must answer. Chinese President Xi Jinping solemnly put forward the Global Development Initiative at the 76th United Nations General Assembly, calling on the international community to place development at a prominent position in the global macro policy framework, accelerate the implementation of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and jointly promote a new stage for balanced, coordinated, and inclusive global development. The Global Development Initiative adheres to the core concept of staying committed to the primacy of people, staying committed to benefits for all, staying committed to innovation-driven development, staying committed to harmony between man and nature, and staying committed to results-oriented actions, with climate change and green development, industrialization, the digital economy, and interconnection as key areas of cooperation, and puts forward China’s plan to answer the issues of the times, to build a better post-pandemic world, and to build a community with a shared future for mankind."

"Global Development Initiative: Philosophy, Principle, Path, and Progress",Center for International Knowledge on Development ,"Jun 20, 2022","Staying committed to development as a priority: People are the fundamental driving force of development, and improving people’s well-being is the fundamental purpose of development. The Global Development Initiative regards improving people’s well-being and realizing all-round development as its starting point and goal and takes people’s aspirations for a better life as its goal, insists that development is for the people, that development depends on the people, and that the fruits of development are shared by the people, so as to continuously improve people’s livelihood and enhance people’s sense of happiness, gain, and security."
"Global Development Initiative: Philosophy, Principle, Path, and Progress",Center for International Knowledge on Development ,"Jun 20, 2022","Staying committed to development as a priority and the drive for innovation: Development is an important foundation for solving global challenges and the eternal pursuit of human society. We must unswervingly follow the path of prioritizing development. As the most populous country, China’s development from a relatively backward productivity level to the world’s second largest economy has proved that only by unswervingly persisting in development can a country be prosperous and strong and its people live a happy life. Whether eradicating extreme poverty around the world, responding to food security crises, responding to the impact of the pandemic, quelling conflicts and turmoil, or resolving humanitarian crises, all rely on development. The Global Development Initiative focuses on development, puts development cooperation in a prominent position in global macro policy coordination, solves prominent problems and fundamental challenges in state governance through development, seizes the opportunities of the new industrial revolution, and provides more momentum for common development and accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development."
"Global Development Initiative: Philosophy, Principle, Path, and Progress",Center for International Knowledge on Development ,"Jun 20, 2022","Staying committed to leaving no country and no one behind: Issues such as the North-South gap, recovery differentiation, development gaps, and technological gaps have become increasingly prominent. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated inequalities between and within countries. The United Nations 2022 World Economic Situation and Prospects report pointed out that the per capita GDP of developed economies will fully recover to pre-pandemic levels in 2023, while the per capita GDP of developing and transition economies will continue below the pre-pandemic level of 64. The Global Development Initiative is a global public product that bridges the development gap and cracks the development deficit. It is committed to promoting inclusive development, addressing imbalances and inadequacies in development among and within countries, and enhancing the fairness, effectiveness, and inclusiveness of global development, leaving no country behind. The Global Development Initiative pays attention to the special development difficulties of developing countries, especially the least developed countries, small island developing states, and landlocked developing countries, so that all countries and all groups of people can enjoy the benefits of development equitably."
"Global Development Initiative: Philosophy, Principle, Path, and Progress",Center for International Knowledge on Development ,"Jun 20, 2022","Staying committed to harmony between man and nature: Green and low carbon is the most sustainable development momentum, and a good ecological environment is the most conducive to people’s well-being. The Global Development Initiative advocates seizing the opportunities of technological development and economic transformation, accelerating green and low-carbon transformation, promoting the optimization and upgrading of energy and industrial structures, and taking the road of green recovery and sustainable development.

"Global Development Initiative: Philosophy, Principle, Path, and Progress",Center for International Knowledge on Development ,"Jun 20, 2022","Global development requires a clear vision and goals but also pragmatic actions. The Global Development Initiative adheres to an action-oriented approach, transforming global development consensus into pragmatic actions for international development cooperation. Starting from the protection and improvement of people’s livelihood and from the most pressing issues of global development, it focuses on key cooperation areas such as poverty reduction, food security, pandemic control and vaccines, development financing, climate change and green development, industrialization, the digital economy, and connectivity. The initiative carries out cooperation projects such as people’s livelihood development, technical cooperation, knowledge sharing, and capacity building and meets the development needs of all parties to build a beneficial platform and promote the implementation of the 2030 Agenda."
"Global Development Initiative: Philosophy, Principle, Path, and Progress",Center for International Knowledge on Development ,"Jun 20, 2022","The Global Development Initiative tackles pressing development challenges such as poverty reduction, food security, pandemic control and vaccines, and creates the preconditions for a smooth post-pandemic recovery.

"Global Development Initiative: Philosophy, Principle, Path, and Progress",Center for International Knowledge on Development ,"Jun 20, 2022","The Global Development Initiative focuses on synergies with existing cooperation mechanisms, and all parties work together to build a global development community. The Global Development Initiative is neither intended to replace the existing international development agenda, nor is it a fragmentation of the existing 2030 Agenda and its goals. The Global Development Initiative is a “refocus” on development issues, a “recommitment” to the Sustainable Development Goals, a “reinvigoration” of global partnerships, and a “reactivation” of international development cooperation, aiming to arouse the international community focus on development issues, promote the strengthening of the global development partnership, form international synergy, effectively respond to the challenges posed by the pandemic to development, and help developing countries accelerate their recovery and realize the 2030 Agenda as scheduled. The Global Development Initiative will strengthen the alignment of development cooperation strategies with all parties, especially with the African Union’s Agenda 2063, ASEAN Community Vision 2025, the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), and the Partnership for Africa’s Development Initiative. The development process of each region and each mechanism is synergistic, promotes one another, and achieves one another. The Global Development Initiative will revolve around all 17 SDGs, relying on or linking existing multilateral mechanisms and platforms to strengthen effective actions, including the strong synergy to promote the United Nations, APEC, G20, BRICS, Shanghai Cooperation Organization, “10+1” and other multilateral cooperation mechanisms and regional and sub-regional platforms to bring together a strong synergy for common development. This will encourage the role of international organizations, governments, business circles, academia, and civil society to compose a symphony for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda."

All parties generally believe that under the current situation, all countries should further strengthen their political will, push development issues back to the core of the international agenda, create a momentum of attaching importance to development and seeking common cooperation, and oppose the politicization and marginalization of development issues. It is necessary to strengthen cooperation in poverty reduction, agriculture, the digital economy, and other fields, deal with many challenges such as energy and food, and strive to achieve the 17 sustainable development goals on schedule and achieve leapfrog development. It is necessary to speed up the improvement of the global governance system, increase the representation and voice of emerging markets and developing countries, promote the building of an open world economy, create a favorable environment for accelerating global development, and build an equal and balanced global development partnership.
