Speech by Comrade Chen Quanguo at the First and Second Plenary Sessions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Ninth Committee of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the Chinese Communist Party,Chen Quanguo ,"Oct 30, 2017","(i) A new era accomplishes historical changes. In his report, General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that the five years since the 18th Party Congress have been an extremely remarkable five years in the development process of the Party and the country. Over the past five years, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core has scientifically grasped the development trends of today’s world and contemporary China, adapted to practical requirements and the aspirations of the people, raised the flag to set the orientation and devised strategies, taken command of the great struggle, the great project, the great cause, and the great dream, and holistically promoted the “Five Spheres in One” overall layout and coordinated the promotion of the “Four Comprehensives” strategic layout. With great political courage and a strong readiness to shoulder responsibility, it has proposed a series of new concepts, new ideas, and new strategies, issued a series of major principles and policies, introduced a series of major measures, and promoted a series of major tasks. It has solved many difficult problems that for a long time solutions were hoped for but not found, accomplished many great things that had previously been wanted but not accomplished, and promoted historic changes in the cause of the Party and the country. The face of the Party, the face of the country, the face of the people, the face of the military, and the face of the Chinese nation have undergone unprecedented changes. These historic changes are comprehensive and groundbreaking, they are deep-seated and fundamental, and they have a significant and far-reaching impact on the development of the Party and the country. After long-term efforts, socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era. This is a new historical orienting point in China’s development. The entrance of socialism with Chinese characteristics into a new era means that the Chinese nation, which since modern times has suffered so much, has welcomed the great leap from standing up and becoming rich to becoming strong and has welcomed a bright future for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. It means that scientific socialism resounds with great vitality in 21st century China and has raised high the great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics on the world stage. It means that the path, theory, system, and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics continue to develop, and have opened up a path for developing countries to modernize, providing a brand-new choice for those countries and nations in the world who want to both accelerate their development and maintain their independence, and contributing Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions to solving the problems of humanity. This new era is an era of inheriting the past and ushering in the future, continuing the past and opening up the future, and continuing to win the great victory of socialism with Chinese characteristics under new historical conditions. It is an era of decisive victory in building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and from there building a powerful modern socialist country in an all-round way. It is an era in which people of all ethnic groups throughout the country will work together in unity, constantly create better lives, and gradually realize common prosperity for all the people. It is an era when all Chinese sons and daughters work together with one heart and strive to realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. It is an era in which China is increasingly approaching the center of the world stage and continues to make greater contributions to mankind. With the entrance of socialism with Chinese characteristics into a new era, the principal contradiction in our society has transformed into the contradiction between the people’s ever-growing needs for a better life and unbalanced and inadequate development, which has introduced many new demands for the work of the Party and the state. That socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era is of major significance in the history of the development of the People’s Republic of China and the development of the Chinese nation, as well as in the history of the development of world socialism and the history of human society. We must deeply realize that the most important and critical reason that the Party and the country can achieve brilliant achievements and historic changes is that our Party has General Secretary Xi Jinping as the core leader at the helm and has the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core. We must resolutely protect the core position and authority of General Secretary Xi Jinping, resolutely protect the authority and the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee, and continuously push forward various undertakings in accordance with the requirements of the new era."
Speech by Comrade Chen Quanguo at the First and Second Plenary Sessions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Ninth Committee of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the Chinese Communist Party,Chen Quanguo ,"Oct 30, 2017","(ii) New thought leads the way forward. Since the 18th Party Congress, the members of the CCP, with General Secretary Xi Jinping as their main representative, focused on the major epochal question of what kind of socialism with Chinese characteristics to uphold and develop in the new era and how to uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics, took a brand-new perspective to deepen understanding of the laws of Communist Party rule, the laws of socialist construction, and the laws of the development of human society, carried out arduous theoretical explorations, and achieved major theoretical innovations, thereby forming Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is the inheritance and development of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the important thought of “Three Represents,” and the Scientific Outlook on Development. It is the latest achievement of the Sinicization of Marxism. It is the crystallization of the practical experience and collective wisdom of the Party and the people. It is an important part of the theoretical system of socialism with Chinese characteristics. It is the ideological beacon, spiritual pillar, source of strength, and magic weapon of victory for the Chinese Communists in the new era. It is the action plan for the whole Party and the people of all ethnic groups nationwide to strive for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. It is the guiding ideology that our Party must adhere to over the long term. It is a concentrated demonstration of the great theoretical courage, extraordinary political wisdom, and profound original ideas of General Secretary Xi Jinping and will inevitably lead the ship carrying the great dream of the Chinese people as it breaks through the waves and sails victoriously to the glorious shore so as to make the Chinese nation stand more loftily in the forest of world nations. We must firmly grasp the main connotations of the “Eight Clarifications” of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and the basic strategy of the “Fourteen Commitments,” unswervingly hold high the great banner of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, unswervingly unify thinking and arm the mind with Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and unswervingly implement Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era throughout the entire process of promoting social stability and long-term stability in Xinjiang and of building a Chinese socialist Xinjiang (中国特色社会主义新疆), and embody it in all aspects of Party building."
Speech by Comrade Chen Quanguo at the First and Second Plenary Sessions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Ninth Committee of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the Chinese Communist Party,Chen Quanguo ,"Oct 30, 2017","(iii) The new mission brings together boundless strength. In his report, General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that the original intention and mission of the Chinese Communists was to pursue happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation. Today, we are closer to achieving the goal of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation than at any other time in history, and are more confident and capable of doing so. The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is not something that can be achieved easily, by just making a lot of celebratory noises. The whole Party must be prepared to make harder and more difficult efforts. To achieve great dreams, we must engage in great struggles. This struggle is a great struggle with many new historical features. We must more consciously uphold the Party’s leadership and China’s socialist system and resolutely oppose all words and deeds that weaken, distort, or deny the Party’s leadership and China’s socialist system. We must more consciously protect the interests of the people and resolutely oppose all acts that harm the interests of the people and separate from the masses. We must more consciously devote ourselves to the epochal trend of reform and innovation and resolutely eliminate all stubborn diseases. We must more consciously safeguard China’s sovereignty, security, and development interests and resolutely oppose all acts that split the motherland and undermine national unity and social harmony and stability. We must more consciously prevent all types of risks and resolutely overcome all difficulties and challenges in the political, economic, cultural, social, and other fields as well as in the natural world. We must fully understand the protracted, complex, and arduous nature of this great struggle, develop the spirit of struggle, improve our abilities for struggle, and continuously win new victories in the great struggle. To achieve great dreams, we must build a great project. This great project is the new great project of Party building that our Party is currently advancing in a deep-reaching way. We must more consciously uphold the principles of Party spirit, courageously face problems head-on, dare to scrape to the bone to remove the poison, eliminate all factors that damage the advanced nature and purity of the Party, clear away all the viruses that erode the Party’s healthy body, continuously enhance the Party’s political leadership, ideological leadership, mass organization capabilities, and social appeal, and ensure that our Party will always maintain strong vitality and strong combat effectiveness. To achieve great dreams, we must pursue a great cause. This great cause is the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics. It is necessary to more consciously enhance self-confidence in this road, theory, system, and culture, rather than taking the old road of closure and rigidity or the wrong road of changing our banner. We must maintain our political steadfastness, insist on working hard to rejuvenate our country, and always uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics. We must firmly grasp the original intention and mission of the Chinese Communists and, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core, integrate efforts to conduct the great struggle, construct the great project, advance the great cause, and realize the great dream, threading them together and advancing them in combination. With this, in the great practice of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, we will better shoulder the historical mission of building a Chinese socialist Xinjiang."
Speech by Comrade Chen Quanguo at the First and Second Plenary Sessions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Ninth Committee of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the Chinese Communist Party,Chen Quanguo ,"Oct 30, 2017","(iv) The new goals draw a grand blueprint. In his report, General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that the period from the 19th Party Congress to the 20th Party Congress is the historical intersection of the Two Centenary Goals. We must both build to completion a moderately prosperous society in all respects and achieve the first centenary goal, and also take advantage of this momentum to start a new journey of building a modern socialist country in an all-round way and march towards the second centenary goal. In the comprehensive analysis of the international and domestic situation and China’s development conditions, the period from 2020 to the middle of this century can be arranged in two stages. The first stage, from 2020 to 2035, based on having built a moderately prosperous society in all respects, will basically achieve socialist modernization. The second stage, from 2035 to the middle of the century, will establish China as powerful modern socialist country that is rich, strong, democratic, civilized, harmonious, and beautiful. This strategic arrangement shows that our Party will lead the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country to complete the second centenary goal 15 years ahead of schedule, so that the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation presents a new picture. We must firmly grasp the new goal of building a modern socialist country in an all-round way in two steps. According to the blueprint drawn up by the 19th Party Congress, we will grasp the objective like deeply rooted bamboo in the wind refusing to let go, roll up our sleeves and redouble our efforts. With unrelenting hard work and perseverance, we will courageously forge ahead to new goals."
Speech by Comrade Chen Quanguo at the First and Second Plenary Sessions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Ninth Committee of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the Chinese Communist Party,Chen Quanguo ,"Oct 30, 2017","(v) The new deployments initiate a great journey. In his report, General Secretary Xi Jinping made comprehensive deployments for the economic construction, political construction, cultural construction, social construction, and ecological civilization construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. In terms of economic construction, we must implement the new development concept, build a modernized economic system, treat supply-side structural reforms as the main thread, and promote reforms in the quality, efficiency, and power of economic development, continuously enhancing the innovative capacity and competitiveness of the Chinese economy. In terms of political construction, we must uphold the organic unity of the Party’s leadership, the people as masters of the country, and the country’s law-based governance, improve the system of institutions for the people being masters of the country and develop socialist democratic politics, and promote the institutionalization, standardization, development of rule of law, and the proceduralization of socialist democratic politics. In terms of cultural construction, we must strengthen cultural self-confidence, promote the prospering of socialist culture, cultivate and practice the socialist core values, strengthen ideological and moral construction, promote the flourishing of socialist literature and art, and drive forward the development of cultural undertakings and cultural industries. In terms of social construction, we must raise the standards of guaranteeing and improving people’s wellbeing, strengthen and innovate social governance, continuously meet the people’s growing needs for a better life, and allow the fruits of reform and development to benefit all the people more equally and fairly. In the construction of ecological civilization, we must practice the concept that clean waters and green mountains are invaluable assets, accelerate the reform of the ecological civilization institutions, form spatial patterns, industrial structures, production methods, and lifestyles that save resources and protect the environment, and build a beautiful China. At the same time, the 19th Party Congress also made important deployments in areas including adhering to the path of strengthening the military with Chinese characteristics, comprehensively promoting the modernization of national defense and the military, adhering to “one country, two systems,” promoting the reunification of the motherland, and adhering to the path of peaceful development and promoting the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. We should further refine and concretize the goals and tasks set forth at the 19th Party Congress and implement them in all aspects of the work for Xinjiang’s stable development."

In his report, General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era, and our Party must have a new look and take new actions. To unite and lead the people to carry out the great struggle, advance the great cause, and realize the great dream, the Party must unswervingly uphold and improve the Party’s leadership and unswervingly build the Party to be stronger. We must deeply grasp the general requirements of Party building in the new era, uphold and strengthen the Party’s comprehensive leadership, uphold the Party’s self-administration and comprehensive, strict Party self-governance, and adhere to the focal thread being strengthening the Party’s long-term governance capacity building and advanced nature and purity construction. With the Party’s political construction as the commander, firm ideals, beliefs, and aims as the foundation, and mobilization of the enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity of the whole Party as the focus, we must comprehensively promote the Party’s political construction, ideological construction, organizational construction, work style construction, and discipline construction, incorporate institutional construction throughout this process, promote the fight against corruption in a deep-reaching way, and continuously improve the quality of Party building. We must build the Party into a Marxist ruling party that is always at the forefront of the times, is sincerely supported by the people, has the courage to conduct self-revolution, can withstand the test of various storms, and is full of vigor. We must ensure that the Party is always at the forefront of the times in the historical process of profound changes in the world situation, that it always becomes the backbone of the people throughout the country in the historical process of coping with various risks and tests at home and abroad, and that it is always the strong leadership core in the historical process of upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics.

We must persist in combining the study and implementation of the spirit of the 19th Party Congress and the study and implementation of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era with the implementation of the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important speeches and important instructions on Xinjiang work; with the implementation of the Strategy for Governing Xinjiang of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core, especially the overall objective of social stability and long-term stability; with work to normalize and institutionalize “Two Studies, One Be” study and education; with topical education on “remaining true to our original intention, keeping our mission firmly in mind”; and with doing current work, completing annual goals and tasks, and planning next year’s work. We must be deeply aware that the Strategy for Governing Xinjiang of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core and General Secretary Xi Jinping’s important speeches and important instructions on Xinjiang work are an important component of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. Doing a good job of Xinjiang work under the new situation and achieving the overall objective of social stability and long-term stability constitutes the vivid practice of the great struggle with many new historical characteristics and constitutes the concrete performance of strengthening the “Four Consciousnesses,” resolutely implementing Party Central Committee decisions and deployments, and maintaining a high degree of consistency with the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core. We must unswervingly follow the decisions and deployments of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core, firmly establishing “one overall objective:” regionwide top to bottom we must raise the banner of the overall objective of social stability and long-term stability, take the overall objective as the focal point of attention and action, always ensure we are keeping the overall objective in our hearts, carrying it on our shoulders, and grasping it in our hands, be ever-focused on and resolute in implementing the overall objective, and use the overall objective to unify thinking, understanding, pace, and action, leading all items of work in Xinjiang. We must grasp the “two key points”: correctly handle the relationship between stability and development, grasp the two key points of stability and development, follow the requirement that the main responsible comrades of the Party and government at all levels take the lead, form two sets of work teams, one team that does all it can to maintain stability and another team that concentrates on development, and establish a responsibility system where each level is responsible for implementation at that level and all levels act. We must consolidate “one good mechanism”: coordinate and integrate various resources, and build a command system and working mechanism that coordinates and facilitates linked action of Party, government, military, police, militia, and people and that is unified and efficient. We must deliver a “set of combination punches”: unswervingly focus on the overall objective and deliver a good “combination punch,” adhere to the “Six Doing Goods” (doing a good job in the strike hard struggle [严打斗争], doing a good job in national unity, doing a good job of religious work, doing a good job in improving people’s wellbeing, doing a good job in ideology, and doing a good job in the primary-level foundation), achieve the “Five Controls” (control the networks, control the borders, control the societal setting, control the key areas, and control people of Xinjiang household registration in the interior [内地新疆籍人员]), promote the “Four Full Coverages” (full coverage by Party organizations, full coverage by mass work, full coverage by rapid handling, and full coverage by shifts in work style), lock in the “One Do Not Relax” (do not relax reform and development), maintain the “One Normalization” (normalization and long-term effect of anti-terrorism and stability maintenance), strive to realize the “Three Resolutes” (resolutely prevent large-scale violent and terrorist incidents, resolutely curb the trend of frequent violent and terrorist incidents, and resolutely prevent violent and terrorist activities from spreading to the interior), and effectively safeguard, stabilize, and develop Xinjiang’s vast territory of more than 1.6 million square kilometers."

With this we must be fully aware that there has not been a fundamental change in the situation of Xinjiang being in “convergence of three periods”—a period of active violent terrorist activities, a period of intense anti-separatist struggle, and a period of intervention, treatment, and growing pains; be fully aware of the protracted, complex, and acute nature of Xinjiang’s anti-separatist struggle; be fully aware that the fight to counter terrorism and maintain stability is a protracted and a formidable battle; and unswervingly treat maintaining stability as a political task that overrides all else and a political responsibility of immense importance.

Speech by Comrade Chen Quanguo at the First and Second Plenary Sessions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Ninth Committee of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the Chinese Communist Party,Chen Quanguo ,"Oct 30, 2017","In the new era, we must implement new thought. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out: “ideological construction is the Party’s foundational construction.” Thought is the precursor of action, and scientific thought is the guiding light that shows the path. Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is the biggest theoretical gain and achievement of our Party since the 18th Party Congress. It is the greatest highlight and the biggest historical contribution of the report to the 19th Party Congress. It is another historic leap in the integration of Marxism-Leninism with China’s reality. It is a guide to action for the whole Party and the whole people to strive for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Shining bright and dazzling with the light of Marxist truth, it has opened up a new realm of the Sinicization of Marxism. We must be sure to treat Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as the ideological soul that guides all work, the beacon of progress, and our scientific guide; as a fixed star, compass, and navigator in managing the fundamentals, the direction, and the long-term; and as the spiritual pillar, source of strength, and victory-securing magic weapon of all Party members and cadres. We must unswervingly use Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era to unify thought and action, and open up a brighter and more beautiful future in the new practice of Xinjiang’s stable development, letting Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era shine across the Tianshan Mountains and radiate a powerful force of truth."

General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out that: “the original intention and mission of the Chinese Communists were to pursue happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation.” The sons and daughters of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are important members of the big family of the motherland, possessing pure feelings of love for the Party and the great motherland, the glorious tradition of safeguarding the unity of the motherland and unity of all ethnic groups, and an outstanding character of diligence, courage, and self-improvement. They are dear, lovable, and respected members of our family. We must be sure not to forget our original intention and keep our mission in mind, adhere to the people-centered development philosophy, always keep the people of all ethnic groups in the highest position in our hearts, always take the people’s yearning for a better life as the goal of our struggle, and always desire to be together, and work together, with people of all ethnic groups, caring for them passionately and loving them. With the readiness to shoulder responsibility of “hoping that everyone is full and warm” and with love for the people like “caring for each branch and each leaf,” we must do more heart-warming projects that improve production and living conditions, do more practical deeds that benefit the people, solve more practical difficulties of concern to people of all ethnic groups, and focus on the interest-related problems that most concern and most directly and practically affect the masses. We must do one thing and then turn to the next thing, working year after year, continuously enhancing the sense of gain, happiness, and security of the people of all ethnic groups and maximize the unity of the people of all ethnic groups around the Party and the government."

General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out: “a good mental state is an important prerequisite for doing all work well.” Situated in a great era and keeping up with the pace of progress, we must always maintain an indomitable and energetic mental state. We must be sure to be high-spirited, forge ahead, have the courage to change, and have the courage to innovate, never be rigid and never be stagnant, dare to tackle tough problems, dare to foray into dangerous shoals, open a tunnel upon meeting a mountain and build a bridge upon meeting a river, continuously promote innovation in ideas, work, institutions, and mechanisms, strive to walk well the road of the long march in the new era, and always become the backbone in leading people of all ethnic groups to build Chinese socialist Xinjiang (中国特色社会主义新疆) and the bellwether in promoting social stability and long-term stability. We must promote righteousness and advocate new styles, champion values such as loyalty, sincerity, fairness, decency, seeking truth from facts, honesty, and integrity, resolutely oppose being two-faced and double-dealing, firmly and resolutely declare war on the “Four Malfeasances” and “Four Energies,” and always ensure we are loyal to the Party, perform duties and responsibilities fully, and be full of sincerity toward the masses. No matter the occasion or circumstance, we must always act in strict accordance with the principles and policies of the Party, maintain a vigorous, zealous, and righteous spirit, genuinely live up to being as the General Secretary requires of us, needing not the compliments of others, but only to spread positivity (不要人夸颜色好，只留清气满乾坤).

General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out: “the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is not something that can be achieved easily, by just making a lot of celebratory noises. The whole Party must be prepared to make harder and more difficult efforts.” Empty talk harms the country, hard and practical work makes it thrive. Building a harmonious and beautiful Xinjiang requires hard work and sweat, and it must be done step by step. We must work hard and keep our noses to the grindstone, constantly fight both day and night and act vigorously and resolutely, practice perseverance and dedication, spend all our time at our posts and lose ourselves in the work, keep our feet firmly planted in the reality on the ground, conscientiously implement the strategic deployments proposed by the Party Central Committee, implement the work arrangements made by the Party Committee of the Autonomous Region for implementing the spirit of the 19th Party Congress, take practical actions, formulate to-do lists, timetables, and roadmaps, progress one time-point by time-point on the schedule, accomplish our tasks in the spirit of grasping iron with the vigor to leave hand prints, stepping on stones with the vigor to leave footprints, and driving in nails, work with the tenacity of deeply rooted bamboo that is able to withstand the buffets of the wind from all directions, implement with an attitude such that failure to do a job well leaves our food seem tasteless and keeps us up at night, ensure the smooth realization of the goals, tasks, and strategic deployments set by the Party Central Committee, and never fail to live up to the high trust placed in us by the General Secretary and the Party Central Committee."

General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out: “history will only favor those who are determined, those who strive, and those who fight. It will not wait for those who hesitate, those who are slack, and those who fear difficulties.” The vast land of great and beautiful Xinjiang provides a broad stage for exhibiting talents and a vast world for making achievements. Every one of us as members of the Communist Party must bravely be a pioneer, participant, and writer at the forefront of the times and insist on seeing our posts as a position to guard, seeing our work as a profession, and seeing dedication as a duty. We must take the initiative to integrate the pursuit of our personal ideals into the grand cause of the country and the nation as well as into the concrete practice of social stability and long-term stability in Xinjiang. We must firmly and resolutely implement the Party Central Committee’s Strategy for Governing Xinjiang, focus on the overall objective and deliver a good “combination punch,” unswervingly safeguard overall social harmony and stability, unswervingly promote sustainable and healthy economic development, unswervingly guarantee the improvement of people’s wellbeing, unswervingly consolidate ethnic unity, unswervingly promote religious harmony, unswervingly do a good job in ideological work, unswervingly ensure the consolidation of our frontiers, unswervingly protect the ecological environment, unswervingly promote the reform and development of the XPCC, unswervingly implement comprehensive and strict governance of the Party, create a new situation of continuous, long-term, and comprehensive stability and of healthy economic and social development in Xinjiang, hand in a passing exam sheet that can stand the test of practice, the people, and history, and take big strides towards a promising future."
