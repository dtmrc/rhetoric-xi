In the face of this pandemic, it is necessary to rethink national development strategy and national security strategy, as well as the corresponding issues of economic structure and industrial structure, and especially issues of financial understanding and positioning."

This sort of blindness has its origins in the influence of neoliberalism. However, the performance of the United States in this pandemic has been chaotic, shocking the whole world, and causing people with different ideologies and values to wonder why this is the case."

The United States has been conducting this experiment over the last half-century, and now we must admit: The experiment has failed.” Perhaps these changes, which have occurred and continue to occur, can help some in the domestic financial community dispel the myth of the American financial model."

I believe that China’s financial community today also needs to liberate its mind and think about China based on China’s national conditions and on socialist values. We must have an ideological emancipation, and do away with the financial development path of “foreign superstition” and “foreign stereotypes.”"

By 2008, the model had “reached its peak.” The global financial crisis then erupted, hitting the global economy hard and continuing to affect it to this day."

China’s economic momentum has weakened in recent years, declining gradually, and one important reason is the financialization of the economy."

I still use the year 2006 before the U.S. financial crisis as an example for comparison. In 2006, the total profit of large-scale industrial enterprises in China was 1.8784 trillion yuan, and in 2019, the total profit of large-scale industrial enterprises in China was 6.1996 trillion yuan, with the latter having increased to 2.3 times the former."

Within the short space of thirteen years, the rapid shrinkage of the weight of industrial enterprise profits in the overall economy, together with the large increase in the ratio of financial enterprise profits, illustrate that the trend of financialization of the economy is already very significant."

Unlike small countries that live off of natural endowments and can passively or actively accept the international division of labor, sitting on the sidelines, China must establish a relatively complete, self-contained, healthy, and balanced industrial system and economic ecosystem, whether from the perspective of people’s well-being and sustainable economic development, or from the perspective of safeguarding national security."

For many years, some people have seen that in Western countries, including some developing countries whose economies are lagging behind ours, the service sector’s share of GDP is much higher than ours, so they put forward the idea of establishing China as a service sector power. Is this sort of view correct?"
Do Away with “U.S. Financial Model Superstition”! China Must Go its Own Way in Finance,"Origin and Original Intent , Zhang Yundong ","Mar 15, 2022","First of all, the increasing share of the service industry in the economic structure is due to the technical support that development of the manufacturing industry provides for the social life field, creating demand.

Implementation of the “deindustrialization” policy has not only led to industrial imbalance and industrial softening in the United States, seriously affecting the normal cycle of the overall economic system, but also created a large “rust belt,” increasing the gap between rich and poor, and causing social divisions to emerge. When the COVID-19 pandemic was approaching, the United States, which claims to be the number one developed country in the world, was unable to guarantee even the most basic public health and safety because of the lack of manufacturing, and was in chaos."

To this end, it is necessary to clarify two questions: First, where might major financial risks appear?

In order to provide direct financing services to the real economy, we need a primary market for issuing stocks. In order to provide shareholders a convenient means of allocating resources and transferring shares, they need to be provided with a secondary market for trading stocks. The financing capacity of the primary market is directly proportional to the liquidity of the secondary market, and the two are closely related. Therefore, to provide direct financing services to the real economy, there must be a stock trading market with relatively active trading."

China Must Go its Own Way in Finance,"Origin and Original Intent , Zhang Yundong ","Mar 15, 2022","In a stock market, whether investors or speculators are active in the market depends on the overall market atmosphere. Speculators using financial leverage rarely enter the market during bear markets or when the markets are inactive, and are unlikely to provide liquidity to markets when they need it. When a market enters a bull market and is lively, and the problem is no longer a lack of liquidity in the market, but rather preventing the market from overheating with excess liquidity, speculators will instead use financial leverage to enter the market in a big way, quickly inflating a stock market bubble, overextending the bull market, shortening the bull market cycle, and increasing stock market risk."

This appellation can be justified in micro situations, but it is wrong when viewed at the macro level. Financial derivatives, through the confluence of multiple internal and external factors, or even under the influence of small probability events, will undergo fission that cannot be measured or controlled, and instead of controlling risks, will cause a financial crisis."
