Political building is the fundamental building work of the Party. Since the 18th Party Congress, General Secretary Xi Jinping has made a series of important expositions on strengthening political building, making original contributions to the development of Marxist party building ideas and providing the fundamental guidelines for advancing political building in the new era. Strengthening political building is an inevitable requirement for comprehensively and strictly governing the Party and the police, and it is an eternal and critical issue of the politics and law front. We must adhere to strengthening political building as the guide, deeply understand the decisive significance of the “Two Affirmations,” resolutely live up to the “Two Upholds,” forever maintain a political character of loyalty, cleanliness, and responsibility, and help “China’s governance” to create new miracles.
The most fundamental guide to political building work: Arm the mind with Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, strengthen the political consciousness of casting the soul and strengthening the body
Political resolve stems from theoretical clarity. Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is the latest achievement of the Sinification and modernization of Marxism, the essence for our times of Chinese culture and Chinese spirit, the ideological banner that guides the Chinese nation to grow strong, and the guide to action for the people of the nation to march towards the second centenary goal. We must treat studying deeply, understanding thoroughly, and putting into action Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as our own political requirements, work needs, and spiritual pursuits. We must strengthen the endogenous driving force for the study of the Party’s innovative theory and constantly seek practical results in the combination of “learning, understanding, research, and application.” We must take the lead in being firm believers, active disseminators, and faithful practitioners of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.
Be committed to the pairing of study with understanding to promote comprehension. Be committed to reading more of the original works, diligently studying original texts, and deeply understanding the principles, earnestly studying the significance, scientific system, essence, and practical requirements of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and deeply comprehending its original contribution to the Sinification and modernization of Marxism. Deeply understand the truth that when it comes to “why the Chinese Communist Party can, and why socialism with Chinese characteristics is good, ultimately, it is because Marxism is great.” Instill this in your mind and take this truth to heart.
Be committed to the pairing of study with research to promote deepening. Accurately grasp the Marxist epistemology contained in Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and continuously deepen understanding and research on the laws of the Communist Party’s governance, the laws of socialist construction, and the laws of the development of human society. Consciously use Marxist standpoints, viewpoints, and methods, deepen research on “the great matters of the nation” (国之大者), deepen research on major theoretical and practical issues in the field of politics and law, and better grasp the laws of politics and law work in the new era.
Be committed to the pairing of study with application to promote transformations. Promote the learning style of linking theory with practice and strive to transform achievements in studying and implementing Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era into political consciousness regarding strengthening the “Four Consciousnesses,” firming up the “Four Matters of Confidence,” and achieving the “Two Upholds.” Transform such achievements into innovative ideas for promoting the high-quality development of politics and law work. Transform such achievements into effective measures for promoting self-revolution on the politics and law front; and transform them into a strong capacity for preventing risks, ensuring security, and protecting stability, striving to build a higher level of security for China.
The most important requirements of political building: Resolutely achieving the “Two Upholds” and resolutely obeying the command of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core
The politics and law front must treat achieving the “Two Upholds” as the top priority of strengthening political building, implement this throughout all aspects and the whole process of performing duties and responsibilities, and resolutely safeguard General Secretary Xi Jinping’s status as the core of the Party Central Committee and the core of the whole party.
In terms of sentiment, wholeheartedly embrace the core. The Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core has led the whole Party and the people of the whole nation to usher in a new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, opening up a new realm of Sinification and modernization of Marxism, creating a new great cause to achieve the first centenary goal, and launching a new journey in the march towards the second centenary goal. The Chinese nation has ushered in a great leap, from standing up and becoming rich, to becoming strong. General Secretary Xi Jinping’s great prestige, leadership style, outstanding wisdom, charisma, and feelings for the people have become a huge spiritual force that inspires and motivates us. We sincerely feel that the fact that General Secretary Xi Jinping has become the popularly supported and well-deserved core of the Party, people’s leader, and commander-in-chief of the army is the great fortune of the Party, the country, and the people. We must always be loyally devoted to protecting the core and embracing the core.
Mentally, always keep close to the core. In the face of great changes unseen in a century, the closer we get to our goal, the more complex the situation and the more arduous the task, the more we need General Secretary Xi Jinping to be at the helm to navigate and the more we need the steadying role of the CCP Central Committee’s centralized and unified leadership. The politics and law front must unremittingly arm our minds with Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and make timely efforts to follow, study and implement General Secretary Xi Jinping’s new ideas, new thoughts, and new strategies, and fully understand what General Secretary Xi Jinping is concerned with and is emphasizing. We must consolidate the ideological foundation of aligning with the core and listening to the command of the Party Central Committee, ensuring that new-era politics and law work always moves ahead in the right direction as pointed out by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
Politically, remain absolutely loyal to the core. Building political loyalty is the primary task of building an invincible political and legal army. Achieving the “Two Upholds” is the most fundamental requirement of political loyalty. The politics and law front must treat achieving the “Two Upholds” as the basic political norm to abide by, as the fundamental political requirement to implement, and as the greatest political discipline and political rule to enforce. We must always maintain a high degree of consistency with the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core in terms of political position, political direction, political principles, and political path.
In action, resolutely defend the core. Being committed to achieving the “Two Upholds” means it is imperative to put them into action. The politics and law front must thoroughly implement the important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping and the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee. We must resolutely obey the orders of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core, ensuring that we resolutely respond to what the Party Central Committee advocates, resolutely comply with what the Party Central Committee decides, and resolutely put a stop to what the Party Central Committee prohibits. We must resolutely oppose words and actions that undermine the Party’s centralized, unified leadership, resolutely struggle against phenomena that affect the unity of the Party, and resolutely eradicate risks and hidden troubles that affect national political security.
The most urgent issue of political building work: thoroughly eliminate the toxic effects of Sun Lijun’s political gang and effectively optimize the political ecology of politics and law organs
The earnest investigation and punishment of Sun Lijun’s political gang fully demonstrates the firm determination of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core to comprehensively and strictly govern the Party. The politics and law front must be certain to completely eliminate the toxic influence of Sun Lijun’s political gang, use cases to warn, use cases to promote reform, and use cases to promote governance so as thoroughly “detoxify” and purify the political ecology of politics and law organs.
Recognize the critical nature of “detoxification.” Sun Lijun’s political gang is a typical example of disloyalty and dishonesty to the Party and the “Seven Presences [of Political Misbehaviours]” (“七个有之”).  It is a typical example of the intertwining of political and economic problems and extreme corruption and degeneracy. It is a typical example of aggressively engaging in privileges, acting recklessly, and flagrantly violating discipline and law as enforcement is being tightened. Completely eradicating the toxic influence of Sun Lijun’s political gang is an inevitable requirement for ensuring that the “knife handle” is firmly in the hands of the Party and the people and is the top priority of politics and law organs for creating a clean and upright political ecology. We must deepen our understanding politically, and we must take the complete eradication of the poisonous influence as an urgent and serious political task.
Face square on the complexity of “detoxification.” Since the launch of efforts to earnestly eradicate the poison, relevant localities and units have attached great importance to it and achieved good results, but the task of “detoxification” is still formidable and complicated. Sun Lijun’s political gang is a cancer that seriously endangers the health of the Party’s whole. The poison has affected politics and law workers in certain localities and departments. We must keep a clear head and face square on the seriousness of the “toxic disease” and the breadth of “toxicity,” and resolutely avoid negative phenomena such as passing over issues prematurely, “turning a blind eye,” or responding unevenly.
Be committed to the thoroughness of “detoxification.” To eradicate the poisonous influence of Sun Lijun’s political gang, we must never just go where the wind takes us and must never act superficially; we must take swift, concrete, and sufficient action. Thought warnings must be up to par, using cases to interpret discipline and law, and creating an atmosphere of reflection, warning, and vigilance. Lead verification must be up to par, and we must dig deep regarding the problems mentioned in the Central Circular and regarding the leads to issues found in retrospective reviews and approvals of relevant units. The investigation and handling of “persons, matters, and cases” must be up to par. We must comprehensively investigate key personnel who have been in close contact with or have associated with Sun Lijun’s political gang, and we must severely investigate and deal with violations of discipline and law.
The most prominent task of political building work: To solve the problem of deficiencies in our systems, mechanisms and institutions, truly addressing shortcomings, strengthening points of weakness, plugging loopholes, and preventing risks
Draw lessons from the failures of that which proceeds us. To strengthen political building work, we must thoroughly analyze the deep-seated reasons for Sun Lijun’s political gang and the serious violations of discipline and law by leading politics and law cadres since the 18th Party Congress. We must pinpoint the crux of the problem, strengthen efforts to grasp the source and cure the root cause of problems, and effectively improve the systems, mechanisms, and institutions for comprehensively and strictly governing the Party and the police.
We must address “the weak sense of absolute Party leadership.” Adhering to the Party’s absolute leadership is the fundamental principle of politics and law work in the new era. For a period of time before now, some politics and law units have failed to diligently and satisfactorily study and implement the Regulations of the Chinese Communist Party on Politics and Law Work, and the systems for the Party’s absolute leadership have not been sufficiently sound. It is necessary to thoroughly implement the Regulations, comprehensively strengthen the Party’s leadership of politics and law work in terms of politics, ideology, organization and work style, implement it in all aspects and whole processes of politics and law work, and give full play to the leadership role of politics and law units’ Party committees (Party groups) in law enforcement and justice.
We must resolve the “erosion of ideals.” Ultimately, the corruption and degeneration of Party members and cadres is due to a decline of ideals and a wavering of beliefs. In times of peace, politics and law ranks must face not only “high winds and raging fires” but also many “temptations and traps.” The “master switch” of ideals and beliefs must be utterly unshakable. We must treat education on ideals and beliefs as a strategic initiative to consolidate the foundation, cultivate the mind, and forge the spirit. Guide politics and law cadres to diligently sweep away “ideological dust,” to think hard on “greed and desire,” and often vanquish the “thieves within our hearts.” Settle “political accounts, economic accounts, reputation accounts, accounts at home and within extended families, accounts of freedom, and health accounts” and from therein obtain powerful antibodies against erosion and degeneration and truly measure up to having rock-solid ideals and beliefs.
We must address “improper promotions.” Corruption and malpractice in the selection and deployment of people are akin to chronic toxicity, and the damage to the political ecology is systematic and long-term. We must strictly implement the Party’s policy on cadres, improve the systems for supervising, placing checks on, and pursuing accountability for personnel selection and deployment, and carry out retrospective investigations of “improper promotions.” Insist on putting political standards first and conduct in-depth and practical inspections of the political character of cadres, highlight good gatekeeping on politics and integrity, and implement a “one-vote veto” for those who are politically unqualified, using upright practices in the environment for using personnel to promote the good cleanly landscape of the political ecosystem.
We must resolve the “lack of supervision.” It is an iron law that power which lacks supervision inevitably leads to corruption. If supervision is properly maintained, once a nascent problem is identified, early warnings will be triggered, and it may be possible to make some politics and law cadres who have lost their way come to their senses, and rein in their horses at the precipice’s edge. To prevent the abuse of power, the key is to improve supervision and restriction mechanisms and form a synergy of supervision. We must strengthen supervision of leadership teams, especially “Number Ones.” “Number Ones” should not only accept supervision consciously but also pay attention to enforcing supervision. Enhance the political, up-to-date, principled, and combative nature of intra-party political life and improve capacity to discover and solve the problems of leadership teams themselves. Strictly implement the Central Committee’s Eight-Point Provisions, strengthen top-down supervision, make good use of internal inspections, resolutely eliminate the notion of privilege, and persevere in rectifying the “Four Malfeasances.”
We must resolve the dilemma of “attempting to confine cats within a cattle pen.” “Cats cannot be confined within a cattle pen”—with gaps that are too large, cats can come and go freely. Powers of law enforcement and judicial powers are highly specialized and discretionary; if the institutional cage is not tightly woven, corruption is unavoidable. We must take the comprehensive deepening of political and legal reform as the starting point, constantly improve the operation mechanisms of law enforcement and judicial powers and the restriction and supervision systems, and truly use an institutional cage to control power. Improve the list of powers and responsibilities for law enforcement and case handling, regularly conduct random checks, evaluations, and retrospective inspections on the quality of law enforcement and judicial cases, improve standardized management systems for people, property, and goods, and strictly prevent the use of power for personal gain. Strengthen the binding nature of system implementation, rigorously investigate and rectify problems such as arbitrary flexibility, malicious evasion, and disregard for the system, and strictly implement the “Ten Prohibitions” for politics and law workers in the new era so as to truly give teeth to and electrify the system.
We must resolve the problem of “weak accountability.” Without accountability, responsibility can easily become nothing but empty words, and responsibilities for the comprehensive and strict management of the Party and police will not be implemented well. Dare to hold people accountable, conscientiously implement the Accountability Regulations of the Chinese Communist Party, and in cases of weakened Party leadership, lack of Party building, and ineffectiveness in comprehensively and strictly governing the Party, comply with the principle that failures must be met with accountability and accountability must be strictly enforced. Excel in accountability, improve the mechanisms for initiating law enforcement and judicial accountability, lifelong accountability systems for the quality of case handling, retrospective accountability mechanisms for wrongful cases, and disciplinary mechanisms to ensure that law enforcement and judicial responsibilities are implemented concretely and that punishments can reach specific individuals.
The most thorough strategy for resolving root causes in political building: Continuously promote self-revolution on the politics and law front and ensure that the politics and law ranks do not deteriorate, decline, or degrade
Persistence in self-revolution is the second answer given by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core on how to break out of the historical cycle. Carrying out the education and rectification of the politics and law ranks is a beneficial exploration in Party self-revolution on the politics and law front in the new era. The politics and law front must thoroughly study and implement General Secretary Xi Jinping’s strategic thinking on self-revolution, consolidate and deepen the educational and rectification achievements of the politics and law ranks, unswervingly promote self-revolution, and forever maintain the loyal, pure, and reliable political character of the politics and law ranks.
We must strengthen the ideological consciousness and political initiative of self-revolution. The fight against corruption has won an overwhelming victory, but the fight never ends. At present, the soil that breeds corruption has not been completely eradicated, and formalism, bureaucratism, privileged thinking, and the phenomenon of privilege still exist. The outstanding problems existing in the politics and law ranks cannot be completely cured by a single centralized round of education and rectification and cannot be expected to be defeated in one battle. It is necessary to strengthen consciousness and initiative for self-revolution, combine centralized education and rectification with normalized solving of emerging problems, not only using strong measures to address prominent problems in a concentrated way but also frequently sweeping away ideological, organizational, disciplinary, and work style “dust.” We must work hard to treat minor illnesses and cure irregularities.
We must grasp the goals, requirements, and basic tasks of self-revolution. Be committed to self-purification, self-betterment, self-innovation, and self-improvement and forever maintain the Party’s advanced nature and purity so that the “knife handles” of politics and law never rust. Be committed to self-purification, maintain a high-pressure campaign against corruption, adhere to the tenets of no restricted areas, full coverage, and zero tolerance, investigate “two-faced people” who are disloyal and dishonest to the Party, thoroughly investigate law enforcement and judicial corruption, and strictly investigate corruption that has not be reined in since the 18th Party Congress so as to eliminate the black sheep and maintain the health of the politics and law ranks. Be committed to self-betterment, use systems to address shortcomings, strengthen points of weakness, plug loopholes, and prevent risks, and strive to ensure that we “do not dare, are not able, and do not want to be corrupt,” promoting these goals simultaneously. Be committed to self-innovation, resolutely eliminate all outdated ideological concepts and institutional ailments, resolutely rectify formalism and bureaucratism, and resolutely rectify unhealthy trends, especially stubborn diseases. Be committed to self-improvement, strengthen ideological tempering, political experience, practical exercise, and professional training and continuously improve the ability and quality of politics and law ranks.
Master the important principles and main strategies of self-revolution. Adhere to the unity of the Party’s leadership and the resolution of intra-party problems, the integration of organizational promotion and individual initiative, and the coordination of principled policy and strategic flexibility to promote a deepening and solidification of the concrete practice of self-revolution. Adhere to communication between upper and lower levels, integrate a strengthening of top-level design with encouragement for local exploration, strengthen Party leadership, pay attention to higher-level supervision and guidance, and build a communication mechanism of “supervising subordinates from above and pressing superiors from below” so as to achieve full-chain synergy and system-wide advancement. Adhere to the integration of leniency and strictness, pair “leniency in self-examination” with “strictness in investigation.” Guide by “leniency in self-examination” and enforce with “strictness in investigation.” Make coordinated use of the “Four Forms” to achieve the purpose of educating the vast majority and punishing the select few. Adhere to both breaking and establishing, combining the rectification of prominent problems with the establishment of rules and regulations, not only scraping poison from the bones but also treating the root causes. Excel at integrating effective innovative measures and raising them into institutional mechanisms. Adhere to mutual promotion internally and externally, combining self-revolution with supervision by the people, actively exploring new forms and new measures to receive supervision by the people, and wholeheartedly taking on the role of good public servants of the people, forever remaining loyal to the Party and never letting down the people.

The most urgent issue of political building work: thoroughly eliminate the toxic effects of Sun Lijun’s political gang and effectively optimize the political ecology of politics and law organs
The earnest investigation and punishment of Sun Lijun’s political gang fully demonstrates the firm determination of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core to comprehensively and strictly govern the Party.

The most thorough strategy for resolving root causes in political building: Continuously promote self-revolution on the politics and law front and ensure that the politics and law ranks do not deteriorate, decline, or degrade
Persistence in self-revolution is the second answer given by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core on how to break out of the historical cycle. Carrying out the education and rectification of the politics and law ranks is a beneficial exploration in Party self-revolution on the politics and law front in the new era. The politics and law front must thoroughly study and implement General Secretary Xi Jinping’s strategic thinking on self-revolution, consolidate and deepen the educational and rectification achievements of the politics and law ranks, unswervingly promote self-revolution, and forever maintain the loyal, pure, and reliable political character of the politics and law ranks.
We must strengthen the ideological consciousness and political initiative of self-revolution. The fight against corruption has won an overwhelming victory, but the fight never ends. At present, the soil that breeds corruption has not been completely eradicated, and formalism, bureaucratism, privileged thinking, and the phenomenon of privilege still exist. The outstanding problems existing in the politics and law ranks cannot be completely cured by a single centralized round of education and rectification and cannot be expected to be defeated in one battle. It is necessary to strengthen consciousness and initiative for self-revolution, combine centralized education and rectification with normalized solving of emerging problems, not only using strong measures to address prominent problems in a concentrated way but also frequently sweeping away ideological, organizational, disciplinary, and work style “dust.” We must work hard to treat minor illnesses and cure irregularities.
We must grasp the goals, requirements, and basic tasks of self-revolution. Be committed to self-purification, self-betterment, self-innovation, and self-improvement and forever maintain the Party’s advanced nature and purity so that the “knife handles” of politics and law never rust. Be committed to self-purification, maintain a high-pressure campaign against corruption, adhere to the tenets of no restricted areas, full coverage, and zero tolerance, investigate “two-faced people” who are disloyal and dishonest to the Party, thoroughly investigate law enforcement and judicial corruption, and strictly investigate corruption that has not be reined in since the 18th Party Congress so as to eliminate the black sheep and maintain the health of the politics and law ranks. Be committed to self-betterment, use systems to address shortcomings, strengthen points of weakness, plug loopholes, and prevent risks, and strive to ensure that we “do not dare, are not able, and do not want to be corrupt,” promoting these goals simultaneously. Be committed to self-innovation, resolutely eliminate all outdated ideological concepts and institutional ailments, resolutely rectify formalism and bureaucratism, and resolutely rectify unhealthy trends, especially stubborn diseases. Be committed to self-improvement, strengthen ideological tempering, political experience, practical exercise, and professional training and continuously improve the ability and quality of politics and law ranks.
Master the important principles and main strategies of self-revolution. Adhere to the unity of the Party’s leadership and the resolution of intra-party problems, the integration of organizational promotion and individual initiative, and the coordination of principled policy and strategic flexibility to promote a deepening and solidification of the concrete practice of self-revolution. Adhere to communication between upper and lower levels, integrate a strengthening of top-level design with encouragement for local exploration, strengthen Party leadership, pay attention to higher-level supervision and guidance, and build a communication mechanism of “supervising subordinates from above and pressing superiors from below” so as to achieve full-chain synergy and system-wide advancement. Adhere to the integration of leniency and strictness, pair “leniency in self-examination” with “strictness in investigation.” Guide by “leniency in self-examination” and enforce with “strictness in investigation.” Make coordinated use of the “Four Forms” to achieve the purpose of educating the vast majority and punishing the select few. Adhere to both breaking and establishing, combining the rectification of prominent problems with the establishment of rules and regulations, not only scraping poison from the bones but also treating the root causes. Excel at integrating effective innovative measures and raising them into institutional mechanisms. Adhere to mutual promotion internally and externally, combining self-revolution with supervision by the people, actively exploring new forms and new measures to receive supervision by the people, and wholeheartedly taking on the role of good public servants of the people, forever remaining loyal to the Party and never letting down the people.


Political building is the fundamental building work of the Party. Since the 18th Party Congress, General Secretary Xi Jinping has made a series of important expositions on strengthening political building, making original contributions to the development of Marxist party building ideas and providing the fundamental guidelines for advancing political building in the new era. Strengthening political building is an inevitable requirement for comprehensively and strictly governing the Party and the police, and it is an eternal and critical issue of the politics and law front. We must adhere to strengthening political building as the guide, deeply understand the decisive significance of the “Two Affirmations,” resolutely live up to the “Two Upholds,” forever maintain a political character of loyalty, cleanliness, and responsibility, and help “China’s governance” to create new miracles.
The most fundamental guide to political building work: Arm the mind with Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, strengthen the political consciousness of casting the soul and strengthening the body
Political resolve stems from theoretical clarity. Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is the latest achievement of the Sinification and modernization of Marxism, the essence for our times of Chinese culture and Chinese spirit, the ideological banner that guides the Chinese nation to grow strong, and the guide to action for the people of the nation to march towards the second centenary goal. We must treat studying deeply, understanding thoroughly, and putting into action Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as our own political requirements, work needs, and spiritual pursuits. We must strengthen the endogenous driving force for the study of the Party’s innovative theory and constantly seek practical results in the combination of “learning, understanding, research, and application.” We must take the lead in being firm believers, active disseminators, and faithful practitioners of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.
Be committed to the pairing of study with understanding to promote comprehension. Be committed to reading more of the original works, diligently studying original texts, and deeply understanding the principles, earnestly studying the significance, scientific system, essence, and practical requirements of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and deeply comprehending its original contribution to the Sinification and modernization of Marxism. Deeply understand the truth that when it comes to “why the Chinese Communist Party can, and why socialism with Chinese characteristics is good, ultimately, it is because Marxism is great.” Instill this in your mind and take this truth to heart.
Be committed to the pairing of study with research to promote deepening. Accurately grasp the Marxist epistemology contained in Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and continuously deepen understanding and research on the laws of the Communist Party’s governance, the laws of socialist construction, and the laws of the development of human society. Consciously use Marxist standpoints, viewpoints, and methods, deepen research on “the great matters of the nation” (国之大者), deepen research on major theoretical and practical issues in the field of politics and law, and better grasp the laws of politics and law work in the new era.
Be committed to the pairing of study with application to promote transformations. Promote the learning style of linking theory with practice and strive to transform achievements in studying and implementing Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era into political consciousness regarding strengthening the “Four Consciousnesses,” firming up the “Four Matters of Confidence,” and achieving the “Two Upholds.” Transform such achievements into innovative ideas for promoting the high-quality development of politics and law work. Transform such achievements into effective measures for promoting self-revolution on the politics and law front; and transform them into a strong capacity for preventing risks, ensuring security, and protecting stability, striving to build a higher level of security for China.
The most important requirements of political building: Resolutely achieving the “Two Upholds” and resolutely obeying the command of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core
The politics and law front must treat achieving the “Two Upholds” as the top priority of strengthening political building, implement this throughout all aspects and the whole process of performing duties and responsibilities, and resolutely safeguard General Secretary Xi Jinping’s status as the core of the Party Central Committee and the core of the whole party.
In terms of sentiment, wholeheartedly embrace the core. The Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core has led the whole Party and the people of the whole nation to usher in a new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, opening up a new realm of Sinification and modernization of Marxism, creating a new great cause to achieve the first centenary goal, and launching a new journey in the march towards the second centenary goal. The Chinese nation has ushered in a great leap, from standing up and becoming rich, to becoming strong. General Secretary Xi Jinping’s great prestige, leadership style, outstanding wisdom, charisma, and feelings for the people have become a huge spiritual force that inspires and motivates us. We sincerely feel that the fact that General Secretary Xi Jinping has become the popularly supported and well-deserved core of the Party, people’s leader, and commander-in-chief of the army is the great fortune of the Party, the country, and the people. We must always be loyally devoted to protecting the core and embracing the core.
Mentally, always keep close to the core. In the face of great changes unseen in a century, the closer we get to our goal, the more complex the situation and the more arduous the task, the more we need General Secretary Xi Jinping to be at the helm to navigate and the more we need the steadying role of the CCP Central Committee’s centralized and unified leadership. The politics and law front must unremittingly arm our minds with Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and make timely efforts to follow, study and implement General Secretary Xi Jinping’s new ideas, new thoughts, and new strategies, and fully understand what General Secretary Xi Jinping is concerned with and is emphasizing. We must consolidate the ideological foundation of aligning with the core and listening to the command of the Party Central Committee, ensuring that new-era politics and law work always moves ahead in the right direction as pointed out by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
Politically, remain absolutely loyal to the core. Building political loyalty is the primary task of building an invincible political and legal army. Achieving the “Two Upholds” is the most fundamental requirement of political loyalty. The politics and law front must treat achieving the “Two Upholds” as the basic political norm to abide by, as the fundamental political requirement to implement, and as the greatest political discipline and political rule to enforce. We must always maintain a high degree of consistency with the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core in terms of political position, political direction, political principles, and political path.
In action, resolutely defend the core. Being committed to achieving the “Two Upholds” means it is imperative to put them into action. The politics and law front must thoroughly implement the important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping and the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee. We must resolutely obey the orders of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core, ensuring that we resolutely respond to what the Party Central Committee advocates, resolutely comply with what the Party Central Committee decides, and resolutely put a stop to what the Party Central Committee prohibits. We must resolutely oppose words and actions that undermine the Party’s centralized, unified leadership, resolutely struggle against phenomena that affect the unity of the Party, and resolutely eradicate risks and hidden troubles that affect national political security.
The most urgent issue of political building work: thoroughly eliminate the toxic effects of Sun Lijun’s political gang and effectively optimize the political ecology of politics and law organs
The earnest investigation and punishment of Sun Lijun’s political gang fully demonstrates the firm determination of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core to comprehensively and strictly govern the Party. The politics and law front must be certain to completely eliminate the toxic influence of Sun Lijun’s political gang, use cases to warn, use cases to promote reform, and use cases to promote governance so as thoroughly “detoxify” and purify the political ecology of politics and law organs.
Recognize the critical nature of “detoxification.” Sun Lijun’s political gang is a typical example of disloyalty and dishonesty to the Party and the “Seven Presences [of Political Misbehaviours]” (“七个有之”).  It is a typical example of the intertwining of political and economic problems and extreme corruption and degeneracy. It is a typical example of aggressively engaging in privileges, acting recklessly, and flagrantly violating discipline and law as enforcement is being tightened. Completely eradicating the toxic influence of Sun Lijun’s political gang is an inevitable requirement for ensuring that the “knife handle” is firmly in the hands of the Party and the people and is the top priority of politics and law organs for creating a clean and upright political ecology. We must deepen our understanding politically, and we must take the complete eradication of the poisonous influence as an urgent and serious political task.
Face square on the complexity of “detoxification.” Since the launch of efforts to earnestly eradicate the poison, relevant localities and units have attached great importance to it and achieved good results, but the task of “detoxification” is still formidable and complicated. Sun Lijun’s political gang is a cancer that seriously endangers the health of the Party’s whole. The poison has affected politics and law workers in certain localities and departments. We must keep a clear head and face square on the seriousness of the “toxic disease” and the breadth of “toxicity,” and resolutely avoid negative phenomena such as passing over issues prematurely, “turning a blind eye,” or responding unevenly.
Be committed to the thoroughness of “detoxification.” To eradicate the poisonous influence of Sun Lijun’s political gang, we must never just go where the wind takes us and must never act superficially; we must take swift, concrete, and sufficient action. Thought warnings must be up to par, using cases to interpret discipline and law, and creating an atmosphere of reflection, warning, and vigilance. Lead verification must be up to par, and we must dig deep regarding the problems mentioned in the Central Circular and regarding the leads to issues found in retrospective reviews and approvals of relevant units. The investigation and handling of “persons, matters, and cases” must be up to par. We must comprehensively investigate key personnel who have been in close contact with or have associated with Sun Lijun’s political gang, and we must severely investigate and deal with violations of discipline and law.
The most prominent task of political building work: To solve the problem of deficiencies in our systems, mechanisms and institutions, truly addressing shortcomings, strengthening points of weakness, plugging loopholes, and preventing risks
Draw lessons from the failures of that which proceeds us. To strengthen political building work, we must thoroughly analyze the deep-seated reasons for Sun Lijun’s political gang and the serious violations of discipline and law by leading politics and law cadres since the 18th Party Congress. We must pinpoint the crux of the problem, strengthen efforts to grasp the source and cure the root cause of problems, and effectively improve the systems, mechanisms, and institutions for comprehensively and strictly governing the Party and the police.
We must address “the weak sense of absolute Party leadership.” Adhering to the Party’s absolute leadership is the fundamental principle of politics and law work in the new era. For a period of time before now, some politics and law units have failed to diligently and satisfactorily study and implement the Regulations of the Chinese Communist Party on Politics and Law Work, and the systems for the Party’s absolute leadership have not been sufficiently sound. It is necessary to thoroughly implement the Regulations, comprehensively strengthen the Party’s leadership of politics and law work in terms of politics, ideology, organization and work style, implement it in all aspects and whole processes of politics and law work, and give full play to the leadership role of politics and law units’ Party committees (Party groups) in law enforcement and justice.
We must resolve the “erosion of ideals.” Ultimately, the corruption and degeneration of Party members and cadres is due to a decline of ideals and a wavering of beliefs. In times of peace, politics and law ranks must face not only “high winds and raging fires” but also many “temptations and traps.” The “master switch” of ideals and beliefs must be utterly unshakable. We must treat education on ideals and beliefs as a strategic initiative to consolidate the foundation, cultivate the mind, and forge the spirit. Guide politics and law cadres to diligently sweep away “ideological dust,” to think hard on “greed and desire,” and often vanquish the “thieves within our hearts.” Settle “political accounts, economic accounts, reputation accounts, accounts at home and within extended families, accounts of freedom, and health accounts” and from therein obtain powerful antibodies against erosion and degeneration and truly measure up to having rock-solid ideals and beliefs.
We must address “improper promotions.” Corruption and malpractice in the selection and deployment of people are akin to chronic toxicity, and the damage to the political ecology is systematic and long-term. We must strictly implement the Party’s policy on cadres, improve the systems for supervising, placing checks on, and pursuing accountability for personnel selection and deployment, and carry out retrospective investigations of “improper promotions.” Insist on putting political standards first and conduct in-depth and practical inspections of the political character of cadres, highlight good gatekeeping on politics and integrity, and implement a “one-vote veto” for those who are politically unqualified, using upright practices in the environment for using personnel to promote the good cleanly landscape of the political ecosystem.
We must resolve the “lack of supervision.” It is an iron law that power which lacks supervision inevitably leads to corruption. If supervision is properly maintained, once a nascent problem is identified, early warnings will be triggered, and it may be possible to make some politics and law cadres who have lost their way come to their senses, and rein in their horses at the precipice’s edge. To prevent the abuse of power, the key is to improve supervision and restriction mechanisms and form a synergy of supervision. We must strengthen supervision of leadership teams, especially “Number Ones.” “Number Ones” should not only accept supervision consciously but also pay attention to enforcing supervision. Enhance the political, up-to-date, principled, and combative nature of intra-party political life and improve capacity to discover and solve the problems of leadership teams themselves. Strictly implement the Central Committee’s Eight-Point Provisions, strengthen top-down supervision, make good use of internal inspections, resolutely eliminate the notion of privilege, and persevere in rectifying the “Four Malfeasances.”
We must resolve the dilemma of “attempting to confine cats within a cattle pen.” “Cats cannot be confined within a cattle pen”—with gaps that are too large, cats can come and go freely. Powers of law enforcement and judicial powers are highly specialized and discretionary; if the institutional cage is not tightly woven, corruption is unavoidable. We must take the comprehensive deepening of political and legal reform as the starting point, constantly improve the operation mechanisms of law enforcement and judicial powers and the restriction and supervision systems, and truly use an institutional cage to control power. Improve the list of powers and responsibilities for law enforcement and case handling, regularly conduct random checks, evaluations, and retrospective inspections on the quality of law enforcement and judicial cases, improve standardized management systems for people, property, and goods, and strictly prevent the use of power for personal gain. Strengthen the binding nature of system implementation, rigorously investigate and rectify problems such as arbitrary flexibility, malicious evasion, and disregard for the system, and strictly implement the “Ten Prohibitions” for politics and law workers in the new era so as to truly give teeth to and electrify the system.
We must resolve the problem of “weak accountability.” Without accountability, responsibility can easily become nothing but empty words, and responsibilities for the comprehensive and strict management of the Party and police will not be implemented well. Dare to hold people accountable, conscientiously implement the Accountability Regulations of the Chinese Communist Party, and in cases of weakened Party leadership, lack of Party building, and ineffectiveness in comprehensively and strictly governing the Party, comply with the principle that failures must be met with accountability and accountability must be strictly enforced. Excel in accountability, improve the mechanisms for initiating law enforcement and judicial accountability, lifelong accountability systems for the quality of case handling, retrospective accountability mechanisms for wrongful cases, and disciplinary mechanisms to ensure that law enforcement and judicial responsibilities are implemented concretely and that punishments can reach specific individuals.
The most thorough strategy for resolving root causes in political building: Continuously promote self-revolution on the politics and law front and ensure that the politics and law ranks do not deteriorate, decline, or degrade
Persistence in self-revolution is the second answer given by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core on how to break out of the historical cycle. Carrying out the education and rectification of the politics and law ranks is a beneficial exploration in Party self-revolution on the politics and law front in the new era.

We must strengthen the ideological consciousness and political initiative of self-revolution. The fight against corruption has won an overwhelming victory, but the fight never ends. At present, the soil that breeds corruption has not been completely eradicated, and formalism, bureaucratism, privileged thinking, and the phenomenon of privilege still exist.

Be committed to self-purification, self-betterment, self-innovation, and self-improvement and forever maintain the Party’s advanced nature and purity so that the “knife handles” of politics and law never rust.

Be committed to self-betterment, use systems to address shortcomings, strengthen points of weakness, plug loopholes, and prevent risks, and strive to ensure that we “do not dare, are not able, and do not want to be corrupt,” promoting these goals simultaneously.

Be committed to self-improvement, strengthen ideological tempering, political experience, practical exercise, and professional training and continuously improve the ability and quality of politics and law ranks.
Master the important principles and main strategies of self-revolution. Adhere to the unity of the Party’s leadership and the resolution of intra-party problems, the integration of organizational promotion and individual initiative, and the coordination of principled policy and strategic flexibility to promote a deepening and solidification of the concrete practice of self-revolution. Adhere to communication between upper and lower levels, integrate a strengthening of top-level design with encouragement for local exploration, strengthen Party leadership, pay attention to higher-level supervision and guidance, and build a communication mechanism of “supervising subordinates from above and pressing superiors from below” so as to achieve full-chain synergy and system-wide advancement. Adhere to the integration of leniency and strictness, pair “leniency in self-examination” with “strictness in investigation.” Guide by “leniency in self-examination” and enforce with “strictness in investigation.” Make coordinated use of the “Four Forms” to achieve the purpose of educating the vast majority and punishing the select few. Adhere to both breaking and establishing, combining the rectification of prominent problems with the establishment of rules and regulations, not only scraping poison from the bones but also treating the root causes. Excel at integrating effective innovative measures and raising them into institutional mechanisms. Adhere to mutual promotion internally and externally, combining self-revolution with supervision by the people, actively exploring new forms and new measures to receive supervision by the people, and wholeheartedly taking on the role of good public servants of the people, forever remaining loyal to the Party and never letting down the people.

We must treat education on ideals and beliefs as a strategic initiative to consolidate the foundation, cultivate the mind, and forge the spirit. Guide politics and law cadres to diligently sweep away “ideological dust,” to think hard on “greed and desire,” and often vanquish the “thieves within our hearts.” Settle “political accounts, economic accounts, reputation accounts, accounts at home and within extended families, accounts of freedom, and health accounts” and from therein obtain powerful antibodies against erosion and degeneration and truly measure up to having rock-solid ideals and beliefs.
We must address “improper promotions.” Corruption and malpractice in the selection and deployment of people are akin to chronic toxicity, and the damage to the political ecology is systematic and long-term. We must strictly implement the Party’s policy on cadres, improve the systems for supervising, placing checks on, and pursuing accountability for personnel selection and deployment, and carry out retrospective investigations of “improper promotions.” Insist on putting political standards first and conduct in-depth and practical inspections of the political character of cadres, highlight good gatekeeping on politics and integrity, and implement a “one-vote veto” for those who are politically unqualified, using upright practices in the environment for using personnel to promote the good cleanly landscape of the political ecosystem.
We must resolve the “lack of supervision.” It is an iron law that power which lacks supervision inevitably leads to corruption. If supervision is properly maintained, once a nascent problem is identified, early warnings will be triggered, and it may be possible to make some politics and law cadres who have lost their way come to their senses, and rein in their horses at the precipice’s edge. To prevent the abuse of power, the key is to improve supervision and restriction mechanisms and form a synergy of supervision. We must strengthen supervision of leadership teams, especially “Number Ones.” “Number Ones” should not only accept supervision consciously but also pay attention to enforcing supervision. Enhance the political, up-to-date, principled, and combative nature of intra-party political life and improve capacity to discover and solve the problems of leadership teams themselves. Strictly implement the Central Committee’s Eight-Point Provisions, strengthen top-down supervision, make good use of internal inspections, resolutely eliminate the notion of privilege, and persevere in rectifying the “Four Malfeasances.”
We must resolve the dilemma of “attempting to confine cats within a cattle pen.” “Cats cannot be confined within a cattle pen”—with gaps that are too large, cats can come and go freely. Powers of law enforcement and judicial powers are highly specialized and discretionary; if the institutional cage is not tightly woven, corruption is unavoidable. We must take the comprehensive deepening of political and legal reform as the starting point, constantly improve the operation mechanisms of law enforcement and judicial powers and the restriction and supervision systems, and truly use an institutional cage to control power. Improve the list of powers and responsibilities for law enforcement and case handling, regularly conduct random checks, evaluations, and retrospective inspections on the quality of law enforcement and judicial cases, improve standardized management systems for people, property, and goods, and strictly prevent the use of power for personal gain. Strengthen the binding nature of system implementation, rigorously investigate and rectify problems such as arbitrary flexibility, malicious evasion, and disregard for the system, and strictly implement the “Ten Prohibitions” for politics and law workers in the new era so as to truly give teeth to and electrify the system.
We must resolve the problem of “weak accountability.” Without accountability, responsibility can easily become nothing but empty words, and responsibilities for the comprehensive and strict management of the Party and police will not be implemented well. Dare to hold people accountable, conscientiously implement the Accountability Regulations of the Chinese Communist Party, and in cases of weakened Party leadership, lack of Party building, and ineffectiveness in comprehensively and strictly governing the Party, comply with the principle that failures must be met with accountability and accountability must be strictly enforced. Excel in accountability, improve the mechanisms for initiating law enforcement and judicial accountability, lifelong accountability systems for the quality of case handling, retrospective accountability mechanisms for wrongful cases, and disciplinary mechanisms to ensure that law enforcement and judicial responsibilities are implemented concretely and that punishments can reach specific individuals.
The most thorough strategy for resolving root causes in political building: Continuously promote self-revolution on the politics and law front and ensure that the politics and law ranks do not deteriorate, decline, or degrade
Persistence in self-revolution is the second answer given by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as its core on how to break out of the historical cycle. Carrying out the education and rectification of the politics and law ranks is a beneficial exploration in Party self-revolution on the politics and law front in the new era. The politics and law front must thoroughly study and implement General Secretary Xi Jinping’s strategic thinking on self-revolution, consolidate and deepen the educational and rectification achievements of the politics and law ranks, unswervingly promote self-revolution, and forever maintain the loyal, pure, and reliable political character of the politics and law ranks.
We must strengthen the ideological consciousness and political initiative of self-revolution. The fight against corruption has won an overwhelming victory, but the fight never ends. At present, the soil that breeds corruption has not been completely eradicated, and formalism, bureaucratism, privileged thinking, and the phenomenon of privilege still exist. The outstanding problems existing in the politics and law ranks cannot be completely cured by a single centralized round of education and rectification and cannot be expected to be defeated in one battle. It is necessary to strengthen consciousness and initiative for self-revolution, combine centralized education and rectification with normalized solving of emerging problems, not only using strong measures to address prominent problems in a concentrated way but also frequently sweeping away ideological, organizational, disciplinary, and work style “dust.” We must work hard to treat minor illnesses and cure irregularities.
We must grasp the goals, requirements, and basic tasks of self-revolution. Be committed to self-purification, self-betterment, self-innovation, and self-improvement and forever maintain the Party’s advanced nature and purity so that the “knife handles” of politics and law never rust. Be committed to self-purification, maintain a high-pressure campaign against corruption, adhere to the tenets of no restricted areas, full coverage, and zero tolerance, investigate “two-faced people” who are disloyal and dishonest to the Party, thoroughly investigate law enforcement and judicial corruption, and strictly investigate corruption that has not be reined in since the 18th Party Congress so as to eliminate the black sheep and maintain the health of the politics and law ranks. Be committed to self-betterment, use systems to address shortcomings, strengthen points of weakness, plug loopholes, and prevent risks, and strive to ensure that we “do not dare, are not able, and do not want to be corrupt,” promoting these goals simultaneously. Be committed to self-innovation, resolutely eliminate all outdated ideological concepts and institutional ailments, resolutely rectify formalism and bureaucratism, and resolutely rectify unhealthy trends, especially stubborn diseases. Be committed to self-improvement, strengthen ideological tempering, political experience, practical exercise, and professional training and continuously improve the ability and quality of politics and law ranks.
Master the important principles and main strategies of self-revolution. Adhere to the unity of the Party’s leadership and the resolution of intra-party problems, the integration of organizational promotion and individual initiative, and the coordination of principled policy and strategic flexibility to promote a deepening and solidification of the concrete practice of self-revolution. Adhere to communication between upper and lower levels, integrate a strengthening of top-level design with encouragement for local exploration, strengthen Party leadership, pay attention to higher-level supervision and guidance, and build a communication mechanism of “supervising subordinates from above and pressing superiors from below” so as to achieve full-chain synergy and system-wide advancement. Adhere to the integration of leniency and strictness, pair “leniency in self-examination” with “strictness in investigation.” Guide by “leniency in self-examination” and enforce with “strictness in investigation.” Make coordinated use of the “Four Forms” to achieve the purpose of educating the vast majority and punishing the select few. Adhere to both breaking and establishing, combining the rectification of prominent problems with the establishment of rules and regulations, not only scraping poison from the bones but also treating the root causes. Excel at integrating effective innovative measures and raising them into institutional mechanisms. Adhere to mutual promotion internally and externally, combining self-revolution with supervision by the people, actively exploring new forms and new measures to receive supervision by the people, and wholeheartedly taking on the role of good public servants of the people, forever remaining loyal to the Party and never letting down the people.
