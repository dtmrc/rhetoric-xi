Acting in Solidarity for a Shared Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 16th G20 Leaders’ Summit,Xi Jinping,"Oct 30, 2021","Your Excellency Prime Minister Mario Draghi,Dear Colleagues, "
Acting in Solidarity for a Shared Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 16th G20 Leaders’ Summit,Xi Jinping,"Oct 30, 2021","I wish to begin by sincerely thanking Italy, the G20 President, for the great efforts it has made in hosting this Summit.  "
Acting in Solidarity for a Shared Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 16th G20 Leaders’ Summit,Xi Jinping,"Oct 30, 2021","The city of Rome, with its time-honored history, has left a splendid chapter in the history of human civilization. Today, we are meeting here against the backdrop of a protracted COVID-19 pandemic, fragile economic recovery, acute challenges of climate change, and frequent flare-ups of regional hotspot issues. With “People, Planet, Prosperity” as its theme, the Rome Summit gives expression to the resolve of the international community to act in solidarity to defeat the pandemic and revive the world economy, and demonstrates the mission of the G20 to lead the transformation of global economic governance.  "
Acting in Solidarity for a Shared Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 16th G20 Leaders’ Summit,Xi Jinping,"Oct 30, 2021","Faced with changes and a pandemic both unseen in a century, the G20, the premier forum for international economic cooperation, needs to shoulder its due responsibilities, bear in mind the future of humanity and the welfare of the people, uphold openness, inclusiveness and win-win cooperation, practice true multilateralism, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. To be specific, I would like to suggest that we work in the following five areas. "
Acting in Solidarity for a Shared Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 16th G20 Leaders’ Summit,Xi Jinping,"Oct 30, 2021","First, work in solidarity to combat COVID-19. With the coronavirus ravaging the whole world, none of us can stay safe on our own. Solidarity and cooperation are the most powerful weapon. The international community must work in concert to confront and defeat the pandemic with a science-based approach. Stigmatization of the virus and politicization of origins tracing run counter to the spirit of solidarity against the pandemic. We need to step up cooperation on prevention, control, diagnosis and treatment, and enhance preparedness for major public health emergencies. The G20 includes the world’s major economies and should therefore play a leading role in building consensus, mobilizing resources, and promoting cooperation.  "
Acting in Solidarity for a Shared Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 16th G20 Leaders’ Summit,Xi Jinping,"Oct 30, 2021","At the early stage of the pandemic, I called for COVID-19 vaccines to be made a global public good. On that basis, I would like to propose here a Global Vaccine Cooperation Action Initiative: First, we need to strengthen vaccine R&D cooperation and support vaccine companies in conducting joint R&D and production with developing countries. Second, we need to uphold equity and justice, and provide more vaccines to developing countries to meet the global vaccination target for 2022 as set by the World Health Organization (WHO). Third, we need to support the World Trade Organization (WTO) in making an early decision on waiving intellectual property rights on COVID-19 vaccines, and encourage vaccine companies to transfer technology to developing countries. Fourth, we need to scale up cross-border trade cooperation to ensure smooth trade in vaccines and related raw and auxiliary materials. Fifth, we need to treat different vaccines equally and advance mutual recognition of vaccines in accordance with the WHO’s Emergency Use Listing. Sixth, we need to provide financial support for global vaccine cooperation, especially for developing countries to access vaccines. "
Acting in Solidarity for a Shared Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 16th G20 Leaders’ Summit,Xi Jinping,"Oct 30, 2021","To date, China has provided over 1.6 billion doses of vaccines to more than 100 countries and international organizations, and will provide over two billion doses to the world in the course of this year. China is conducting joint vaccine production with 16 countries, with an initial capacity of 700 million doses per year. The International Forum on COVID-19 Vaccine Cooperation that I proposed last May at the Global Health Summit was held successfully in August. The participating countries reached intended deals of over 1.5 billion doses for this year. China, together with 30 other countries, has also launched an Initiative for Belt and Road Partnership on COVID-19 Vaccines Cooperation, calling on the international community to promote fair distribution of vaccines around the world. China is ready to work with all parties to enhance vaccine accessibility and affordability in developing countries and make positive contribution to building a global line of defense through vaccination. "
Acting in Solidarity for a Shared Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 16th G20 Leaders’ Summit,Xi Jinping,"Oct 30, 2021","Second, strengthen coordination to promote recovery. COVID-19 has made a complex and far-reaching impact on the world economy. It is imperative that we apply the right prescriptions to address both symptoms and root causes of the problems we face. We should step up macroeconomic policy coordination and ensure the continuity, consistency and sustainability of our policies. Major economies should adopt responsible macroeconomic policies, prevent measures taken for themselves from entailing rising inflation, exchange rate fluctuations or mounting debts, avoid negative spillovers on developing countries, and ensure sound operation of the international economic and financial system. "
Acting in Solidarity for a Shared Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 16th G20 Leaders’ Summit,Xi Jinping,"Oct 30, 2021","At the same time, we should take a long-term perspective, improve the global economic governance system and rules, and make up for the relevant governance deficit. We should continue to push for the scheduled conclusion of the 16th General Quota Review of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to buttress the global financial safety net. China supports the early launch of negotiations on the 20th replenishment process of the International Development Association, and maintains that the relevant Voting Rights Review should faithfully reflect the changes in the international economic landscape and raise the voice of developing countries. China welcomes the IMF’s decision on the new allocation of Special Drawing Rights totaling 650 billion US dollars, and stands ready to lend the new allocation to low-income countries that are seriously affected by COVID-19. "
Acting in Solidarity for a Shared Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 16th G20 Leaders’ Summit,Xi Jinping,"Oct 30, 2021","We should safeguard the multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core and build an open world economy. The G20 should continue to provide political guidance on the reform of the WTO, uphold its core values and basic principles, and protect developing countries’ rights, interests and development space. It is imperative to restore, as quickly as possible, the normal operation of the dispute settlement mechanism, and work for positive results at the 12th WTO Ministerial Conference. We should keep the industrial and supply chains safe and stable, and ensure the smooth functioning of the world economy. China proposes to hold an international forum on resilient and stable industrial and supply chains, and welcomes the active participation of G20 members and relevant international organizations. "
Acting in Solidarity for a Shared Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 16th G20 Leaders’ Summit,Xi Jinping,"Oct 30, 2021","Infrastructure development plays an important role in propelling economic growth. China has made unremitting efforts in this regard through Belt and Road cooperation and other initiatives. China is prepared to work with all sides to uphold the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, stay committed to the vision of open, green and clean cooperation, and pursue the goal of high-standard, people-centered and sustainable development, so as to deliver more fruitful outcomes from high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. "
Acting in Solidarity for a Shared Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 16th G20 Leaders’ Summit,Xi Jinping,"Oct 30, 2021","Third, embrace inclusiveness to achieve common development. The pandemic has brought multiple crises to the world, developing countries in particular. The number of people living in hunger has reached around 800 million. Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is facing unprecedented challenges. In this context, we must take a people-centered approach and make global development more equitable, effective and inclusive, so that no country will be left behind. "
Acting in Solidarity for a Shared Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 16th G20 Leaders’ Summit,Xi Jinping,"Oct 30, 2021","The G20 should prioritize development in macro policy coordination, ensure sound implementation of the Action Plan on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, move forward with the Initiative on Supporting Industrialization in Africa and Least Developed Countries, and promote synergy among the existing mechanisms for development cooperation. Advanced economies should fulfill their pledges on official development assistance (ODA) and provide more resources for developing countries. "
Acting in Solidarity for a Shared Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 16th G20 Leaders’ Summit,Xi Jinping,"Oct 30, 2021","Not long ago, I proposed a Global Development Initiative at the United Nations and called on the international community to strengthen cooperation in areas of poverty alleviation, food security, COVID-19 response and vaccines, development financing, climate change and green development, industrialization, digital economy and connectivity, so as to accelerate implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and achieve more robust, greener and more balanced global development. This initiative is highly compatible with the G20’s goal and priority of promoting global development. We welcome the active participation of more countries in the initiative. "
Acting in Solidarity for a Shared Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 16th G20 Leaders’ Summit,Xi Jinping,"Oct 30, 2021","Fourth, pursue innovation to tap growth potential. Innovation is a decisive factor in promoting economic and social development and in addressing the common challenges to humanity. The G20 should join forces to unleash the potential for innovation-driven growth and draw up rules based on extensive participation and broad-based consensus to foster an enabling environment for innovation-driven development. Forming exclusive blocs or even drawing ideological lines will only cause division and create more obstacles, which will do no good but only harm to scientific and technological innovation. "
Acting in Solidarity for a Shared Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 16th G20 Leaders’ Summit,Xi Jinping,"Oct 30, 2021","Digital economy is an important frontier of scientific and technological innovation. The G20 should shoulder responsibilities in the digital era, quicken the development of new types of digital infrastructure, promote deeper integration of digital technologies with the real economy, and help developing countries eliminate the digital divide. China has put forth the Global Initiative on Data Security. We may discuss and develop international rules for digital governance that reflect the will and respect the interests of all sides, and actively foster an open, fair, just and non-discriminatory environment for digital development. China attaches great importance to international cooperation on digital economy, and has decided to apply to join the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement. China stands ready to work with all parties for the healthy and orderly development of digital economy. "
Acting in Solidarity for a Shared Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 16th G20 Leaders’ Summit,Xi Jinping,"Oct 30, 2021","Fifth, promote harmonious co-existence to achieve green and sustainable development. The G20 needs to uphold the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, push for the full implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change, and support a successful COP26 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and COP15 to the Convention on Biological Diversity. Developed countries need to lead by example on emissions reduction, fully accommodate the special difficulties and concerns of developing countries, deliver on their commitments of climate financing, and provide technology, capacity-building and other support for developing countries. This is critically important for the success of the upcoming COP26. "
Acting in Solidarity for a Shared Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 16th G20 Leaders’ Summit,Xi Jinping,"Oct 30, 2021","China has all along undertaken due international responsibilities commensurate with its national conditions. We have actively advanced the green transition of our economy, and raised the ambition of our climate actions on our own initiative. In the past ten years, China phased out 120 million kilowatts of installed coal-fired power generation capacity. The construction of the first batch of wind and photovoltaic power stations with a total installed capacity of about 100 million kilowatts was launched in an orderly fashion. China will strive to peak its CO2 emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. We will honor our words with actions and work with all countries to pursue a path of green, low-carbon and sustainable development.  "
Acting in Solidarity for a Shared Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 16th G20 Leaders’ Summit,Xi Jinping,"Oct 30, 2021","Colleagues,  "
Acting in Solidarity for a Shared Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 16th G20 Leaders’ Summit,Xi Jinping,"Oct 30, 2021","As an ancient Chinese philosopher observed, “He who has credibility connects the world.” In other words, credibility is the foundation for interactions with the world. China will stay committed to the fundamental state policy of opening-up to unleash the potential of its huge market and enormous domestic demand. We will promote institutional opening-up that covers rules, regulations, management and standards, and step up protection of intellectual property rights. We will continue to foster a business environment that is based on market principles, governed by law and up to international standards, and ensure a fair and equitable market order for both domestic and foreign companies. I am convinced that China’s development will bring even greater and new opportunities to the world and inject still more new impetus to the world economy.  "
Acting in Solidarity for a Shared Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 16th G20 Leaders’ Summit,Xi Jinping,"Oct 30, 2021","As the saying goes, Rome wasn’t built in a day. To build a community with a shared future for mankind requires persisting efforts of all countries. Although the journey ahead may be long and arduous, with sustained actions, we will eventually reach our destination and embrace a brighter future. Let us work together to dispel the dark clouds of the pandemic at an early date and jointly build an ever better future for all of us!  "
Acting in Solidarity for a Shared Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 16th G20 Leaders’ Summit,Xi Jinping,"Oct 30, 2021",Thank you.

To this end, I wish to make five proposals."
Advance BRICS Cooperation to Meet Common Challenges Together: Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 13th BRICS Summit,Xi Jinping,"Sep 9, 2021","First, strengthen public health cooperation in the spirit of solidarity. We need to step up to our political responsibility, support each other’s COVID response, and share relevant information and COVID control experience.

The political and legal affairs team is the team that has contributed the most and sacrificed the most in the era of peace. This special team must be given special care so it will be politically motivated, enthusiastic in its work, have its remuneration guaranteed, and receive humane care. We must do everything possible to help solve various practical difficulties so that cadres and police officers can be safe, secure, and free of worry. "

Bolstering Confidence and Jointly Overcoming Difficulties To Build a Better World,Xi Jinping,"Sep 21, 2021","First, we must beat COVID-19 and win this decisive fight crucial to the future of humanity. The history of world civilization is also one of fighting pandemics.

Recent developments in the global situation show once again that military intervention from the outside and so-called democratic transformation entail nothing but harm.

Building on Past Achievements and Launching a New Journey for Global Climate Actions – Statement by Xi Jinping at the Climate Ambition Summit,Xi Jinping,"Dec 12, 2020","Dear Colleagues, "
Building on Past Achievements and Launching a New Journey for Global Climate Actions – Statement by Xi Jinping at the Climate Ambition Summit,Xi Jinping,"Dec 12, 2020","It gives me great pleasure to join you in this Climate Ambition Summit. Five years ago, world leaders showed utmost political resolve and wisdom and adopted the Paris Agreement on climate change. Since then, the implementation of the Paris Agreement has received extensive international support and participation. At present, the international landscape is evolving more rapidly and COVID-19 is triggering deep reflections on the relationship between man and nature. The future of global climate governance is drawing greater attention. In this context, I wish to make three proposals: "
Building on Past Achievements and Launching a New Journey for Global Climate Actions – Statement by Xi Jinping at the Climate Ambition Summit,Xi Jinping,"Dec 12, 2020","First, we need to close ranks and make new advances in climate governance that features cooperation and win-win. In meeting the climate challenge, no one can be aloof and unilateralism will get us nowhere. Only by upholding multilateralism, unity and cooperation can we deliver shared benefits and win-win for all nations. China welcomes all countries’ support for the Paris Agreement and their greater contribution to tackling climate change. "
Building on Past Achievements and Launching a New Journey for Global Climate Actions – Statement by Xi Jinping at the Climate Ambition Summit,Xi Jinping,"Dec 12, 2020","Second, we need to raise ambition and foster a new architecture of climate governance where every party does its part. Following the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, all countries need to maximize actions in light of their respective national circumstances and capabilities. At the same time, developed countries need to scale up support for developing countries in financing, technology and capacity building. "
Building on Past Achievements and Launching a New Journey for Global Climate Actions – Statement by Xi Jinping at the Climate Ambition Summit,Xi Jinping,"Dec 12, 2020","Third, we need to boost confidence and pursue a new approach to climate governance that highlights green recovery. Mountains and rivers green are mountains of silver and gold. It is important to encourage green, low-carbon ways of life and production, and seek development opportunities and impetus from green development. "
Building on Past Achievements and Launching a New Journey for Global Climate Actions – Statement by Xi Jinping at the Climate Ambition Summit,Xi Jinping,"Dec 12, 2020",China has made important contributions to adopting the Paris Agreement and has made active efforts toward implementing it. I announced in September that China would scale up its nationally determined contributions and adopt more vigorous policies and measures. We aim to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060.  
Building on Past Achievements and Launching a New Journey for Global Climate Actions – Statement by Xi Jinping at the Climate Ambition Summit,Xi Jinping,"Dec 12, 2020","Today, I wish to announce some further commitments for 2030: China will lower its carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by over 65 percent from the 2005 level, increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 25 percent, increase the forest stock volume by 6 billion cubic meters from the 2005 level, and bring its total installed capacity of wind and solar power to over 1.2 billion kilowatts.  "
Building on Past Achievements and Launching a New Journey for Global Climate Actions – Statement by Xi Jinping at the Climate Ambition Summit,Xi Jinping,"Dec 12, 2020","China always honors its commitments. Guided by our new development philosophy, we will promote greener economic and social development in all respects while pursuing high-quality development. We will take solid steps to implement the targets just announced, and contribute even more to tackling the global climate challenge. "

Let us build on past achievements, work together to make steady progress in implementing the Paris Agreement, and launch a new journey for global climate actions. "

It has stood the test of time and become a major constructive force in the Eurasian region and global affairs. Committed to the Shanghai Spirit, SCO members have enhanced cooperation in the political, economic, security, people-to-people and cultural fields, setting an example for a new type of international relations that features mutual respect, equity, justice and win-win cooperation. In the face of COVID-19, we have backed each other up to tide over the difficulties together. Such solidarity has injected positive energy into both the SCO’s steady development and international cooperation against the coronavirus. "

Carrying Forward the Shanghai Spirit and Deepening Solidarity and Collaboration for a Stronger Community with a Shared Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 20th Meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization,Xi Jinping,"Nov 10, 2020","Ancient Chinese teachings tell us that “men of insight see the trend, while men of wisdom ride it”. Humanity lives in a global village where the interests and destinies of all countries are intertwined. People across the world increasingly yearn for a better life. The trend toward peace, development, cooperation and mutual benefit is unstoppable. History has proven and will continue to prove that good-neighborliness will prevail over a beggar-thy-neighbor approach, mutually beneficial cooperation will replace zero-sum game, and multilateralism will win over unilateralism. "
Carrying Forward the Shanghai Spirit and Deepening Solidarity and Collaboration for a Stronger Community with a Shared Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 20th Meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization,Xi Jinping,"Nov 10, 2020","In the current circumstances, the SCO is required to carry forward the Shanghai Spirit and deepen solidarity and collaboration.

Carrying Forward the Shanghai Spirit and Deepening Solidarity and Collaboration for a Stronger Community with a Shared Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 20th Meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization,Xi Jinping,"Nov 10, 2020","First, we need to step up anti-epidemic cooperation and build a community of health for us all. Right now, COVID-19 is still presenting an ongoing threat. To fight the virus that respects no borders, we must take up the most powerful weapon of solidarity and cooperation, and rise up to the most imperative task of saving people’s lives. "
Carrying Forward the Shanghai Spirit and Deepening Solidarity and Collaboration for a Stronger Community with a Shared Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 20th Meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization,Xi Jinping,"Nov 10, 2020","We need to strengthen our joint response to COVID-19, support each other’s containment efforts, and uphold regional and global public health security. We need to support the World Health Organization’s crucial leadership role, oppose attempts to politicize the pandemic or mislabel the coronavirus, and jointly resist any “political virus”. We need to put the SCO’s health cooperation mechanisms into full use, and deepen exchanges and cooperation in epidemic monitoring, scientific research, and disease control and treatment. China proposes that hotline contacts be created between SCO members’ centers for disease control (CDCs) for timely updates on cross-border transmission of communicable diseases. The unique value and important role of traditional medicine has been highlighted in the battle against COVID-19, and we need to continue to hold the SCO Forum on Traditional Medicine to deepen exchanges and mutual learning in this field. Vaccines play a vital role in defeating the virus. China has joined the COVAX facility, and will actively consider SCO countries’ need for vaccines to help protect people’s safety and health in our countries. "
Carrying Forward the Shanghai Spirit and Deepening Solidarity and Collaboration for a Stronger Community with a Shared Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 20th Meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization,Xi Jinping,"Nov 10, 2020","Second, we need to safeguard security and stability and build a community of security for us all.

We need to act on the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, address all forms of threats and challenges effectively, and foster a sound security environment in our region. "
Carrying Forward the Shanghai Spirit and Deepening Solidarity and Collaboration for a Stronger Community with a Shared Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 20th Meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization,Xi Jinping,"Nov 10, 2020","We need to firmly support countries concerned in their law-based efforts to steadily advance major domestic political agenda, firmly support countries in safeguarding political security and social stability, and firmly oppose interference by external forces in the domestic affairs of SCO members under whatever pretexts. We need to deepen solidarity and mutual trust, and resolve disputes and differences through dialogue and consultation, in order to cement the political foundation for SCO development. It is important that we forestall terrorist, separatist and extremist attempts to exploit the pandemic for disruption, curb the proliferation of drugs, crack down on Internet-based propagation of extremist ideology, and deepen SCO members’ law-enforcement cooperation. It is important that we uphold bio-security, data security and outer-space security, and engage in active communication and dialogue in this field. China has launched the Global Initiative on Data Security, which aims to galvanize efforts to shape a peaceful, secure, open, cooperative and orderly cyberspace. We welcome the participation of all parties in this Initiative. The situation in Afghanistan involves the security and stability in the wider region. We need to make good use of the SCO-Afghanistan Contact Group to help the country realize peace and reconstruction. "

Carrying Forward the Shanghai Spirit and Deepening Solidarity and Collaboration for a Stronger Community with a Shared Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 20th Meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization,Xi Jinping,"Nov 10, 2020","We need to forge greater synergy of the Belt and Road Initiative with national development strategies as well as region-wide cooperation initiatives such as the Eurasian Economic Union. We need to enhance connectivity and further integrate our industrial, supply and value chains for unimpeded economic circulation in the region. We need to facilitate reopening of economic activities through the “fast track” that steps up mobility of people and the “green lane” that quickens the flow of goods. We need to foster an open, fair and nondiscriminatory business environment for each other’s companies, and expand mutual investment among us. We need to seize opportunities from the new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation to step up cooperation in digital economy, e-commerce, artificial intelligence and smart cities. Next year, China will host a China-SCO forum on the digital economy industry in Chongqing, which will provide a platform for innovation cooperation among parties. We need to put the people first, and implement more joint projects that deliver real benefits to them. China supports setting up an SCO joint working group on poverty reduction and stands ready to share our good experience with other parties.  "

We may support the Organization’s exchanges and cooperation in education, culture, sports, media and women’s welfare, and institute an all-round, multi-channel structure of deeper cooperation. China will host an SCO non-governmental friendship forum next year, and will continue to hold SCO Youth Campus events, to which 600 young people will be invited in the coming three years, to deepen mutual understanding among the younger generation and bring them closer together.  "

Carrying Forward the Shanghai Spirit and Deepening Solidarity and Collaboration for a Stronger Community with a Shared Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 20th Meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization,Xi Jinping,"Nov 10, 2020","Colleagues,  "
Carrying Forward the Shanghai Spirit and Deepening Solidarity and Collaboration for a Stronger Community with a Shared Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 20th Meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization,Xi Jinping,"Nov 10, 2020","China cannot be separated from the world in achieving development, and the world also needs China for prosperity. Now, China is speeding up efforts to foster a new development paradigm with domestic circulation as the mainstay and domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other. New mechanisms are being put in place to build an open economy of a higher standard. China will remain committed to a win-win strategy of opening-up. It will seek development impetus from the world and contribute more to the world with its own development. We welcome all parties to capitalize on China’s development opportunity and make active endeavors to deepen cooperation with China. "
Carrying Forward the Shanghai Spirit and Deepening Solidarity and Collaboration for a Stronger Community with a Shared Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 20th Meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization,Xi Jinping,"Nov 10, 2020","China congratulates President Emomali Rahmon on taking over the chairmanship of the SCO Council of Heads of State, and will give full support to Tajikistan during its presidency. Next year, we will celebrate the 20th anniversary of the SCO. Let us hold high the banner of the Shanghai Spirit, forge ahead with strong cooperation, strive for the better development of our Organization, and build an even closer community with a shared future for us all. "
Carrying Forward the Shanghai Spirit and Deepening Solidarity and Collaboration for a Stronger Community with a Shared Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 20th Meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization,Xi Jinping,"Nov 10, 2020",Thank you. 
Comrade Xi Jinping’s Remarks to the Eighth Collective Study Session of the CCP Politburo,Xi Jinping,"Jul 30, 2013","Today, the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) held its eighth collective study session, whose study content was an investigation into the building of a maritime superpower.  Just now, the explanations by Zeng Heng, the deputy chief engineer of China National Offshore Oil Corporation and an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, and researcher Gao Zhiguo, director of the Institute of Ocean Development Strategy of the State Oceanic Administration as well as the discussion and speeches by the comrades were very good. After listening to it, I was very inspired. Next, I will discuss a few points learned from study. "
Comrade Xi Jinping’s Remarks to the Eighth Collective Study Session of the CCP Politburo,Xi Jinping,"Jul 30, 2013","The ocean is an important base for strategic resources, and there is huge potential for the exploitation of the world’s marine resources. In the 21st century, mankind has entered a period of large-scale development and utilization of the ocean. The ocean plays an even more important role in the country’s pattern of economic development and opening to the outside world. Its role in safeguarding national sovereignty, security, and development interests has increased in prominence, its role in the construction of the nation’s ecological civilization has become more significant, and its strategic position in international political, economic, military, and technological competition has also risen significantly. "
Comrade Xi Jinping’s Remarks to the Eighth Collective Study Session of the CCP Politburo,Xi Jinping,"Jul 30, 2013","Throughout history, the development of great powers has been inseparably linked to the ocean. Some people say “The strong of the world are inevitably the victors at sea, while the weak of the world are necessarily weak at sea” (强于天下者必胜于海，衰于天下者必弱于海). For example, after the industrial revolution in the mid-18th century, some Western nations relied on advanced ocean navigation technology to open up sea routes, expand overseas colonies, control world trade, and plunder world resources, creating the important conditions that allowed them to become world powers. "
Comrade Xi Jinping’s Remarks to the Eighth Collective Study Session of the CCP Politburo,Xi Jinping,"Jul 30, 2013","The Chinese nation was one of the first nations to make use of the ocean. As early as the Spring and Autumn Period, our ancestors first conceptualized a primitive idea of sea power. At that time, Qi was called the “Land of Sea Kings”. Guan Zhong, the Chancellor of Qi, proposed the idea of a government monopoly on the “resources of the mountains and the sea” (唯官山海为可耳, state monopoly on mineral and maritime resources). He said that, if the state organizes the development of land and sea resources in a unified manner, the country can become prosperous and strong. Long ago, our ancestors opened up the “Maritime Silk Road” for communication between the East and the West. For over a thousand years, China and other countries around the world have been able to communicate with each other through maritime trade and cultural exchanges. Chinese civilization also expanded to other parts of the world along these trade routes. In the first half of the 15th century, the seven voyages of Zheng He to the Western Ocean were one of the great maritime feats in human history. "
Comrade Xi Jinping’s Remarks to the Eighth Collective Study Session of the CCP Politburo,Xi Jinping,"Jul 30, 2013","After the mid-Ming Dynasty, when the world entered the age of exploration and the West established its maritime hegemony, China’s feudal dynasty adopted a closed-door policy. Its economic and technological development was slow, and overall national power was gradually declining. During and after the Opium Wars, most of the invasions of China by Western powers came from the sea. Continuous invasion by Western powers gradually turned China into a semicolonial and semi-feudal country. "
Comrade Xi Jinping’s Remarks to the Eighth Collective Study Session of the CCP Politburo,Xi Jinping,"Jul 30, 2013","Historical experience tells us that orienting to the ocean will lead to prosperity, while abandoning the ocean will lead to decline. A strong country is a strong maritime power, and a weak country is a weak maritime power. "
Comrade Xi Jinping’s Remarks to the Eighth Collective Study Session of the CCP Politburo,Xi Jinping,"Jul 30, 2013","China is both a major land power and a major sea power. We have more than 18,000 kilometers of continental coastline, over 14,000 kilometers of island coastline, claim over 3 million square kilometers of jurisdictional waters, and have extensive maritime strategic interests. How the marine industry develops and whether marine issues are resolved well or not are linked to the survival and development of our nation as well as the rise and fall, security or danger of our country. "
Comrade Xi Jinping’s Remarks to the Eighth Collective Study Session of the CCP Politburo,Xi Jinping,"Jul 30, 2013","The party and the State have long placed a great emphasis on marine work and the development of marine undertakings. The 18th Party Congress made a major deployment for the building of a maritime superpower. This is a strategic choice made by our Party after accurately grasping the characteristics of the times and world trends, objectively analyzing the features of the development process and stage of China’s marine industry, and making overall plans for the overall situation. The implementation of this major deployment is of great and far-reaching significance for promoting sustained and healthy economic development, safeguarding national sovereignty, security, and development interests, and realizing the goal of establishing a well-off society in an all-round way and thus achieving the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. "
Comrade Xi Jinping’s Remarks to the Eighth Collective Study Session of the CCP Politburo,Xi Jinping,"Jul 30, 2013","After years of development, China has established a relatively complete marine industry system, achieved major breakthroughs in marine science and technology, continuously enhanced marine resource development capabilities, gradual improved marine laws and regulations, completed the preliminary establishment of a comprehensive marine management system, and significantly enhanced the maintenance of marine rights and interests. On the whole, the marine industry has entered its best period of development in our history. These achievements have laid a solid foundation for our construction of a maritime superpower. "
Comrade Xi Jinping’s Remarks to the Eighth Collective Study Session of the CCP Politburo,Xi Jinping,"Jul 30, 2013","How should China approach the construction of a maritime superpower? This problem not only concerns us, but the international community as a whole. Some say that China’s promotion of the construction of a maritime superpower will make it into a new maritime hegemon, affecting regional stability and world peace. This worry is completely unnecessary! We will never follow the old path of colonization and plunder like some major powers in history. That path runs counter to the general trend of peaceful world development and it does not conform to the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation. We adhere to the development path of sea-based national prosperity, sea-based national strength, harmony between man and the sea, and mutually beneficial cooperation. We will achieve the goal of building a maritime superpower through peaceful, development-oriented, cooperative, and mutually beneficial methods. "
Comrade Xi Jinping’s Remarks to the Eighth Collective Study Session of the CCP Politburo,Xi Jinping,"Jul 30, 2013","We must follow the development trends of international maritime affairs, focus on the overall development of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, coordinate the overall domestic and international situations, adhere to land and sea coordination, and steadily promote the building of a maritime superpower. "
Comrade Xi Jinping’s Remarks to the Eighth Collective Study Session of the CCP Politburo,Xi Jinping,"Jul 30, 2013","First, we will improve the development of marine resources and focus on promoting the transformation of the marine economy to a quality and efficient type. A developed marine economy is an important support for the construction of a maritime superpower. The marine economy has become one of the most dynamic and promising areas of economic growth for coastal countries. The development of the Chinese marine economy has made great achievements, but compared with developed countries, the scale of our economy is small, its degree of development and intensity of utilization of marine resources is not high, and the development methods are still relatively unrefined. We must improve our marine development capabilities, expand the field of marine development, and make the marine economy a new point of growth. "
Comrade Xi Jinping’s Remarks to the Eighth Collective Study Session of the CCP Politburo,Xi Jinping,"Jul 30, 2013","It is necessary to strengthen marine industry planning and guidance, optimize the structure of the marine industry, improve the quality of marine economic growth, and focus on the development and utilization of marine biological resources, seawater utilization, the marine shipbuilding industry, marine oil and gas, mineral resource exploration and exploitation, marine transportation, marine tourism, and other industries. We must implement major special projects for marine engineering and equipment, improve deep-sea exploration, development, and load-carrying capacity, cultivate and expand strategic emerging marine industries, increase the contribution rate of the marine industry to economic growth, strive to make the marine industry a pillar industry of the national economy, and contribute to the assurance of national energy security, food security, and water resources security."
Comrade Xi Jinping’s Remarks to the Eighth Collective Study Session of the CCP Politburo,Xi Jinping,"Jul 30, 2013","Second, we will protect the marine ecological environment and strive to promote the conversion of marine development methods to recycling and reuse type. Currently, the situation of China’s coastal ecological environment is not promising, and environmental problems such as marine pollution and marine disasters are becoming increasingly apparent. If this problem is not solved well, not only will it impact sustainable economic and social development, but it will also impact social stability. We must resolutely take measures to curb the deterioration of the marine ecological environment with all our strength to significantly improve China’s marine ecological environment, allow the people to eat green, safe, and worry-free marine products, and enjoy the blue sea, blue sky, and clean beaches. "
Comrade Xi Jinping’s Remarks to the Eighth Collective Study Session of the CCP Politburo,Xi Jinping,"Jul 30, 2013","We must incorporate the construction of a marine ecological civilization into the overall layout of marine development, adhere to the principle of placing an equal emphasis on development and protection while performing pollution prevention and ecological restoration at the same time, scientifically and rationally develop and utilize marine resources, and maintain the natural reproduction capabilities of the marine environment. We must establish a total control system for marine pollution to effectively control the discharge of land-sourced pollutants into the sea at their sources. We must improve the environmental impact assessment system for marine engineering, resolutely exercise control based on environmental impact assessment results, and absolutely prevent the implementation of projects that seriously damage the marine environment. We must formulate coastline protection and utilization plans as soon as possible, strictly control land reclamation projects, protect coastal wetlands, and seriously investigate and deal with “three-sided projects” (三边工程), with simultaneous application, approval, and construction, as well as the practices of subdivision (化整为零) and ultra vires approval (越权审批). We must speed up the establishment of marine ecological compensation and ecological damage compensation systems, carry out marine restoration projects, promote the construction of marine nature reserves, and improve the emergency response mechanisms for marine environmental emergencies. "
Comrade Xi Jinping’s Remarks to the Eighth Collective Study Session of the CCP Politburo,Xi Jinping,"Jul 30, 2013","Third, we will develop marine science and technology and strive to promote the transformation of marine science and technology to innovation-led type. To build a maritime superpower, we must vigorously develop advanced marine technology. In recent years, Chinese marine science and technology have achieved some breakthroughs, and some research results have had a great impact on the international community. In general, however, marine science and technology is still a “weak link” (短腿, lit. short leg) and has difficulty meeting the development requirements of the marine industry. We must rely on scientific and technological progress and innovation and strive to break through the scientific and technological bottlenecks that impede the development of the marine economy and the protection of the marine ecosystem. "
Comrade Xi Jinping’s Remarks to the Eighth Collective Study Session of the CCP Politburo,Xi Jinping,"Jul 30, 2013","We must do a good job in overall planning for marine scientific and technological innovation, insist on doing what must be done and refraining from what must not be done, and focus on making breakthroughs in advanced marine technology in the deep-water, green, and safety fields. In particular, it is necessary to promote the research and development of core technologies and key general-purpose technologies that are urgently needed in the process of the transformation of the marine economy. It is necessary to carry out in-depth scientific investigations in open ocean and polar regions, carry out deep-sea and far–off-shore surveys and research, expand international cooperation in marine science and technology, and make preliminary preparations for the utilization of ocean and polar resources. "
Comrade Xi Jinping’s Remarks to the Eighth Collective Study Session of the CCP Politburo,Xi Jinping,"Jul 30, 2013","Fourth, we will safeguard national maritime rights and interests and strive to promote the transformation of maritime rights protection to a unified and comprehensive type. Due to complicated historical reasons, China’s surrounding waters, and especially the South China Sea, are among the regions in the world with the most disputes over island sovereignty, most acute maritime delimitation issues, most intense competition for resources, and most complicated geopolitical situation. More than half of the 3 million square kilometers of maritime jurisdiction claimed by China involve overlapping maritime claims and jurisdictional disputes with neighboring countries. Our work as regards safeguarding maritime rights and interests is facing a very complicated and serious situation. To solve this problem, we must implement unified coordination for the two overall interests of maintaining stability and safeguarding rights, insist on maintaining the unity of national sovereignty, security, and development interests, maintain maritime rights and interests in a manner corresponding to the increase in overall national strength, and achieve progress while maintaining stability. "
Comrade Xi Jinping’s Remarks to the Eighth Collective Study Session of the CCP Politburo,Xi Jinping,"Jul 30, 2013","On the one hand, we must persist in resolving disputes through peaceful methods and negotiation methods and strive to maintain peace and stability in the South China Sea and the East China Sea. On the other hand, we must be prepared to deal with various complex situations, strengthen the building of forces for the protection of maritime rights and law enforcement, accelerate the pace of construction of a modernized navy, improve maritime rights protection capabilities, and resolutely safeguard China’s maritime rights and interests. We love peace and adhere to the path of peaceful development, but we must never give up our legitimate rights and interests, let alone sacrifice our country’s core interests. "
Comrade Xi Jinping’s Remarks to the Eighth Collective Study Session of the CCP Politburo,Xi Jinping,"Jul 30, 2013","We must adhere to the principles of “sovereignty belongs to us (主权属我), shelving differences, and seeking joint development,” promote mutually beneficial and friendly cooperation with ASEAN countries, find and expand the convergence of common interests by strengthening cooperation, and create the conditions for the resolution of maritime issues. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen security dialogs, strengthen communication and coordination with relevant parties, and strive to resolve differences and eliminate misjudgments. "
Comrade Xi Jinping’s Remarks to the Eighth Collective Study Session of the CCP Politburo,Xi Jinping,"Jul 30, 2013","In short, building a maritime superpower is an important part of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics. We must further concern ourselves with the ocean, understand the ocean, and manage the ocean so as to promote the continuous realization of new achievements in China’s construction of a maritime superpower. "
Fighting COVID-19 and Leading Economic Recovery Through Solidarity and Cooperation – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the APEC Informal Economic Leaders’ Retreat,Xi Jinping,"Jul 16, 2021","The Right Honorable Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern,"
Fighting COVID-19 and Leading Economic Recovery Through Solidarity and Cooperation – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the APEC Informal Economic Leaders’ Retreat,Xi Jinping,"Jul 16, 2021","Dear Colleagues,"
Fighting COVID-19 and Leading Economic Recovery Through Solidarity and Cooperation – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the APEC Informal Economic Leaders’ Retreat,Xi Jinping,"Jul 16, 2021",It gives me great pleasure to attend this meeting. I thank Prime Minister Ardern and the New Zealand government for their great efforts to make the meeting possible.
Fighting COVID-19 and Leading Economic Recovery Through Solidarity and Cooperation – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the APEC Informal Economic Leaders’ Retreat,Xi Jinping,"Jul 16, 2021","As we speak, the COVID-19 pandemic is undergoing many twists and turns, including the constant mutations of the virus. Controlling the pandemic still poses a difficult challenge, while global economic recovery is still on shaky ground. That said, peace and development remains the theme of our times, and the call for upholding multilateralism, strengthening solidarity and cooperation, and meeting challenges together is growing stronger than ever."
Fighting COVID-19 and Leading Economic Recovery Through Solidarity and Cooperation – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the APEC Informal Economic Leaders’ Retreat,Xi Jinping,"Jul 16, 2021","The Asia-Pacific is a major engine for global economic growth. For member economies of the Asia-Pacific, defeating COVID-19 and restoring growth at an early date are our top priority for the time being. Since the start of the pandemic, APEC members have united as one and carried out active cooperation against the coronavirus. Being the first to gain the momentum for recovery, the Asia-Pacific economy has made contributions to driving the world economy. Last year, we adopted the APEC Putrajaya Vision 2040 and set ourselves the goal of an open, dynamic, resilient and peaceful Asia-Pacific community, charting the course for economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific. Under the current circumstances, we must enhance solidarity and cooperation to overcome the impact of the pandemic and boost global economic recovery."
Fighting COVID-19 and Leading Economic Recovery Through Solidarity and Cooperation – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the APEC Informal Economic Leaders’ Retreat,Xi Jinping,"Jul 16, 2021","First, we need to strengthen international cooperation on COVID response. The pandemic proves once again that we live in one global village, where countries stand to rise and fall together. We must stick to solidarity and cooperation as we go through this difficult time and jointly work for a healthier and brighter future for humanity. Vaccines are a powerful weapon to prevail over the pandemic and revive the economy. China has been calling for closer international cooperation on vaccines to ensure that they are accessible and affordable in developing countries and that they become a global public good. Overcoming the challenges of its own mass vaccination program, China has provided more than 500 million doses of vaccines to other developing countries, and will provide another 3 billion US dollars in international aid over the next three years to support COVID-19 response and economic and social recovery in other developing countries. China supports waiving intellectual property rights on COVID-19 vaccines, and will work with other parties to push for an early decision by the World Trade Organization (WTO) and other international institutions. China will take an active part in cooperation initiatives to keep vaccine supply chains stable and safe and support the movement of essential goods, and take effective measures to ensure healthy, safe and orderly people-to-people exchanges and restore normal business cooperation in our region at an early date. China has financed the founding of a Sub-Fund on APEC Cooperation on Combating COVID-19 and Economic Recovery, which will help APEC economies win an early victory over COVID-19 and achieve economic recovery."
Fighting COVID-19 and Leading Economic Recovery Through Solidarity and Cooperation – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the APEC Informal Economic Leaders’ Retreat,Xi Jinping,"Jul 16, 2021","Second, we need to deepen regional economic integration. Opening-up and integration is the prevailing trend. It is important that we promote the liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment and uphold the multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core. We must remove barriers, not erect walls. We must open up, not close off. We must seek integration, not decoupling. This is the way to make economic globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial for all. We need to step up macroeconomic policy coordination, minimize negative spillovers, and fully implement the APEC Connectivity Blueprint to promote cooperation on digital connectivity. We need to advance regional economic integration, with a view to establishing a high-standard Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific at an early date. China is among the first to ratify the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement. We look forward to its entry into force this year."
Fighting COVID-19 and Leading Economic Recovery Through Solidarity and Cooperation – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the APEC Informal Economic Leaders’ Retreat,Xi Jinping,"Jul 16, 2021","Third, we need to pursue inclusive and sustainable development. Earth is the only home for humanity. We must follow a people-centered approach, foster a sound environment to buttress sustainable economic and social development worldwide, and achieve green growth. China attaches great importance to addressing climate change. We will strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. China supports APEC in advancing cooperation on sustainable development, improving the List of Environmental Goods, and making energy more efficient, clean and diverse. We need to enhance economic and technological cooperation, promote inclusive trade and investment, support the development of small- and medium-sized enterprises, scale up support for women and other vulnerable groups, share experience on eliminating absolute poverty and strive to deliver the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development."
Fighting COVID-19 and Leading Economic Recovery Through Solidarity and Cooperation – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the APEC Informal Economic Leaders’ Retreat,Xi Jinping,"Jul 16, 2021","Fourth, we need to seize opportunities from scientific and technological innovation. The digital economy is an important area for the future growth of the world economy. The global digital economy is an open and close-knit entity. Win-win cooperation is the only right way forward, while a closed-door policy, exclusion, confrontation and division would only lead to a dead end. We need to ensure full and balanced implementation of the APEC Internet and Digital Economy Roadmap, further develop digital infrastructure, facilitate the dissemination and application of new technologies, and work for a digital business environment that is open, fair and non-discriminatory. China has concluded a number of cooperation initiatives, including those on using digital technologies for the prevention and control of COVID-19 and on smart cities. We will host a workshop on digital capacity building and take forward such initiatives as bolstering the recovery of the tourism sector with digital tools, as part of our efforts to contribute more to Asia-Pacific cooperation on digital economy."
Fighting COVID-19 and Leading Economic Recovery Through Solidarity and Cooperation – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the APEC Informal Economic Leaders’ Retreat,Xi Jinping,"Jul 16, 2021","Colleagues,"
Fighting COVID-19 and Leading Economic Recovery Through Solidarity and Cooperation – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the APEC Informal Economic Leaders’ Retreat,Xi Jinping,"Jul 16, 2021","China has embarked on a new journey toward fully building a modern socialist country. As China enters a new development stage, we will follow a new development philosophy and foster a new development paradigm. We will build a new system of open economy of higher standards, create a more attractive business environment, and advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. We hope to work with countries in the Asia-Pacific and beyond to achieve higher-standard mutual benefit and win-win cooperation."
Fighting COVID-19 and Leading Economic Recovery Through Solidarity and Cooperation – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the APEC Informal Economic Leaders’ Retreat,Xi Jinping,"Jul 16, 2021","There is a Maori saying in New Zealand that goes, “Turn your face to the sun and the shadows will fall behind you.” We have full confidence in humanity’s victory over the pandemic through cooperation. We have full confidence in the prospects of world economic recovery. We have full confidence in a shared, bright future of humanity. Let us stand with each other in solidarity, promote anti-COVID cooperation and economic recovery, and work for a bright future of prosperity for all in the Asia-Pacific."
Fighting COVID-19 and Leading Economic Recovery Through Solidarity and Cooperation – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the APEC Informal Economic Leaders’ Retreat,Xi Jinping,"Jul 16, 2021",Thank you.
Fighting COVID-19 in Solidarity and Advancing BRICS Cooperation Through Concerted Efforts – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 12th BRICS Summit,Xi Jinping,"Nov 17, 2020","Your Excellency President Vladimir Putin,"
Fighting COVID-19 in Solidarity and Advancing BRICS Cooperation Through Concerted Efforts – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 12th BRICS Summit,Xi Jinping,"Nov 17, 2020","Your Excellency Prime Minister Narendra Modi,"
Fighting COVID-19 in Solidarity and Advancing BRICS Cooperation Through Concerted Efforts – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 12th BRICS Summit,Xi Jinping,"Nov 17, 2020","Your Excellency President Cyril Ramaphosa,"
Fighting COVID-19 in Solidarity and Advancing BRICS Cooperation Through Concerted Efforts – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 12th BRICS Summit,Xi Jinping,"Nov 17, 2020","Your Excellency President Jair Bolsonaro,"
Fighting COVID-19 in Solidarity and Advancing BRICS Cooperation Through Concerted Efforts – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 12th BRICS Summit,Xi Jinping,"Nov 17, 2020","I wish to begin by thanking President Putin and the Russian government for their thoughtful organization of this BRICS Summit. Right now, the world is caught between a pandemic of the century and momentous changes never seen in the last one hundred years. The international landscape keeps evolving in profound ways. At such a critical moment, we are meeting to discuss our joint response to COVID-19 and draw a blueprint for the future of BRICS. The meeting has thus taken on a special significance."
Fighting COVID-19 in Solidarity and Advancing BRICS Cooperation Through Concerted Efforts – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 12th BRICS Summit,Xi Jinping,"Nov 17, 2020","Around the world, COVID-19 is posing a grave threat to people’s life and well-being. The global public health system is facing a severe test. Human society is going through the most serious pandemic in the past century. International trade and investment have shrunk considerably. The flow of goods and personnel has been impeded. Factors for uncertainty and instability are numerous. The world economy is witnessing the worst recession since the Great Depression in the 1930s. Unilateralism, protectionism and acts of bullying are becoming rampant, and the deficit in governance, trust, development and peace is widening instead of narrowing."
Fighting COVID-19 in Solidarity and Advancing BRICS Cooperation Through Concerted Efforts – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 12th BRICS Summit,Xi Jinping,"Nov 17, 2020","Despite all this, we remain convinced that the theme of our times, peace and development, has not changed, and that the trend toward multipolarity and economic globalization cannot be turned around. We must keep people’s welfare close to heart and pursue the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind. Through concrete actions, we will contribute our share to making the world a better place for everyone."
Fighting COVID-19 in Solidarity and Advancing BRICS Cooperation Through Concerted Efforts – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 12th BRICS Summit,Xi Jinping,"Nov 17, 2020","First, we need to uphold multilateralism, and safeguard peace and stability in our world. History teaches us that multilateralism, equity and justice can keep war and conflict at bay, while unilateralism and power politics will inflate dispute and confrontation. Flouting rules and laws, treading the path of unilateralism and bullying, and withdrawing from international organizations and agreements run counter to the will of the general public and trample on the legitimate rights and dignity of all nations."
Fighting COVID-19 in Solidarity and Advancing BRICS Cooperation Through Concerted Efforts – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 12th BRICS Summit,Xi Jinping,"Nov 17, 2020","Facing the choice between multilateralism and unilateralism, and between justice and hegemony, we BRICS countries must stand up for equity and justice in the world. We must hold high the banner of multilateralism, and defend the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations. We must endeavor to safeguard the UN-centered international system and the international order underpinned by international law. It is important that countries rise above ideology and respect each other’s choices of social system, economic model and development path consistent with their national conditions. We need to champion the concept of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security. We need to work through consultation and negotiation to address differences. We need to oppose interference in others’ internal affairs, as well as unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction. With concerted efforts, we will foster a peaceful and stable environment for development."
Fighting COVID-19 in Solidarity and Advancing BRICS Cooperation Through Concerted Efforts – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 12th BRICS Summit,Xi Jinping,"Nov 17, 2020","Second, we need to enhance solidarity and coordination, and come together to meet the COVID-19 challenge. The coronavirus is still causing havoc in many places and waves of infection are resurging. Securing a worldwide victory against the pandemic remains an uphill journey. Nearly one year into the battle, many countries have gained important experience on COVID-19 containment and made encouraging progress in drugs and vaccine research and development (R&D). Our fight over the past year proves that as long as we stand in unity and follow science, we can control the spread of the virus and offset its impact."
Fighting COVID-19 in Solidarity and Advancing BRICS Cooperation Through Concerted Efforts – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 12th BRICS Summit,Xi Jinping,"Nov 17, 2020","What is important is that we put people’s life and health first, mobilize all resources and do everything we can to protect people’s safety and well-being. It is important to step up international coordination and response, and share information and epidemic control experience to stop the virus in its tracks. It is important that we support WHO’s crucial leadership role in this endeavor. As we speak, Chinese companies are working with their Russian and Brazilian partners on phase-III clinical trials of vaccines, and we are prepared to have cooperation with South Africa and India as well. China has joined the COVAX facility, a platform on which we will share vaccines with other countries, developing countries in particular. We will actively consider providing vaccines to BRICS countries where there is a need. To support the development of the BRICS Vaccine R&D Center, China has designated its own national center. We will work with other BRICS countries both online and offline to advance collective vaccine research and trials, set up plants, authorize production and recognize each other’s standards. I propose that we convene a BRICS symposium on traditional medicine to explore its role in coronavirus prevention and treatment. This may well boost the global arsenal against COVID-19."
Fighting COVID-19 in Solidarity and Advancing BRICS Cooperation Through Concerted Efforts – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 12th BRICS Summit,Xi Jinping,"Nov 17, 2020","What has happened shows that acts of politicization, stigmatization, blame-shifting and scapegoating only serve to disrupt overall global cooperation against the virus. We need to overcome division with unity, replace bias with reason and stamp out the “political virus”. In this way, we will pool the maximum global synergy to beat the virus."
Fighting COVID-19 in Solidarity and Advancing BRICS Cooperation Through Concerted Efforts – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 12th BRICS Summit,Xi Jinping,"Nov 17, 2020","Third, we need to pursue openness and innovation, and promote global economic recovery. The IMF predicts that the world economy will shrink by 4.4 percent this year, and that emerging markets and developing countries will experience negative growth for the first time in 60 years. To stabilize the economy while controlling the pandemic is the pressing task facing all countries. Under the precondition that safety is ensured, we must actively pursue economic recovery and seek to carry out economic and social activities in an orderly way as we fight the virus on an ongoing basis. We need to strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination, follow through on the initiative on facilitating cross-border flow of people and goods, and keep industrial and supply chains safe and open to better enable the resumption of business activities and economic recovery."
Fighting COVID-19 in Solidarity and Advancing BRICS Cooperation Through Concerted Efforts – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 12th BRICS Summit,Xi Jinping,"Nov 17, 2020","The practice of using the pandemic to pursue “de-globalization” or clamor for “economic decoupling” and “parallel systems” will end up hurting one’s own interests and the common interests of all. Under the current situation, we need to stand firm for building an open world economy. We need to uphold the multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core and reject abuse of the “national security” concept for protectionist purposes. We need to leverage the new business forms and models triggered by the pandemic, strengthen cooperation on scientific and technological innovation, and nurture an open, fair, equitable and nondiscriminatory business environment to bring about common development of higher quality and stronger resilience."

All our efforts, from clearing the impact of COVID-19 and getting back to a normal life, to ending conflicts and humanitarian crises, ultimately depend on people-centered development. According to World Bank forecast, global per capita income might drop 3.6 percent this year, and some 88 million to 115 million people might be pushed into extreme poverty due to the pandemic."

We need to call on the international community to place the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development at the heart of international development cooperation. Poverty eradication must be made a primary goal, and more resources must be channeled to poverty reduction, education, health and infrastructure development. We need to support the UN’s coordinating role and foster global development partnerships that are more equal and balanced, so that the fruits of development will spread to more developing countries and the needs of underprivileged groups will be better addressed."

To tackle climate change, we must never relax our efforts. We need to implement the Paris Agreement in good faith, stick to the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, and provide more help to developing countries, particularly the small island developing states. China is prepared to take on international responsibilities befitting its level of development, and will continue to make extraordinary efforts to address climate change. Recently, I announced at the UN China’s initiative to scale up its nationally determined contributions and adopt more forceful policies and measures to strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. You can count on China to keep its promise."

Based on a scientific analysis of the new stage of China’s development, we will stay committed to the new development philosophy, and actively foster a new development paradigm with domestic circulation as the mainstay and domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other. We will redouble efforts to expand domestic demand, deepen reform across the board and promote innovation in science and technology to add impetus to China’s economic growth. China will not shut its door of opening-up; it will embrace the world with more open arms. China will be more vigorous in integrating with the global market and will take greater initiative in deepening international cooperation. In so doing, China will create more opportunities and space for global recovery and growth."

I wish to thank President Biden for the kind invitation. It is good to have this opportunity to have an in-depth exchange of views with you on climate change, and to discuss ways to tackle this challenge and find a path forward for man and nature to live in harmony."
For Man and Nature: Building a Community of Life Together – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Leaders Summit on Climate,Xi Jinping,"Apr 22, 2021","Since time of the industrial civilization, mankind has created massive material wealth. Yet, it has come at a cost of intensified exploitation of natural resources, which disrupted the balance in the Earth’s ecosystem, and laid bare the growing tensions in the human-nature relationship. In recent years, climate change, biodiversity loss, worsening desertification and frequent extreme weather events have all posed severe challenges to human survival and development. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has added difficulty to economic and social development across countries. Faced with unprecedented challenges in global environmental governance, the international community needs to come up with unprecedented ambition and action. We need to act with a sense of responsibility and unity, and work together to foster a community of life for man and nature."
For Man and Nature: Building a Community of Life Together – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Leaders Summit on Climate,Xi Jinping,"Apr 22, 2021","— We must be committed to harmony between man and nature. “All things that grow live in harmony and benefit from the nourishment of nature.” Mother nature is the cradle of all living beings, including humans. It provides everything essential for humanity to survive and thrive. Mother nature has nourished us, and we must treat nature as our root, respect it, protect it, and follow its laws. Failure to respect nature or follow its laws will only invite its revenge. Systemic spoil of nature will take away the foundation of human survival and development, and will leave us human beings like a river without a source and a tree without its roots. We should protect nature and preserve the environment like we protect our eyes, and endeavor to foster a new relationship where man and nature can both prosper and live in harmony."
For Man and Nature: Building a Community of Life Together – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Leaders Summit on Climate,Xi Jinping,"Apr 22, 2021","— We must be committed to green development. Green mountains are gold mountains. To protect the environment is to protect productivity, and to improve the environment is to boost productivity — the truth is as simple as that. We must abandon development models that harm or undermine the environment, and must say no to shortsighted approaches of going after near-term development gains at the expense of the environment. Much to the contrary, we need to ride the trend of technological revolution and industrial transformation, seize the enormous opportunity in green transition, and let the power of innovation drive us to upgrade our economic, energy and industrial structures, and make sure that a sound environment is there to buttress sustainable economic and social development worldwide."
For Man and Nature: Building a Community of Life Together – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Leaders Summit on Climate,Xi Jinping,"Apr 22, 2021","— We must be committed to systemic governance. Mountains, rivers, forests as well as farmlands, lakes, grasslands and deserts all make indivisible parts of the ecosystem. Protecting the ecosystem requires more than a simplistic, palliative approach. We need to follow the innate laws of the ecosystem and properly balance all elements and aspects of nature. This is a way that may take us where we want to be, an ecosystem in sound circulation and overall balance."
For Man and Nature: Building a Community of Life Together – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Leaders Summit on Climate,Xi Jinping,"Apr 22, 2021","— We must be committed to a people-centered approach. The environment concerns the well-being of people in all countries. We need to take into full account people’s longing for a better life and a good environment as well as our responsibility for future generations. We need to look for ways to protect the environment, grow the economy, create jobs and remove poverty all at the same time, so as to deliver social equity and justice in the course of green transition and increase people’s sense of benefit, happiness and security."
For Man and Nature: Building a Community of Life Together – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Leaders Summit on Climate,Xi Jinping,"Apr 22, 2021","— We must be committed to multilateralism. We need to work on the basis of international law, follow the principle of equity and justice, and focus on effective actions. We need to uphold the UN-centered international system, comply with the objectives and principles laid out in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its Paris Agreement, and strive to deliver the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We need to each take stronger actions, strengthen partnerships and cooperation, learn from each other and make common progress in the new journey toward global carbon neutrality. In this process, we must join hands, not point fingers at each other; we must maintain continuity, not reverse course easily; and we must honor commitments, not go back on promises."

Developing countries now face multiple challenges to combat COVID-19, grow the economy, and address climate change. We need to give full recognition to developing countries’ contribution to climate action and accommodate their particular difficulties and concerns. Developed countries need to increase climate ambition and action. At the same time, they need to make concrete efforts to help developing countries strengthen the capacity and resilience against climate change, support them in financing, technology, and capacity building, and refrain from creating green trade barriers, so as to help developing countries accelerate the transition to green and low-carbon development."

It has been our constant pursuit that man and nature could live in harmony with each other. Ecological advancement and conservation have been written into China’s Constitution and incorporated into China’s overall plan for building socialism with Chinese characteristics. China will follow the Thought on Ecological Civilization and implement the new development philosophy. We will aim to achieve greener economic and social development in all aspects, with a special focus on developing green and low-carbon energy. We will continue to prioritize ecological conservation and pursue a green and low-carbon path to development."
For Man and Nature: Building a Community of Life Together – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Leaders Summit on Climate,Xi Jinping,"Apr 22, 2021","Last year, I made the official announcement that China will strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. This major strategic decision is made based on our sense of responsibility to build a community with a shared future for mankind and our own need to secure sustainable development. China has committed to move from carbon peak to carbon neutrality in a much shorter time span than what might take many developed countries, and that requires extraordinarily hard efforts from China. The targets of carbon peak and carbon neutrality have been added to China’s overall plan for ecological conservation. We are now making an action plan and are already taking strong nationwide actions toward carbon peak. Support is being given to peaking pioneers from localities, sectors and companies. China will strictly control coal-fired power generation projects, and strictly limit the increase in coal consumption over the 14th Five-Year Plan period and phase it down in the 15th Five-Year Plan period. Moreover, China has decided to accept the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol and tighten regulations over non-carbon dioxide emissions. China’s national carbon market will also start trading."
For Man and Nature: Building a Community of Life Together – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Leaders Summit on Climate,Xi Jinping,"Apr 22, 2021","As a participant, contributor and trailblazer in global ecological conservation, China is firmly committed to putting multilateralism into action and promoting a fair and equitable system of global environmental governance for win-win cooperation. China will host COP15 to the Convention on Biological Diversity this October and looks forward to working with all parties to enhance global governance on biodiversity. We support COP26 to the UNFCCC in achieving positive outcomes. As we in China often say, “It is more important to show people how to fish than just giving them fish.” China has done its best to help developing countries build capacity against climate change through various forms of results-oriented South-South cooperation. From remote sensing satellites for climate monitoring in Africa to low-carbon demonstration zones in Southeast Asia and to energy-efficient lights in small island countries, such cooperation has yielded real, tangible and solid results. China has also made ecological cooperation a key part of Belt and Road cooperation. A number of green action initiatives have been launched, covering wide-ranging efforts in green infrastructure, green energy, green transport and green finance, to bring enduring benefits to the people of all Belt and Road partner countries."

Fostering a New Development Paradigm and Pursuing Mutual Benefit and Win-win Cooperation – Keynote Address by Xi Jinping at the APEC CEO Dialogues,Xi Jinping,"Nov 19, 2020","This is an unusual time in history for us humanity. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated changes unseen in a century in the world. The global economy finds itself into deep recession, its industrial and supply chains are disrupted, and governance, trust, development and peace deficits continue to grow. Mounting unilateralism, protectionism and bullying as well as backlash against economic globalization have added to risks and uncertainties in the world economy."
Fostering a New Development Paradigm and Pursuing Mutual Benefit and Win-win Cooperation – Keynote Address by Xi Jinping at the APEC CEO Dialogues,Xi Jinping,"Nov 19, 2020","However, peace and development remain the underlying trend of our times. Meeting challenges through cooperation is the only way forward for us in the international community. This pandemic once again shows that the interests of all countries are closely interwoven and that humankind shares a common stake. Indeed, our world is an indivisible community with a shared future. To beat the virus and promote global recovery, we in the international community must close ranks and jointly respond to this crisis and meet the test. All countries should act in the spirit of partnership and get through this tough time together. We need to step up policy communication and coordination, intensify all-round global cooperation against COVID-19 and keep global economy open. By doing so, we can defeat the virus at an early date and achieve robust, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth for all."
Fostering a New Development Paradigm and Pursuing Mutual Benefit and Win-win Cooperation – Keynote Address by Xi Jinping at the APEC CEO Dialogues,Xi Jinping,"Nov 19, 2020","Since the start of this year, facing the sudden onslaught of COVID-19, China has put people and life above everything else. The 1.4 billion Chinese people, united as one, have made a major strategic achievement in fighting the virus. We have endeavored to both contain the virus and speedily bring production and life back to normal, thus maintaining economic and social development. China’s economy resumed positive overall growth in the first three quarters this year. This hard-won achievement speaks volumes about the resilience and vitality of the Chinese economy. The fundamentals sustaining China’s steady and long-term economic growth remain unchanged. We have full confidence and ability to maintain stable economic performance and achieve the goals of finishing the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects and eradicating poverty within the set time frame."
Fostering a New Development Paradigm and Pursuing Mutual Benefit and Win-win Cooperation – Keynote Address by Xi Jinping at the APEC CEO Dialogues,Xi Jinping,"Nov 19, 2020","At its recently concluded Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee, the Communist Party of China deliberated on and adopted the recommendations for formulating China’s 14th Five-Year Plan. According to the recommendations, China will complete building a moderately prosperous society in all respects within the set time frame. From next year on, China will embark on a new journey toward fully building a modern socialist country. We will develop a full understanding of the new development stage, and apply the new development philosophy. We will foster a new development paradigm with domestic circulation as the mainstay and domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other. The new development paradigm is a strategic decision we have made based on the current stage and conditions of development in China and with full consideration given to economic globalization and changes in the external environment."
Fostering a New Development Paradigm and Pursuing Mutual Benefit and Win-win Cooperation – Keynote Address by Xi Jinping at the APEC CEO Dialogues,Xi Jinping,"Nov 19, 2020","First, we will expand domestic demand as a strategic priority and ensure smooth flow of economic activity. In recent years, China’s development model of reliance on foreign markets and resources has gone through some gradual changes. The ratio of foreign trade to GDP dropped from 67 percent in 2006 to less than 32 percent in 2019, while the ratio of current account surplus to GDP has come down from 9.9 percent in 2007 to less than one percent today. In seven years since the 2008 global financial crisis, the contribution of China’s domestic demand to GDP exceeded 100 percent, making domestic consumption the main driver of its growth. In promoting domestic and international circulations, the Chinese economy has become much more domestically driven and the performance of China’s development has been significantly enhanced. Fostering a new development paradigm will enable China to better adjust its economic structure and achieve high-quality development. China will continue to deepen supply-side structural reforms and further expand domestic demand. Doing so will make production, distribution, flow of goods and services, and consumption in China more based on domestic market, and it will make the supply system better adapt to domestic demand. This will usher in a higher stage of well-adjusted balance where demand drives supply and supply, in turn, creates demand."
Fostering a New Development Paradigm and Pursuing Mutual Benefit and Win-win Cooperation – Keynote Address by Xi Jinping at the APEC CEO Dialogues,Xi Jinping,"Nov 19, 2020","Second, we will vigorously make scientific and technological innovations to foster new growth drivers. A new round of technological revolution and industrial transformation is gathering pace, and science and technology are playing an even more significant role in boosting social productivity. To China, innovation has always been the primary driver of development, and we have made major achievements by implementing an innovation-driven development strategy. As China enters a new stage of development, factors of production underpinning its development have gone through profound changes. This means that China must pursue innovation to achieve high-quality growth driven by domestic demand. We will fully leverage the demand of our super-sized domestic market and the strengths of its complete industrial system and redouble efforts to turn research outcomes into real productivity. We will endeavor to build an innovation system that integrates science and technology, education, industries and the financial sector, and upgrade the industrial chains. This will sustain China’s long-term economic development."
Fostering a New Development Paradigm and Pursuing Mutual Benefit and Win-win Cooperation – Keynote Address by Xi Jinping at the APEC CEO Dialogues,Xi Jinping,"Nov 19, 2020","Third, we will continue to deepen reform and energize the market. What we have achieved during the past 40-plus years of China’s reform and opening-up shows one thing: Reform is crucial for unleashing and boosting productivity. China has entered a new stage of development and faces new tasks of reform. We will take more steps and remove with greater resolve deep-seated systemic and institutional barriers to modernize China’s governance system and capacity. We will enhance our ability to better apply the new development philosophy, namely, one of pursuing innovative, coordinated, green, open and shared development. We will transform the growth model, upgrade quality and performance, and make growth drivers more robust. We will accelerate the building of a modernized economy, strengthen protection of property and intellectual property rights, set up a high-standard market system and improve mechanisms for fair competition. All this will fully motivate all types of market entities."

Fostering a New Development Paradigm and Pursuing Mutual Benefit and Win-win Cooperation – Keynote Address by Xi Jinping at the APEC CEO Dialogues,Xi Jinping,"Nov 19, 2020","Openness enables a country to move forward, while seclusion holds it back. In today’s world where economic globalization has become an irreversible trend, no country can develop itself by keeping its doors closed. China is already deeply integrated into the global economy and the international system. We will not reverse course or run against historical trend by “decoupling” or forming a small circle to keep others out. By fostering a new development paradigm, we are not pursuing a closed-door circulation, but open and mutually reinforcing domestic and international circulations."
Fostering a New Development Paradigm and Pursuing Mutual Benefit and Win-win Cooperation – Keynote Address by Xi Jinping at the APEC CEO Dialogues,Xi Jinping,"Nov 19, 2020","— The new development paradigm will enable China to fully unlock its market potential and create greater demand for other countries. China’s per capita GDP has topped US$10,000, and its middle-income population has exceeded 400 million. It is projected by many international institutions that China’s retail market will reach six trillion dollars in size this year. As China’s economy grows, our people naturally want to lead an even better life. This will create more demand for a greater variety of quality products, technologies and services from across the world. Despite the damage inflicted by COVID-19, China’s import of goods has basically recovered to the level of last year. The China International Fair for Trade in Services held in Beijing this September brought together 22,000 companies from 148 countries and regions to its online and off line events. Not long ago, the third China International Import Expo was successfully held in Shanghai. It was participated by companies from 124 countries and regions. The exhibition area was further expanded. More deals were sealed, reaching US$72.62 billion in value. China will further cut tariffs and government instituted transaction costs, and open a number of demonstration zones for creative promotion of import trade to increase import of quality goods and services. I am confident that the steady unleashing of the China market potential will create vast business possibilities for other countries, and this will create stronger impetus for maintaining stable growth of the global economy."
Fostering a New Development Paradigm and Pursuing Mutual Benefit and Win-win Cooperation – Keynote Address by Xi Jinping at the APEC CEO Dialogues,Xi Jinping,"Nov 19, 2020","— The new development paradigm will enable China to open up wider and share more opportunities for common development with other countries. China is committed to opening-up, which is its fundamental policy, a policy that will not change at any time. The world economy has faced more instability and uncertainty this year. Protectionism and unilateralism are mounting. Yet China has not stalled in its pursuit of opening-up. As a matter of fact, we have taken many policy steps to open the country still wider. It includes the following: The Foreign Investment Law and its supporting rules and regulations have been fully implemented. The negative list for foreign investment has been further cut. Access to the financial market has been steadily eased. A master plan has been drawn up for the development of the Hainan Free Trade Port. Reform and opening-up in Shenzhen and Pudong have been further advanced. And more pilot programs have been conducted for creative promotion of trade in services. I wish to reiterate that China’s commitment to opening-up is strong, and that China will open its door still wider to the world. China will continue to advance trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, to conclude, through negotiation, high-standard free trade agreements with more countries, and to actively engage in bilateral, multilateral and regional mechanisms for trade and investment cooperation. The purpose is to build a higher-standard open economy in China. China will improve its system for foreign investment management based on pre-establishment national treatment and negative list. The lawful rights and interests of foreign investors will be protected. China will open up the service sector in a well-planned way, and foster a market-oriented, world-class business environment underpinned by a sound legal framework. China will give its pilot free trade zones greater power in carrying out reform, and turn them into new pacesetters of opening-up. At the same time, China will continue to firmly support the multilateral trading system, get more actively involved in reforming the system of global economic governance, and play its part to make this system fairer and more equitable."
Fostering a New Development Paradigm and Pursuing Mutual Benefit and Win-win Cooperation – Keynote Address by Xi Jinping at the APEC CEO Dialogues,Xi Jinping,"Nov 19, 2020","— The new development paradigm will enable China to continue to deepen international cooperation for shared benefits. China will take a more active part in the international division of labor, get more effectively integrated into global industrial, supply and value chains, and more enthusiastically expand exchanges and cooperation with other countries. We welcome cooperation with every other region, country, or company that wants to do so. China will remain committed to openness and cooperation, and adhere to multilateralism and the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits. China will work to pursue high-quality Belt and Road cooperation with its partners, and seek greater complementarity between the development strategies and connectivity plans of regions and countries concerned. China will further harmonize policies, rules and standards with BRI partners, and deepen effective cooperation with them on infrastructure, industry, trade, scientific and technological innovation, public health and people-to-people exchange. Together, we will make the Belt and Road a model of cooperation, health, recovery and growth and deepen cooperation on green development.

"Grasping the Basis of Journalism ——Xi Jinping, Secretary of Fujian Ningde Prefectural Party Committee, Talks about Journalism",Xi Jinping,"Jul 30, 1989","With calm analysis and thinking, recognize the current situation"
"Grasping the Basis of Journalism ——Xi Jinping, Secretary of Fujian Ningde Prefectural Party Committee, Talks about Journalism",Xi Jinping,"Jul 30, 1989","Xi Jinping believes that at present, it is necessary to further strengthen the understanding of the status and role of journalism and to further strengthen the Party’s leadership over journalism. Raising awareness and strengthening leadership must be carried out in light of the current situation. Journalism must grasp the pulse of the times and recognize the tasks and responsibilities entrusted to us by the current situation. The achievements of the ten-year reform are enormous, but it also faces many difficulties and problems. On the one hand, journalism cannot be conservative, ignoring reform with deaf ears to every voice. On the other hand, you cannot copy what others say. At present, there are various social trends of thought. We should think calmly through our own minds and not be dominated by the ephemeral. It takes time to calmly analyze and judge affairs, and rushing to make judgments often leads to a one-sided or even wrong conclusion. Judging from some of the problems currently reflected, it does seem necessary to speed up the process of democracy and the construction of the legal system. As for how to accelerate and to what extent, there are certain scientific implications. Otherwise, democracy will be absolutized, premature, and separated from the current stage. In that case, what was originally very reasonable may become a very wrong thing."
"Grasping the Basis of Journalism ——Xi Jinping, Secretary of Fujian Ningde Prefectural Party Committee, Talks about Journalism",Xi Jinping,"Jul 30, 1989","What is democracy? Democracy cannot be defined in general terms. Democracy in a socialist country, I personally understand, should be a legal embodiment of the interests of the people. It is not the will of a certain class or certain people or any of the demands of any one class. Demanding extremes from others or the country is in itself a demand of others to be democratic to oneself while one does not have any sense of accountability or responsibility. This is unacceptable."
"Grasping the Basis of Journalism ——Xi Jinping, Secretary of Fujian Ningde Prefectural Party Committee, Talks about Journalism",Xi Jinping,"Jul 30, 1989","Just imagine, if people can do whatever they want, deciding not to engage in family planning and foregoing the task of requisitioning, would this work? Therefore, democracy itself cannot be absolute. It must have certain constraints. At the same time, democratic requirements are also phased and cannot be premature. We now have a phased approach to the cultivation of democratic qualities and the training of democracy. This is the current state of democracy. Can it be used maturely? Let us discuss the election of village committees. Discuss this use of democracy. Some places have done well, knowing how to plan well for the family with the ability to serve the fundamental interests of the village people. In some places, good clan elders are chosen. This has resulted in a paralyzed and semi-paralyzed state in rural grassroots organizations. Therefore, when we ask any question, we should not abandon its premise, background, or certain conditions. Otherwise, it will be difficult to even discuss such things. Is the Cultural Revolution not a specimen of the Great Democracy? This kind of “great democracy” is not instilled with science or the legal system, but rather with superstition and ignorance, and the result was a great turmoil. Anyone can organize a few people to raid their homes, and anyone can band together a fighting team. Today, you defeat me, and tomorrow, I defeat you. Can such hard times be repeated? Without stability and unity, nothing would be possible. The problem of democracy can only be solved on the track of the legal system."
"Grasping the Basis of Journalism ——Xi Jinping, Secretary of Fujian Ningde Prefectural Party Committee, Talks about Journalism",Xi Jinping,"Jul 30, 1989","There is also the issue of corruption, which is the most likely to stir righteous indignation. It should be said that every honest journalist and every person with a conscience speaks volumes about corruption and righteous indignation. This issue, however, has to be dealt with calmly. Now, we must not merely rage against corruption. Rather, we must reach a practical solution to corruption. Some criticize corruption, while simultaneously enjoying certain privileges. It can be seen that, from delivery to cremation, transactions may occur at every stage of life, and there may be unhealthy trends. What power can we give to our stethoscope for corruption? However, even it can also generate transactions, as can the steering wheel. This problem deserves our deep thought, and it is worth our in-depth analysis to explore the reasons and reach an effective solution. Otherwise, the problem becomes oversimplified."
"Grasping the Basis of Journalism ——Xi Jinping, Secretary of Fujian Ningde Prefectural Party Committee, Talks about Journalism",Xi Jinping,"Jul 30, 1989","To grasp the pulse of the times and understand the role of news, we must realize that news is the mouthpiece of the Party and the people, and it is responsible for the important task of reflecting and guiding public opinion. Our Party has always had a tradition of using newspapers, radio, television, and other propaganda tools to publicize the Party’s line, principles, and policies, to educate the people, to reflect the people’s voice, to promote righteousness, to expose negative and corrupt phenomena, and to mobilize and organize the masses to participate in the socialist construction cause. The Party spirit we emphasize contains the profound connotation of the people’s very nature. Journalists must not only publicize the Party’s propositions but also fully reflect the people’s wishes and demands, so as to unify the two. As a science, journalism is closely related to politics. However, it does not mean that news can be equated with politics, and it does not mean that its authenticity can be ignored for political needs. Therefore, it is necessary to emphasize the Party nature of news work, but not to ignore the regularity of news work itself."
"Grasping the Basis of Journalism ——Xi Jinping, Secretary of Fujian Ningde Prefectural Party Committee, Talks about Journalism",Xi Jinping,"Jul 30, 1989","At present, China’s reform is in a critical period. The mentality of the people is diverse, and there is constant friction among the various interests. As for how to solve these problems, a very important point is to give full play to the role of the news media in propagating reform and propagating the Party’s policies. Reform is a great social practice, and the news media must timely and accurately convey the Party and government’s principles, policies, and various information in the process of implementation, prompting Party organizations and governments at all levels to correct deviations in a timely manner such that the reform will be more direct and spur healthier growth. As for some vague awarenesses that exist in the masses, news media should be guided to alleviate conflicts in communication between the Party, the government, and the people and in ideological understandings between people in different regions. We must improve people’s understanding and support for reform and guide people’s thoughts and actions to “One Center, Two Basic Points” so as to guide to the great historical mission of “realizing the four modernizations and revitalizing China.” It should be affirmed that journalism has written a glorious page in the ten-year reform, made great contributions to the reform and opening up, and made great efforts as an important part of the Party’s development of political advantages. Being good at using news tools to promote work is actually a manifestation of leadership and modern working methods. The connection between leaders and the people comes in nothing more than two forms: One is mystical, and the other is open. Mystification is often associated with feudalism, closure, and economic backwardness; openness is often associated with a high degree of civilizational progress. Party organizations at all levels in our region should attach great importance to news work and effectively strengthen their leadership over news work."
"Grasping the Basis of Journalism ——Xi Jinping, Secretary of Fujian Ningde Prefectural Party Committee, Talks about Journalism",Xi Jinping,"Jul 30, 1989","In the near future, we should be good at using relatively modern media means to vigorously develop local newspapers, radio, and television stations. We must further improve the system of press conferences. In the spirit of doing more practical things for news work and doing what we can, we should gradually help news organizations solve problems such as funding, staffing, vehicles, office locations, housing, equipment, and treatment."
"Grasping the Basis of Journalism ——Xi Jinping, Secretary of Fujian Ningde Prefectural Party Committee, Talks about Journalism",Xi Jinping,"Jul 30, 1989",Do a good job in the guidance of public opinion and carry forward the righteousness of the society
"Grasping the Basis of Journalism ——Xi Jinping, Secretary of Fujian Ningde Prefectural Party Committee, Talks about Journalism",Xi Jinping,"Jul 30, 1989","Public opinion guidance and public opinion supervision are the two major functions of socialist journalism. The guidance of public opinion is to promote social integrity through news reports. As for the “promoting righteousness” that I speak of, this refers to strengthening people’s confidence in reform through the guidance of public opinion, recognizing the bright future of reform, and adhering to the four basic principles. At present, it is especially necessary to encourage everyone to actively participate in the work of governance, rectification, and reform in accordance with the spiritual requirements of the Central Committee, to maintain the authority of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and to maintain a stable and united political situation. How can the guidance of public opinion play the role of “promoting righteousness?” This requires every journalist to stick to positive propaganda and grasp the tone of news propaganda. In the previous period, there was such a saying: “Unspoken achievements carry no weight.” This statement is obviously one-sided. China’s ten-year reform has made great achievements, which is the mainstream of our work and is recognized by the world. News and propaganda must be truth-seeking, must publicize achievements confidently, and must enhance the cohesion of the Party and the authority of the government. Journalists should pay attention to these issues, grasp the essence of things, reflect the mainstream take of the issues, and play a role in promoting righteousness. Regarding the hot and difficult issues that the masses are concerned about, we should, on the premise of publicizing the achievements of the ten-year reform, clarify the nature of these issues to the masses and guide the masses to correctly understand that these issues arise when the democratic and legal system is not perfect during the transition between the old and the new systems. Such issues will be reduced and eliminated with the gradual deepening of China’s reform, the construction of a socialist spiritual civilization, and the continuous strengthening of democracy and legal system construction."
"Grasping the Basis of Journalism ——Xi Jinping, Secretary of Fujian Ningde Prefectural Party Committee, Talks about Journalism",Xi Jinping,"Jul 30, 1989","While strengthening the work of public opinion guidance, we must also pay attention to the role of public opinion supervision. Public opinion supervision is a key aspect of the strengthening of Party building and democratic political construction. Unchecked and unsupervised power is bound to lead to corruption. Whether corruption can be effectively stopped is related to the life and death of the Party and the success or failure of the socialist cause. This requires the establishment of various effective supervision mechanisms; public opinion supervision of the news media is the most frequent, open, and extensive method of supervision. At present, when emphasizing the strengthening of Party building and opposing corruption, we must give full play to the public opinion supervision function of news so that corruption can be exposed in broad daylight. Party organizations and governments at all levels should welcome journalists that report both good and bad news, take up the weapon of public opinion supervision, and expose and criticize problems in their own work and various corruption phenomena. Party and government leaders at all levels must correctly deal with news supervision, establish an open and enlightened attitude, not demand perfection from reporters, make friends with journalists, regard news supervision as support for local work, and create a good political environment for news supervision."
"Grasping the Basis of Journalism ——Xi Jinping, Secretary of Fujian Ningde Prefectural Party Committee, Talks about Journalism",Xi Jinping,"Jul 30, 1989","Using the weapon of public opinion supervision requires a strong sense of social responsibility and attention to social effects: It is conducive to maintaining a stable and united political situation, reform and opening up, and the Party’s work. The starting point of public opinion supervision should be positive and constructive, and the focus of supervision should be those that seriously violate the major policies of the Party and the state and major problems in social life, with a focus on common incidents. The facts revealed must be accurate. When it comes to criticism of first-level Party organizations and governments, we must be cautious and not jump to conclusions. It is necessary to conduct in-depth investigations, listen to opinions from multiple parties, and draw conclusions that are in line with the facts. In particular, we must pay attention not to criticize those problems that the masses have opinions on and which are temporarily difficult to solve due to limited conditions in our work. Let the people know that the Party and the government are taking measures to overcome difficulties to solve these problems."

It is the Party’s fine tradition to be deeply practical, to investigate, and to conduct research, and it is also the work style that journalists must have. Whether a report is well written or not has a lot to do with whether journalists can go deep into reality and conduct in-depth interviews. Judging from the situation in our region, at present, some journalists do not conduct enough research. They sit in the office to think of ideas and rely on briefings and conference materials to compile manuscripts. There are not many relevant reports in the newspapers that have in-depth content or a high level of quality; in particular, there are many good topics that go unreported, which has a lot to do with the lack of an in-depth understanding of reality. Investigation and research are the basic skills of journalists and the fundamental way for journalists to become talents. Only by persevering in investigation and research can we train ourselves to be journalists with correct thinking and a solid work style."

In the process of advancing supply-side structural reforms, some difficulties and challenges will inevitably be encountered.

We must also increase our awareness of danger, take precautions, conduct precise research and make accurate judgments, and properly respond to major risks that may arise in the economic field. All regions and departments must balance the relationship between stable growth and risk prevention and properly grasp the rhythm and intensity. We must steadily implement long-term mechanisms and solutions for the stable and healthy development of the real estate market. We must strengthen psychological analysis of the market, do a good job in evaluating the impact of policies on the financial market, and be adept at guiding expectations. We must strengthen market monitoring, strengthen supervision and coordination, and promptly eliminate hidden dangers. We must effectively solve the problem of financing difficulties for small, medium, and micro enterprises, strengthen assistance to enterprises to stabilize employment, and promptly implement policies that prioritize employment.

This is a major judgment based on the actual situation. The whole party must strengthen the “Four Consciousnesses”, uphold the “Four Matters of Confidence”, and practice the “Two Upholds.” We must consciously maintain a high degree of consistency with the Party Central Committee in ideological and political actions, consciously safeguard the solidarity and unity of the Party, strictly abide by the Party’s political discipline and political rules, and always maintain ties of flesh and blood to the people. The Chinese nation is at a critical juncture in its great rejuvenation, and our reform and development are at an important stage where difficulties must be overcome and barriers broken down.

Keeping up the Momentum and Working Together for A New Chapter in China-CEEC Cooperation – Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the China-CEEC Summit,Xi Jinping,"Feb 9, 2021","Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends,"
Keeping up the Momentum and Working Together for A New Chapter in China-CEEC Cooperation – Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the China-CEEC Summit,Xi Jinping,"Feb 9, 2021",Welcome to the China-CEEC Summit. This Summit takes place as countries are going all out to fight COVID-19. To meet at such an unusual moment shows our resolve to stand together in face of difficulties and pursue shared development through cooperation.
Keeping up the Momentum and Working Together for A New Chapter in China-CEEC Cooperation – Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the China-CEEC Summit,Xi Jinping,"Feb 9, 2021","It has been nine years since cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European countries (CEEC) started. Nine years ago, with a commitment to win-win cooperation and common development and a resolve to create a better future together, we jointly initiated this cooperation mechanism between China and CEE countries, a decision that responded to the call of our times and the trend of development. China-CEEC relations have thus entered a new stage."
Keeping up the Momentum and Working Together for A New Chapter in China-CEEC Cooperation – Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the China-CEEC Summit,Xi Jinping,"Feb 9, 2021","Nine years on, China-CEEC cooperation has stood the test of time and intricate changes in the international landscape. It has developed some principles that are reflective of its distinctive features and accepted by all parties."
Keeping up the Momentum and Working Together for A New Chapter in China-CEEC Cooperation – Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the China-CEEC Summit,Xi Jinping,"Feb 9, 2021","First, making decisions through consultation. China-CEEC cooperation is based on mutual respect and has no political strings attached. All countries involved, regardless of their size, are equal partners in a cooperation mechanism featuring extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits. Guided by the conviction that “17 plus 1 could make more than 18”, we have set up a multi-dimensional cooperation framework led by the leaders’ summit and covering 20-plus sectors to ensure the participation of all CEE countries. Mindful of each other’s concerns, we have drawn up plans and decided on projects based on the national reality of each country, and encouraged all countries to find the best way to leverage their respective strengths in cooperation."
Keeping up the Momentum and Working Together for A New Chapter in China-CEEC Cooperation – Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the China-CEEC Summit,Xi Jinping,"Feb 9, 2021","Second, delivering benefits to all cooperation partners. With its focus on real results, China-CEEC cooperation has served the purpose of supporting our respective development and bettering the lives of our people. To make our cooperation more balanced, we have pursued both economic cooperation and cultural exchanges, placed equal importance on trade and investment, and made sure that the fruits of cooperation are shared by all countries and communities. Today, trade between China and CEE countries is nearly 85 percent bigger than nine years ago, and growth in China’s import from CEE countries is 22 percentage points higher than that of export. The number of mutual tourist visits has grown nearly five times. The China-Europe Railway Express has reached most of the CEE countries, running more than 30,000 freight services so far. Impressive progress has been made in a number of cooperation projects, including the Port of Piraeus in Greece, the Smederevo Steel Plant in Serbia, and the Peljesac Bridge in Croatia."
Keeping up the Momentum and Working Together for A New Chapter in China-CEEC Cooperation – Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the China-CEEC Summit,Xi Jinping,"Feb 9, 2021","Third, pursuing common development through openness and inclusiveness. China and CEE countries share the conviction that openness brings opportunities and inclusiveness ensures diversity. This is the key to the sustained vibrancy of China-CEEC cooperation. We have drawn on each other’s strengths through mutual learning, and narrowed differences and resolved disagreements through consultation and cooperation. We have followed widely-accepted international rules, conformed to market principles, and respected EU standards in our cooperation. We also welcome the participation of other countries and international organizations in our cooperation to achieve win-win results."
Keeping up the Momentum and Working Together for A New Chapter in China-CEEC Cooperation – Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the China-CEEC Summit,Xi Jinping,"Feb 9, 2021","Fourth, achieving bigger growth through innovation. Acting in an innovative and pioneering spirit, we have taken steps early on to explore the possibility of aligning cross-regional cooperation with Belt and Road cooperation, making Central and Eastern Europe the first region where all countries have signed agreements on Belt and Road cooperation. In light of the needs and unique geographical locations of CEE countries, we have worked hard for good progress in the Budapest-Belgrade Railway and other major cooperation projects."

Keeping up the Momentum and Working Together for A New Chapter in China-CEEC Cooperation – Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the China-CEEC Summit,Xi Jinping,"Feb 9, 2021","We are living in challenging times. Changes unseen in a century, coupled with the global COVID-19 pandemic, have had a far-reaching impact. In the face of such unprecedented challenges, countries must come together and respond with solidarity and coordination like never before."
Keeping up the Momentum and Working Together for A New Chapter in China-CEEC Cooperation – Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the China-CEEC Summit,Xi Jinping,"Feb 9, 2021","In 2020, overall China-EU relations made new progress despite the challenges caused by the pandemic. The two sides concluded negotiations on the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment on schedule, signed an agreement on geographical indications, and launched partnerships for green and digital cooperation. The two sides also stood firm for multilateralism and took on global challenges together. China-CEEC cooperation is part and parcel of China-EU relations, whose good progress means new opportunities for China-CEEC cooperation."
Keeping up the Momentum and Working Together for A New Chapter in China-CEEC Cooperation – Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the China-CEEC Summit,Xi Jinping,"Feb 9, 2021","Colleagues,"
Keeping up the Momentum and Working Together for A New Chapter in China-CEEC Cooperation – Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the China-CEEC Summit,Xi Jinping,"Feb 9, 2021","China-CEEC cooperation is a cross-regional cooperation platform with important influence. Under the new circumstances, what could we do to take our cooperation forward? I want to share with you the following four thoughts of suggestion."
Keeping up the Momentum and Working Together for A New Chapter in China-CEEC Cooperation – Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the China-CEEC Summit,Xi Jinping,"Feb 9, 2021","First, we need to tackle COVID-19 head on and boost confidence in cooperation to tide over the tough times. Fighting the pandemic is currently the most pressing task for us. To complete this task, China will work with CEE countries through solidarity, coordination and cooperation. Our two sides could enhance joint response and share experience on prevention and treatment, explore cooperation on traditional medicine, and scale up public health and medical cooperation. These efforts will contribute to a global community of health for all. China will continue to provide vaccines to countries in need to the best of its capability, and do what it can to make vaccines a global public good and promote their equitable distribution and application around the world. China stands ready for vaccine cooperation with CEE countries. So far, Serbia has received one million doses of vaccines from a Chinese company, and there is ongoing cooperation between Hungary and Chinese vaccine companies. China will actively consider such cooperation with other CEE countries if there is the need."
Keeping up the Momentum and Working Together for A New Chapter in China-CEEC Cooperation – Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the China-CEEC Summit,Xi Jinping,"Feb 9, 2021","We need to stay committed to open cooperation. We need to promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, work to build an open world economy and move the world economy out of the shadow of crisis as early as possible. The priority for the time being is to coordinate COVID response and economic and social development, resume travels and economic activities in a prudent and orderly manner, and keep industrial and supply chains stable, so as to bolster our efforts to contain the coronavirus and revive the economy."
Keeping up the Momentum and Working Together for A New Chapter in China-CEEC Cooperation – Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the China-CEEC Summit,Xi Jinping,"Feb 9, 2021","Second, we need to focus on connectivity and develop smooth avenues of cooperation for interconnected development. We need to keep improving connectivity as a solid foundation for interconnected development at a higher level. We could pursue high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, speed up such major projects such as the Budapest-Belgrade Railway, and continue to support the development of the China-Europe Railway Express to unlock the full potential of our cooperation."
Keeping up the Momentum and Working Together for A New Chapter in China-CEEC Cooperation – Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the China-CEEC Summit,Xi Jinping,"Feb 9, 2021","It is also important that we deepen customs cooperation to ensure trade security and faster clearance. China will work toward the establishment of a China-CEEC customs information center and a focal point for customs clearance coordination for countries along the China-Europe Land-Sea Express Line. We could also explore cooperation on a pilot basis under the “Smart Customs, Smart Borders and Smart Connectivity” Initiative."
Keeping up the Momentum and Working Together for A New Chapter in China-CEEC Cooperation – Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the China-CEEC Summit,Xi Jinping,"Feb 9, 2021","Third, we need to aim for concrete results and increase cooperation outcomes that benefit both sides. China will work with CEE countries to help the region share in the benefits of China-EU cooperation as early as possible. More should be done toward mutually-beneficial trade and investment cooperation to promote balanced and sustainable trade growth. China intends to import, in the coming five years, more than 170 billion US dollars of goods from CEE countries. Platforms like the China International Import Expo and the China-CEEC Expo would be better leveraged for China to import more goods from CEE countries; and measures will be taken to set up a China-CEEC sanitary and phytosanitary working group mechanism and a focal point for inspection and quarantine affairs and to merge risk assessment procedures on a category basis, in order to refine the assessment process for agri-food products from CEE countries and speed up their entry into China. We could also strengthen business cooperation at the sub-national level and continue to develop demonstration zones and industrial parks for China-CEEC business cooperation in Chinese cities like Ningbo and Cangzhou."
Keeping up the Momentum and Working Together for A New Chapter in China-CEEC Cooperation – Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the China-CEEC Summit,Xi Jinping,"Feb 9, 2021",We need to deepen agricultural cooperation in a bid to double CEE countries’ agricultural exports to China and raise two-way agricultural trade by 50 percent over the next five years. We propose setting up a farm produce wholesale market in the CEE region and introducing an exchange program for young agricultural professionals.
Keeping up the Momentum and Working Together for A New Chapter in China-CEEC Cooperation – Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the China-CEEC Summit,Xi Jinping,"Feb 9, 2021","We need to enhance exchange and cooperation in culture, education, tourism, sports, media and press, and among think tanks, young people and sub-national entities. The Beijing 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games are a good opportunity for strengthening China-CEEC cooperation in the sports field. We will hold a new round of Education Policy Dialogue and Higher Education Institutes Consortium meetings this year, and support establishing a university in Hungary by Fudan University. The two sides could jointly develop more tourism products with local features and co-organize training of tourism professionals. The outcomes of the fifth China-CEEC Local Leaders’ Meeting should be fully implemented to produce more fruits from sub-national cooperation."
Keeping up the Momentum and Working Together for A New Chapter in China-CEEC Cooperation – Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the China-CEEC Summit,Xi Jinping,"Feb 9, 2021","Fourth, we need to focus on green development and forge drivers of future-oriented cooperation. On the basis of our “green consensus”, we need to steadfastly advance international cooperation on climate change, jointly implement the Paris Agreement and contribute to the success of COP26 of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and COP15 of the Convention on Biological Diversity, both to be held this year. To enhance green development, we may take the China-CEEC Year of Green Development and Environmental Protection as an opportunity to deepen exchange and cooperation in green economy, clean energy and other related areas."
Keeping up the Momentum and Working Together for A New Chapter in China-CEEC Cooperation – Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the China-CEEC Summit,Xi Jinping,"Feb 9, 2021","We need to step up cooperation in science, technology and innovation (STI). China proposes setting up a China-CEEC STI Research Center and holding a China-CEEC Forum for Young S&T Talents, and will publish the China-CEEC STI Scorecard 2020. We need to capitalize on various emerging business forms to widen our cooperation on the digital economy, e-commerce and the health sector. China supports setting up a China-CEEC dialogue mechanism on e-commerce cooperation and a China-CEEC alliance in the public health industry."
Keeping up the Momentum and Working Together for A New Chapter in China-CEEC Cooperation – Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the China-CEEC Summit,Xi Jinping,"Feb 9, 2021","Colleagues,"
Keeping up the Momentum and Working Together for A New Chapter in China-CEEC Cooperation – Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the China-CEEC Summit,Xi Jinping,"Feb 9, 2021","This year will be the beginning of China’s 14th Five-Year Plan for economic and social development, and the start of the country’s new journey toward fully building a modern socialist country. Entering a new stage of development, China will quicken its pace in fostering a new development paradigm with domestic circulation as the mainstay and domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other. This will unlock the full potential of China’s vast market and domestic demand generated by the 1.4 billion population, including the over 400 million Chinese in the middle-income group. It will thus boost global demand and create more opportunities for the rest of the world. China will continue to open its door wider, with a focus on institutional opening-up that covers rules, regulations, management and standards. We will continue our efforts to foster a business environment that is based on market principles, governed by law and up to international standards. We will take a more active part in bilateral, multilateral and regional cooperation that delivers higher levels of mutual benefit for all. China’s continued development and opening-up will inject powerful impetus into global economic recovery and growth, and broaden the horizons for China-CEEC cooperation."

Keeping up the Momentum and Working Together for A New Chapter in China-CEEC Cooperation – Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the China-CEEC Summit,Xi Jinping,"Feb 9, 2021","As a saying in Central and Eastern Europe goes, “Good advice is better than gold.” I hope our discussion today will build on our consensus and draw a new blueprint for China-CEEC cooperation under the new circumstances. With our shared commitment and efforts, we will surely achieve more solid, substantive and enduring progress in the cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European countries."

COVID-19, which caught us all by surprise, has hit countries hard and dealt a heavy blow to the world economy. As scheduled and confident in the containment protocols that have been put in place, China is hosting this global trade event. It demonstrates China’s sincere desire to share its market opportunities with the world and contribute to global economic recovery."
Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the Opening Ceremony of the Third China International Import Expo,Xi Jinping,"Nov 4, 2020","Over the past three years since its inception, the CIIE has enabled exhibits to become traded goods and exhibitors to spot more investment opportunities. It has facilitated an exchange of new and creative ideas, and better connected China and the wider world. Acting as a major platform for international procurement, for investment promotion, for cultural exchange and for open cooperation, the CIIE is now an international public good for the world to share."
Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the Opening Ceremony of the Third China International Import Expo,Xi Jinping,"Nov 4, 2020","This year, the CIIE has drawn a large number of businesses around the globe. The exhibition area has expanded by nearly 30,000 square meters. A zone on public health and epidemic prevention has been added, which alone has attracted many Fortune Global 500 corporations and leading firms in relevant sectors.

Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the Opening Ceremony of the Third China International Import Expo,Xi Jinping,"Nov 4, 2020","Notwithstanding COVID-19, the pace of opening up in China has continued to quicken this year. The measures I announced at last year’s CIIE have been implemented to the full. China has taken steady steps to expand imports, with imports of goods and services outpacing the global average over the past year. The items on the national negative list for foreign investment have been cut from 40 to 33. The number of pilot free trade zones has increased from 18 to 21. The Master Plan for the Development of Hainan Free Trade Port and the Implementation Plan for Further Reform and Opening-up in Shenzhen have both been released and taken effect. Good progress has been registered in concluding high-standard free trade agreements, developing demonstration zones for creative promotion of import trade, protecting intellectual property rights, and advancing high-quality Belt and Road cooperation."

Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the Opening Ceremony of the Third China International Import Expo,Xi Jinping,"Nov 4, 2020","The overwhelming trend for countries to move toward openness and cooperation remains unchanged. All countries need to come together to jointly tackle risks and challenges, strengthen cooperation and communication, and embrace greater openness."
Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the Opening Ceremony of the Third China International Import Expo,Xi Jinping,"Nov 4, 2020","— We need to commit to mutual opening up that features shared benefits. COVID-19 is a stark reminder that all countries are in a community with a shared future. No one can stay immune in a major crisis. Solidarity and cooperation is the right choice to make in meeting challenges. We must uphold the principle of mutually beneficial cooperation. We need to build trust rather than second-guess each other; we need to join hands rather than throw punches at each other; and we need to consult rather than slander each other. Bearing in mind the common interests that bind us all, countries need to work together to make economic globalization more open, inclusive and balanced for the benefits of all."
Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the Opening Ceremony of the Third China International Import Expo,Xi Jinping,"Nov 4, 2020","— We need to commit to mutual opening up that features shared responsibilities. Both history and reality tell us that when confronted by risks and challenges, countries must work together as partners, with each shouldering its due responsibility. It is ill-advised to pursue unilateral dominance, or choose to hurt others’ interests, which diminishes one’s own interests. Big countries need to lead by example, major economies need to act on sound principles, and developing countries need to play an active part in promoting opening up and sharing responsibilities. It is by working together that we will advance common development of our world."
Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the Opening Ceremony of the Third China International Import Expo,Xi Jinping,"Nov 4, 2020","— We need to commit to mutual opening up that features shared governance. Faced with the challenges brought by economic globalization, we must not allow unilateralism or protectionism to undermine the international order and international rules. Rather, we need to reform the global economic governance system in a constructive way to better seize opportunities and avoid harm. Guided by a vision of global governance based on extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, we need to safeguard the multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization (WTO) as its cornerstone, improve the rules of global economic governance, and build an open world economy."

Very soon, China will achieve the goal of finishing building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and eradicating poverty. From next year on, China will begin a new journey toward fully building a modern socialist country. It will mark a new stage for China’s development. Answering to the changing circumstances and new requirements, we have set out to foster a new development paradigm with domestic circulation as the mainstay and domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other. What we envision is not a development loop behind closed doors, but more open domestic and international circulations. We will do so not only to meet China’s own development needs but also for the greater benefit of people in all countries."
Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the Opening Ceremony of the Third China International Import Expo,Xi Jinping,"Nov 4, 2020",China has a population of 1.4 billion and a middle-income group that exceeds 400 million.

Demand on the massive domestic market in China will continue to unleash endless potential for innovation.

Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the Opening Ceremony of the Third China International Import Expo,Xi Jinping,"Nov 4, 2020","COVID-19 has put all countries through a tough test. In the case of China, our people have exerted extraordinary efforts and made major strategic gains in controlling the coronavirus. The Chinese economy is steadily picking up, as evidenced by the positive overall growth in the first three quarters, including a 0.7% growth in foreign trade and a 5.2% rise in paid-in foreign investment. This is a major contribution to economic recovery in the world. What’s more, out of solidarity with other countries in fighting COVID-19, the Chinese people have shared full experience and done our best to assist the international community. As of 20th October, China had provided assistance to 150 countries and seven international organizations and exported over 179 billion masks, 1.73 billion protective suits, and 543 million testing kits. This is how China has acted out its responsibility."
Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the Opening Ceremony of the Third China International Import Expo,Xi Jinping,"Nov 4, 2020","Going forward, China will stay committed to openness, cooperation and unity for win-win results. We will steadfastly expand all-round opening up and explore more efficient ways to connect domestic and foreign markets and share factors of production and resources. Our aim is to turn the China market into a market for the world, a market shared by all, and a market accessible to all. This way, we will be able to bring more positive energy to the global community."
Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the Opening Ceremony of the Third China International Import Expo,Xi Jinping,"Nov 4, 2020","First, China will nurture new pacesetters of opening up. Over the past seven years, in pilot free trade zones in China, a lot has been done to break new ground and bold experiments have produced remarkable results. The Hainan Free Trade Port has been kicked off to a good start. China will continue to leverage the pioneering role of pilot free trade zones and free trade ports in steering opening up. We will introduce a negative list for cross-border services trade and open still wider in areas like the digital economy and the Internet. We will deepen reform and innovation in trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, and make institutional innovations to support an open economy of higher standards."
Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the Opening Ceremony of the Third China International Import Expo,Xi Jinping,"Nov 4, 2020","Second, China will pursue creative ways to grow foreign trade. Through the CIIE and other platforms of opening up, we will continue to support companies from around the world in exploring business opportunities in China. We will tap into the growth potential of foreign trade with a view to boosting growth in international trade and the world economy. China will encourage cross-border e-commerce and other new business forms and models to grow even quicker to foster new drivers of foreign trade. China will shorten its catalog of technologies prohibited or restricted from import to create a favorable environment for the free flow of technologies across borders."
Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the Opening Ceremony of the Third China International Import Expo,Xi Jinping,"Nov 4, 2020","Third, China will keep improving its business environment. In the wake of COVID-19, China has adopted a range of pro-business relief policies that apply equally to all companies registered in China. Earlier this year, the Foreign Investment Law and its supporting rules and regulations came into effect, and the negative list on foreign investment was cut still shorter. China will continue to make its foreign-related legal framework more open and transparent, strengthen intellectual property protection, better protect the lawful rights and interests of foreign investors and provide them with more high-quality services to further improve the business environment."
Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the Opening Ceremony of the Third China International Import Expo,Xi Jinping,"Nov 4, 2020","Fourth, China will pursue deeper bilateral, multilateral and regional cooperation. China stands ready to conclude high-standard free trade agreements with more countries in the world. We will work for the early signing of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and speed up negotiations on a China-EU investment treaty and a China-Japan-ROK free trade agreement. We look forward to more exchanges and mutual learning with high-standard free trade zones in other parts of the world. China will take an active part in WTO reform and in cooperation at the United Nations, the G20, APEC, BRICS and other fora. China will work with partner countries to promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation and build a community with a shared future for mankind."

Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the Opening Ceremony of the Third China International Import Expo,Xi Jinping,"Nov 4, 2020","As we often say in China, “Those who do not make their way to the Great Wall are not true heroes.” Now, at a time of formidable challenges facing the world economy, it is imperative that we bolster confidence and courage to tide over this difficult period together. China will join hands with all other countries to create opportunities in opening up, tackle difficult problems through cooperation, and foster a brighter future for humanity."

Let the Torch of Multilateralism Light up Humanity’s Way Forward: Special Address by Xi Jinping at the World Economic Forum Virtual Event of the Davos Agenda,Xi Jinping,"Jan 25, 2021",The past year was marked by the sudden onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic. Global public health faced severe threat and the world economy was mired in deep recession. Humanity encountered multiple crises rarely seen in human history.
Let the Torch of Multilateralism Light up Humanity’s Way Forward: Special Address by Xi Jinping at the World Economic Forum Virtual Event of the Davos Agenda,Xi Jinping,"Jan 25, 2021","The past year also bore witness to the enormous resolve and courage of people around the world in battling the deadly coronavirus. Guided by science, reason and a humanitarian spirit, the world has achieved initial progress in fighting COVID-19. That said, the pandemic is far from over. The recent resurgence in COVID cases reminds us that we must carry on the fight. Yet we remain convinced that winter cannot stop the arrival of spring and darkness can never shroud the light of dawn. There is no doubt that humanity will prevail over the virus and emerge even stronger from this disaster."
Let the Torch of Multilateralism Light up Humanity’s Way Forward: Special Address by Xi Jinping at the World Economic Forum Virtual Event of the Davos Agenda,Xi Jinping,"Jan 25, 2021","Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends,"
Let the Torch of Multilateralism Light up Humanity’s Way Forward: Special Address by Xi Jinping at the World Economic Forum Virtual Event of the Davos Agenda,Xi Jinping,"Jan 25, 2021",History is moving forward and the world will not go back to what it was in the past. Every choice and move we make today will shape the world of the future. It is important that we properly address the four major tasks facing people of our times.
Let the Torch of Multilateralism Light up Humanity’s Way Forward: Special Address by Xi Jinping at the World Economic Forum Virtual Event of the Davos Agenda,Xi Jinping,"Jan 25, 2021","The first is to step up macroeconomic policy coordination and jointly promote strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth of the world economy. We are going through the worst recession since the end of World War II. For the first time in history, the economies of all regions have been hit hard at the same time, with global industrial and supply chains clogged and trade and investment down in the doldrums. Despite the trillions of dollars in relief packages worldwide, global recovery is rather shaky and the outlook remains uncertain. We need to focus on current priorities, and balance COVID response and economic development. Macroeconomic policy support should be stepped up to bring the world economy out of the woods as early as possible. More importantly, we need to look beyond the horizon and strengthen our will and resolve for change. We need to shift the driving forces and growth models of the global economy and improve its structure, so as to set the course for long-term, sound and steady development of the world economy."
Let the Torch of Multilateralism Light up Humanity’s Way Forward: Special Address by Xi Jinping at the World Economic Forum Virtual Event of the Davos Agenda,Xi Jinping,"Jan 25, 2021","The second is to abandon ideological prejudice and jointly follow a path of peaceful coexistence, mutual benefit and win-win cooperation. No two leaves in the world are identical, and no histories, cultures or social systems are the same. Each country is unique with its own history, culture and social system, and none is superior to the other. The best criteria are whether a country’s history, culture and social system fit its particular situation, enjoy people’s support, serve to deliver political stability, social progress and better lives, and contribute to human progress. The different histories, cultures and social systems are as old as human societies, and they are the inherent features of human civilization. There will be no human civilization without diversity, and such diversity will continue to exist for as long as we can imagine. Difference in itself is no cause for alarm. What does ring the alarm is arrogance, prejudice and hatred; it is the attempt to impose hierarchy on human civilization or to force one’s own history, culture and social system upon others. The right choice is for countries to pursue peaceful coexistence based on mutual respect and on expanding common ground while shelving differences, and to promote exchanges and mutual learning. This is the way to add impetus to the progress of human civilization."
Let the Torch of Multilateralism Light up Humanity’s Way Forward: Special Address by Xi Jinping at the World Economic Forum Virtual Event of the Davos Agenda,Xi Jinping,"Jan 25, 2021","The third is to close the divide between developed and developing countries and jointly bring about growth and prosperity for all. Today, inequality continues to grow, the North-South gap remains to be bridged, and sustainable development faces severe challenges. As countries grapple with the pandemic, their economic recoveries are following divergent trajectories, and the North-South gap risks further widening and even perpetuation. For developing countries, they are aspiring for more resources and space for development, and they are calling for stronger representation and voice in global economic governance. We should recognize that with the growth of developing countries, global prosperity and stability will be put on a more solid footing, and developed countries will stand to benefit from such growth. The international community should keep its eyes on the long run, honor its commitment, and provide necessary support to developing countries and safeguard their legitimate development interests. Equal rights, equal opportunities and equal rules should be strengthened, so that all countries will benefit from the opportunities and fruits of development."
Let the Torch of Multilateralism Light up Humanity’s Way Forward: Special Address by Xi Jinping at the World Economic Forum Virtual Event of the Davos Agenda,Xi Jinping,"Jan 25, 2021","The fourth is to come together against global challenges and jointly create a better future for humanity. In the era of economic globalization, public health emergencies like COVID-19 may very well recur, and global public health governance needs to be enhanced. The Earth is our one and only home. To scale up efforts to address climate change and promote sustainable development bears on the future of humanity. No global problem can be solved by any one country alone. There must be global action, global response and global cooperation."
Let the Torch of Multilateralism Light up Humanity’s Way Forward: Special Address by Xi Jinping at the World Economic Forum Virtual Event of the Davos Agenda,Xi Jinping,"Jan 25, 2021","Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends,"
Let the Torch of Multilateralism Light up Humanity’s Way Forward: Special Address by Xi Jinping at the World Economic Forum Virtual Event of the Davos Agenda,Xi Jinping,"Jan 25, 2021",The problems facing the world are intricate and complex. The way out of them is through upholding multilateralism and building a community with a shared future for mankind.
Let the Torch of Multilateralism Light up Humanity’s Way Forward: Special Address by Xi Jinping at the World Economic Forum Virtual Event of the Davos Agenda,Xi Jinping,"Jan 25, 2021","First, we should stay committed to openness and inclusiveness instead of closeness and exclusion. Multilateralism is about having international affairs addressed through consultation and the future of the world decided by everyone working together. To build small circles or start a new Cold War, to reject, threaten or intimidate others, to willfully impose decoupling, supply disruption or sanctions, and to create isolation or estrangement will only push the world into division and even confrontation. We cannot tackle common challenges in a divided world, and confrontation will lead us to a dead end. Humanity has learned lessons the hard way, and that history is not long gone. We must not return to the path of the past."
Let the Torch of Multilateralism Light up Humanity’s Way Forward: Special Address by Xi Jinping at the World Economic Forum Virtual Event of the Davos Agenda,Xi Jinping,"Jan 25, 2021","The right approach is to act on the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind. We should uphold the common values of humanity, i.e. peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, rise above ideological prejudice, make the mechanisms, principles and policies of our cooperation as open and inclusive as possible, and jointly safeguard world peace and stability. We should build an open world economy, uphold the multilateral trading regime, discard discriminatory and exclusionary standards, rules and systems, and take down barriers to trade, investment and technological exchanges. We should strengthen the G20 as the premier forum for global economic governance, engage in closer macroeconomic policy coordination, and keep the global industrial and supply chains stable and open. We should ensure the sound operation of the global financial system, promote structural reform and expand global aggregate demand in an effort to strive for higher quality and stronger resilience in global economic development."
Let the Torch of Multilateralism Light up Humanity’s Way Forward: Special Address by Xi Jinping at the World Economic Forum Virtual Event of the Davos Agenda,Xi Jinping,"Jan 25, 2021","Second, we should stay committed to international law and international rules instead of seeking one’s own supremacy. Ancient Chinese believed that “the law is the very foundation of governance”. International governance should be based on the rules and consensus reached among us, not on the order given by one or the few. The Charter of the United Nations is the basic and universally recognized norms governing state-to-state relations. Without international law and international rules that are formed and recognized by the global community, the world may fall back to the law of the jungle, and the consequence would be devastating for humanity."
Let the Torch of Multilateralism Light up Humanity’s Way Forward: Special Address by Xi Jinping at the World Economic Forum Virtual Event of the Davos Agenda,Xi Jinping,"Jan 25, 2021","We need to be resolute in championing the international rule of law, and steadfast in our resolve to safeguard the international system centered around the UN and the international order based on international law. Multilateral institutions, which provide the platforms for putting multilateralism into action and which are the basic architecture underpinning multilateralism, should have their authority and effectiveness safeguarded. State-to-state relations should be coordinated and regulated through proper institutions and rules. The strong should not bully the weak. Decision should not be made by simply showing off strong muscles or waving a big fist. Multilateralism should not be used as pretext for acts of unilateralism. Principles should be preserved and rules, once made, should be followed by all. “Selective multilateralism” should not be our option."
Let the Torch of Multilateralism Light up Humanity’s Way Forward: Special Address by Xi Jinping at the World Economic Forum Virtual Event of the Davos Agenda,Xi Jinping,"Jan 25, 2021","Third, we should stay committed to consultation and cooperation instead of conflict and confrontation. Differences in history, culture and social system should not be an excuse for antagonism or confrontation, but rather an incentive for cooperation. We should respect and accommodate differences, avoid meddling in other countries’ internal affairs, and resolve disagreements through consultation and dialogue. History and reality have made it clear, time and again, that the misguided approach of antagonism and confrontation, be it in the form of cold war, hot war, trade war or tech war, would eventually hurt all countries’ interests and undermine everyone’s well-being."
Let the Torch of Multilateralism Light up Humanity’s Way Forward: Special Address by Xi Jinping at the World Economic Forum Virtual Event of the Davos Agenda,Xi Jinping,"Jan 25, 2021","We should reject the outdated Cold War and zero-sum game mentality, adhere to mutual respect and accommodation, and enhance political trust through strategic communication. It is important that we stick to the cooperation concept based on mutual benefit, say no to narrow-minded, selfish beggar-thy-neighbor policies, and stop unilateral practice of keeping advantages in development all to oneself. Equal rights to development should be guaranteed for all countries to promote common development and prosperity. We should advocate fair competition, like competing with each other for excellence in a racing field, not beating each other on a wrestling arena."
Let the Torch of Multilateralism Light up Humanity’s Way Forward: Special Address by Xi Jinping at the World Economic Forum Virtual Event of the Davos Agenda,Xi Jinping,"Jan 25, 2021","Fourth, we should stay committed to keeping up with the times instead of rejecting change. The world is undergoing changes unseen in a century, and now is the time for major development and major transformation. To uphold multilateralism in the 21st century, we should promote its fine tradition, take on new perspectives and look to the future. We need to stand by the core values and basic principles of multilateralism. We also need to adapt to the changing international landscape and respond to global challenges as they arise. We need to reform and improve the global governance system on the basis of extensive consultation and consensus-building."
Let the Torch of Multilateralism Light up Humanity’s Way Forward: Special Address by Xi Jinping at the World Economic Forum Virtual Event of the Davos Agenda,Xi Jinping,"Jan 25, 2021","We need to give full play to the role of the World Health Organization in building a global community of health for all. We need to advance reform of the World Trade Organization and the international financial and monetary system in a way that boosts global economic growth and protects the development rights, interests and opportunities of developing countries. We need to follow a people-centered and fact-based policy orientation in exploring and formulating rules on global digital governance. We need to deliver on the Paris Agreement on climate change and promote green development. We need to give continued priority to development, implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and make sure that all countries, especially developing ones, share in the fruits of global development."
Let the Torch of Multilateralism Light up Humanity’s Way Forward: Special Address by Xi Jinping at the World Economic Forum Virtual Event of the Davos Agenda,Xi Jinping,"Jan 25, 2021","Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends,"
Let the Torch of Multilateralism Light up Humanity’s Way Forward: Special Address by Xi Jinping at the World Economic Forum Virtual Event of the Davos Agenda,Xi Jinping,"Jan 25, 2021","After decades of strenuous efforts by the Chinese people, China is on course to finish building a moderately prosperous society in all respects. We have made historic gains in ending extreme poverty, and have embarked on a new journey toward fully building a modern socialist country. As China enters a new development stage, we will follow a new development philosophy and foster a new development paradigm with domestic circulation as the mainstay and domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other. China will work with other countries to build an open, inclusive, clean and beautiful world that enjoys lasting peace, universal security and common prosperity."
Let the Torch of Multilateralism Light up Humanity’s Way Forward: Special Address by Xi Jinping at the World Economic Forum Virtual Event of the Davos Agenda,Xi Jinping,"Jan 25, 2021","— China will continue to take an active part in international cooperation on COVID-19. Containing the coronavirus is the most pressing task for the international community. This is because people and their lives must always be put before anything else. It is also what it takes to stabilize and revive the economy. Closer solidarity and cooperation, more information sharing, and a stronger global response are what we need to defeat COVID-19 across the world. It is especially important to scale up cooperation on the R&D, production and distribution of vaccines and make them public goods that are truly accessible and affordable to people in all countries. By now, China has provided assistance to over 150 countries and 13 international organizations, sent 36 medical expert teams to countries in need, and stayed strongly supportive and actively engaged in international cooperation on COVID vaccines. China will continue to share its experience with other countries, do its best to assist countries and regions that are less prepared for the pandemic, and work for greater accessibility and affordability of COVID vaccines in developing countries. We hope these efforts will contribute to an early and complete victory over the coronavirus throughout the world."
Let the Torch of Multilateralism Light up Humanity’s Way Forward: Special Address by Xi Jinping at the World Economic Forum Virtual Event of the Davos Agenda,Xi Jinping,"Jan 25, 2021","— China will continue to implement a win-win strategy of opening-up. Economic globalization meets the need of growing social productivity and is a natural outcome of scientific and technological advancement. It serves no one’s interest to use the pandemic as an excuse to reverse globalization and go for seclusion and decoupling. As a longstanding supporter of economic globalization, China is committed to following through on its fundamental policy of opening-up. China will continue to promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, help keep the global industrial and supply chains smooth and stable, and advance high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. China will promote institutional opening-up that covers rules, regulations, management and standards. We will foster a business environment that is based on market principles, governed by law and up to international standards, and unleash the potential of the huge China market and enormous domestic demand. We hope these efforts will bring more cooperation opportunities to other countries and give further impetus to global economic recovery and growth."
Let the Torch of Multilateralism Light up Humanity’s Way Forward: Special Address by Xi Jinping at the World Economic Forum Virtual Event of the Davos Agenda,Xi Jinping,"Jan 25, 2021","— China will continue to promote sustainable development. China will fully implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It will do more on the ecological front, by transforming and improving its industrial structure and energy mix at a faster pace and promoting a green, low-carbon way of life and production. I have announced China’s goal of striving to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. Meeting these targets will require tremendous hard work from China. Yet we believe that when the interests of the entire humanity are at stake, China must step forward, take action, and get the job done. China is drawing up action plans and taking specific measures already to make sure we meet the set targets. We are doing this as a concrete action to uphold multilateralism and as a contribution to protecting our shared home and realizing sustainable development of humanity."
Let the Torch of Multilateralism Light up Humanity’s Way Forward: Special Address by Xi Jinping at the World Economic Forum Virtual Event of the Davos Agenda,Xi Jinping,"Jan 25, 2021","— China will continue to advance science, technology and innovation. Science, technology and innovation is a key engine for human progress, a powerful weapon in tackling many global challenges, and the only way for China to foster a new development paradigm and achieve high-quality development. China will invest more in science and technology, develop an enabling system for innovation as a priority, turn breakthroughs in science and technology into actual productivity at a faster pace, and enhance intellectual property protection, all for the purpose of fostering innovation-driven, higher-quality growth. Scientific and technological advances should benefit all humanity rather than be used to curb and contain other countries’ development. China will think and act with more openness with regard to international exchange and cooperation on science and technology. We will work with other countries to create an open, fair, equitable and non-discriminatory environment for scientific and technological advancement that is beneficial to all and shared by all."
Let the Torch of Multilateralism Light up Humanity’s Way Forward: Special Address by Xi Jinping at the World Economic Forum Virtual Event of the Davos Agenda,Xi Jinping,"Jan 25, 2021","— China will continue to promote a new type of international relations. Zero-sum game or winner-takes-all is not the guiding philosophy of the Chinese people. As a staunch follower of an independent foreign policy of peace, China is working hard to bridge differences through dialogue and resolve disputes through negotiation and to pursue friendly and cooperative relations with other countries on the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit. As a steadfast member of developing countries, China will further deepen South-South cooperation, and contribute to the endeavor of developing countries to eradicate poverty, ease debt burden, and achieve more growth. China will get more actively engaged in global economic governance and push for an economic globalization that is more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial to all."

Major Issues Concerning China’s Strategies for Mid-to-Long-Term Economic and Social Development,Xi Jinping,"Oct 31, 2020","This is the speech by General Secretary Xi Jinping at the seventh meeting of the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission on April 10, 2020. Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, I have presided over many meanings and given a lot of instructions to promote the proper handling of epidemic control and economic and social development work. At the same time, I have also factored epidemic prevention and control into my reflections on the major issues involving the nation’s medium- and long-term economic and social development. "
Major Issues Concerning China’s Strategies for Mid-to-Long-Term Economic and Social Development,Xi Jinping,"Oct 31, 2020","The world today is going through once-in-a-century changes, and this pandemic is also something encountered once in a century. It is both a crisis and a major test. At present, China’s epidemic prevention and control situation has already turned the corner, but the global pandemic is still growing, and the external situation is very grave. We must do well at externally preventing it from entering and internally preventing it from rebounding, never allowing it to make a comeback. At the same time, we must apply what we know, do longer-term thinking, refine our strategic layout, turn dangers into opportunities, and achieve high-quality development. In the following, I will focus on several issues from a development strategy perspective. "
Major Issues Concerning China’s Strategies for Mid-to-Long-Term Economic and Social Development,Xi Jinping,"Oct 31, 2020","First, steadfastly implement the strategy of domestic demand expansion. Building a complete internal demand system bears on China’s long-term development and long-term peace and stability. Since [the beginning of] reform and opening up [in 1978], and especially after joining the WTO, China entered the international great circulation (国际大循环), formed the market and resources (such as mineral resources) “two heads overseas” and “factory of the world” development models. This has played an important role in China’s seizing of economic globalization opportunities, its rapid increase in economic strength, and the improvement of the people’s livelihoods. In recent years, economic globalization has encountered headwinds, and this pandemic may intensify counter-globalization trends. With inward-turning tendencies clearly on the rise among nations, there could be significant changes in the external environment facing China’s development. Implementing the internal demand expansion strategy is a necessity for responding to the pandemic’s impact. It is a necessity for maintaining the long-term, sustainable and healthy development of China’s economy, and it is a necessity for satisfying the people’s ever-growing demand for a high standard of living (美好生活). "
Major Issues Concerning China’s Strategies for Mid-to-Long-Term Economic and Social Development,Xi Jinping,"Oct 31, 2020","An advantage of large-country economies is the internal circulation that is possible. With a population of 1.4 billion and per capita GDP already over US$10,000, China is the world’s largest potential consumer market. Improvement and upgrading of people’s consumption, combined with modern technology and production methods, implies vast room for growth. We must firmly grasp this strategic basis that is demand expansion, make each link—production, distribution, circulation and consumption—rely more on the domestic market to achieve a virtuous circle, specify the strategic direction of supply-side structural reform, and promote the achievement of dynamic balance between aggregate supply and demand at higher levels. There is no contradiction between demand expansion and expanding opening up. The more smooth-flowing domestic circulation (国内循环) becomes, the greater the gravitational force it exerts on global resource factors, the more it facilitates building a new development pattern based on domestic great circulation (国内大循环) and mutually reinforcing domestic and international dual circulation (双循环), and the more it facilitates forming new advantages when participating in international competition and cooperation. "
Major Issues Concerning China’s Strategies for Mid-to-Long-Term Economic and Social Development,Xi Jinping,"Oct 31, 2020","Consumption is an important engine of China’s economic growth, and the middle-income group is an important foundation for consumption. At present, China has a middle-income population of approximately 400 million, far and away the largest in the world. We must make expanding the middle-income group an important policy objective, optimize the income distribution structure, and build a sound mechanism in which the contributions of knowledge, technology, management, data and other factors of production are evaluated by the market, and compensation is determined according to the contributions of each. We must expand investments in human capital, so that more ordinary laborers enter the middle-income group through their own hard work. "
Major Issues Concerning China’s Strategies for Mid-to-Long-Term Economic and Social Development,Xi Jinping,"Oct 31, 2020","Second, optimize and stabilize production chains and supply chains. Production chains (产业链) and supply chains cannot come uncoupled at critical times. This is an important characteristic that all large economies must possess. The current epidemic is a stress test under actual combat conditions. China’s perfected industrial system and strong mobilization and industry transformation capability have provided important material support for epidemic prevention and control. China increased its daily face mask production capacity from ten million at the end of January to 500 million currently [April 10, 2020]. At the same time, the epidemic’s impact has exposed hidden risks in China’s production chains and supply chains. In order to safeguard China’s industrial security and national security, we must focus on building production chains and supply chains that are independently controllable (自主可控), secure and reliable, and strive for important products and supply channels to all have at least one alternative source, forming the necessary industrial backup system. "
Major Issues Concerning China’s Strategies for Mid-to-Long-Term Economic and Social Development,Xi Jinping,"Oct 31, 2020","The entire country is now getting back to work and resuming production. We should not and cannot simply repeat past patterns. Rather, we must work hard to refashion them into new production chains, and increase the levels of S&T innovation and import substitution across the board. This is an important focus for deepening supply-side structural reform, and is key for high-quality development. First, we must build on our advantages, solidify and increase the leading international positions of strong industries, and forge some “assassin’s mace” technologies. We must sustain and enhance our superiority across the entire production chain in sectors such as high-speed rail, electric power equipment, new energy, and communications equipment, and improve industrial quality; and we must tighten international production chains’ dependence on China, forming powerful countermeasures and deterrent capabilities based on artificially cutting off supply to foreigners. Second, we must make up for our shortcomings. That is, in sectors and segments related to national security, we must build a domestic supply system that is independently controllable and secure and reliable, so that self-circulation (自我循环) can be accomplished at critical moments, and ensure that the economy operates normally in extreme situations. "
Major Issues Concerning China’s Strategies for Mid-to-Long-Term Economic and Social Development,Xi Jinping,"Oct 31, 2020","China’s online economy is world-leading, and it has played a positive role during this epidemic prevention and control period. Online office work, shopping, education and medicine are flourishing and integrating deeply with the offline economy. We must take advantage of this favorable momentum, accelerate construction of the digital economy, digital society and digital government, promote digitalization-based optimization and upgrading in all fields, actively participate in the formulation of international rules for digital currency, digital taxation, etc., and create new competitive advantages. At the same time, it must be recognized that the real economy is the foundation, and the various manufacturing industries cannot be abandoned. As a large country with a population of 1.4 billion, the focus of the food and real economy industries must be on ourselves, and this point must not be abandoned. "
Major Issues Concerning China’s Strategies for Mid-to-Long-Term Economic and Social Development,Xi Jinping,"Oct 31, 2020","For the national economy to operate normally, it is necessary to strengthen awareness of disaster prevention and preparedness. Fortune is as unpredictable as the weather, bringing people both disasters and blessings. We must vigorously strengthen the construction of disaster prevention and preparedness systems and capabilities, and be willing to spend the time and money, preferring to take many precautions even if most are never needed. In some fields, we must make proper preparations to respond to once-in-a-century disasters. We must insist on walking with both legs (两条腿走路), implement the integration of central government reserves with local government reserves, combining tangible physical reserves with production capacity reserves, and combining national reserves with enterprise and commercial reserves, and properly handle military-civil fusion (军民融合) reserves. We must optimize the types of emergency response materials and the layout of reserves, and must rationally determine the scale of reserves, increasing investment and construction efforts across the board. "
Major Issues Concerning China’s Strategies for Mid-to-Long-Term Economic and Social Development,Xi Jinping,"Oct 31, 2020","State-owned enterprises (SOEs) have rushed to the fore in the course of this epidemic. They have played important roles, and they have played a key role in promoting industrial circulation. SOEs are an important material and political foundation for socialism with Chinese characteristics. They are an important pillar and supporting force of the Party’s governance and rejuvenation of the nation, and they must be made stronger, better and larger. Of course, SOEs also require reform and optimization, but they must never be repudiated, and must never be weakened. We must uphold and refine the new structure for leveraging national capabilities (新型举国体制), and continuously strengthen leadership capacity, organizational capacity and implementation capacity. "
Major Issues Concerning China’s Strategies for Mid-to-Long-Term Economic and Social Development,Xi Jinping,"Oct 31, 2020","This period of epidemic prevention and control has made us recognize the need to protect the global public good attributes of production chains and supply chains, and resolutely oppose the politicization and weaponization of production and supply chains. In international trade talks, we must push for an international consensus and standards on protecting the security of global production and supply chains, and eliminating the interference of non-economic factors, and must strive through international cooperation to stop bad behavior that strikes at global production and supply chains. "
Major Issues Concerning China’s Strategies for Mid-to-Long-Term Economic and Social Development,Xi Jinping,"Oct 31, 2020","Third, refine the urbanization strategy. What approach should China take toward urbanization? This is a major question. The key is that we must make the safety of people’s lives and their physical health serve as fundamental goals of urban development. At present, the urbanization rate of China’s resident population has reached 60.6%, and it will rise further in the coming period. We must do better at promoting people-focused (以人为核心) urbanization, making cities healthier, safer and more livable, so they become high-quality living spaces for the masses of the people. "
Major Issues Concerning China’s Strategies for Mid-to-Long-Term Economic and Social Development,Xi Jinping,"Oct 31, 2020","Strengthening the economic and population sustenance capacity of areas with economic development advantages such as central cities and urban agglomerations—this is consistent with objective laws. At the same time, urban development cannot consider economies of scale alone. Ecology and security must be placed in more prominent positions, with overall consideration being given in urban layouts to economic needs, livelihood needs, ecological needs, and security needs. We must adhere to the people-centered (以人为中心) development ideology, and to taking the society’s overall progress and people’s overall development as the starting point. We must formulate urban development plans under the guidance of ecological civilization ideology and the concept of overall national security, build cities that are livable, resilient and smart, and establish high-quality urban ecosystems and security systems. "
Major Issues Concerning China’s Strategies for Mid-to-Long-Term Economic and Social Development,Xi Jinping,"Oct 31, 2020","The concentration of industry and population in favorable regions is an objective economic law, but the scale of urban units cannot expand without limit. At present, the population density of China’s megacities (with urban resident populations over ten million) and large cities (with urban resident populations over five million) is high overall. The density of Beijing proper and Shanghai proper are over 20,000 people per square kilometer. In Tokyo and New York City, it is only around 13,000. In the long run, cities nationwide must control population density rationally according to actual circumstances, and there must be control standards for the average population density of large cities. We must build a host of ecological and livable suburban new towns with city-industry integration, jobs-housing balance, and convenient transportation, and promote multi-centered suburban development. We must promote the orderly construction of digital cities, improve smart management capabilities, and gradually resolve the population and functional overcrowding problems of central cities. "
Major Issues Concerning China’s Strategies for Mid-to-Long-Term Economic and Social Development,Xi Jinping,"Oct 31, 2020","Local situations across China vary greatly, and it is necessary to use methods suited to local circumstances in promoting diversification of patterns among urban spaces. In densely populated regions like eastern China, we must optimize the internal spatial structures of urban agglomerations. We must rationally control the scale of large cities, and cannot blindly “make the pie bigger” (“摊大饼”). We must promote urban cluster-style development, and form network-structured urban agglomerations with more centers, more levels, and more nodes. Between cities, we must both enhance interconnectedness and ensure there are ecological and security barriers. For provinces in central and western China where conditions are right, we must consciously cultivate multi-centered cities, and avoid the pitfalls of “single-city dominance.” China has 1,881 county-level cities. Peasants (农民) going to the county seat to buy houses and clustering around county seats is a very common phenomenon. We must select, for priority development, a batch of county seats with the right conditions, strengthen policy guidance, and have them become points of support for internal demand expansion. There is enormous demand and room for development in terms of cities’ old town and old quarter renovation, underground pipeline network and parking garage construction, and services such as childcare, elder care, housekeeping, education, and health care. "
Major Issues Concerning China’s Strategies for Mid-to-Long-Term Economic and Social Development,Xi Jinping,"Oct 31, 2020","Fourth, adjust and optimize the structure of S&T inputs and outputs. This epidemic prevention and control period has been a real-life test of China’s science and technology community. The S&T front has both shown capabilities and exposed shortcomings. We must optimize the layout of S&T resources, boost S&T innovation capabilities, and follow a science and technology R&D path consistent with China’s national conditions. "
Major Issues Concerning China’s Strategies for Mid-to-Long-Term Economic and Social Development,Xi Jinping,"Oct 31, 2020","In S&T development, we must insist on being problem-oriented and goal-oriented. Ensuring the safety of people’s lives and their physical health is an important mission for the Party and the nation, and scientific research must derive major, cutting-edge science and major, breakthrough and major research topics from it. We must place greater emphasis on basic research in heredity, genetics, virology, epidemiology and immunology, accelerate R&D and technological innovation of related drugs and vaccines, and attach greater importance to applications of information and data technologies in these fields. We must emphasize top-level design, optimize the layout of basic research, bolster fields we are strong in, refine the arrangement of university major, strengthen basic curriculum education and talent development, shore up neglected and weak areas, gradually enlarge China’s basic research system, and work hard to produce more “from zero to one” original achievements. "
Major Issues Concerning China’s Strategies for Mid-to-Long-Term Economic and Social Development,Xi Jinping,"Oct 31, 2020","During this epidemic prevention and control period, many exemplary models have been formed that combine industry, universities and research institutions, and it will be well worth summarizing them carefully. We must make innovations in our mechanism for the commercialization of S&T achievements (科技成果转化), let enterprises play the main role and government play an overall planning role, promote the linking of capital, technology, applications, markets and other essential elements, work hard to resolve the organic connection problem of the basic research “first mile” and the achievement commercialization and market application “last mile,” and forge innovation chains and value chains between industry, universities and research institutions. "
Major Issues Concerning China’s Strategies for Mid-to-Long-Term Economic and Social Development,Xi Jinping,"Oct 31, 2020","Fifth, achieve the harmonious coexistence of people and nature. As I have emphasized many times, people and nature are a living community. Humankind must respect nature, conform to nature, and protect nature. This epidemic prevention and control period has made us realize more profoundly that constructing ecological civilization concerns the Millennium Plan (千年大计) for the perpetually sustainable development of the Chinese nation. We must plan economic and social development standing on the heights of harmonious coexistence between people and nature. "
Major Issues Concerning China’s Strategies for Mid-to-Long-Term Economic and Social Development,Xi Jinping,"Oct 31, 2020","Engels noted long ago: We must not “flatter ourselves overmuch on account of our human conquest over nature. For each such victory, nature takes its revenge on us.” Since the first industrial revolution, mankind’s ability to use nature has increased continuously, but excessive development also leads to decreasing biodiversity, forces wild animals to migrate and increases the spread of the pathogens that are in wild animals. Since the start of the new century, from SARS to bird flu, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the Ebola virus, to this COVID-19 epidemic, the frequency with which new infectious diseases are emerging worldwide has increased significantly. Only by better balancing the relationship between humans and nature, and protecting the balance of ecosystems, can we safeguard human health. We must deepen our appreciation of regularity in the living community of people and nature, and step up construction of ecological civilization across the board. The banner of ecological civilization must be raised high. "
Major Issues Concerning China’s Strategies for Mid-to-Long-Term Economic and Social Development,Xi Jinping,"Oct 31, 2020","More and more human activities are pressing against natural ecological boundaries and bottom lines. We must maintain safe boundaries and bottom lines for nature, forming a pattern of harmonious coexistence between people and nature. This includes both physical boundaries and invisible boundaries. We must refine the spatial planning of the nation’s lands, properly implement the Major Functional Zone (主体功能区) strategy, specify ecological red lines, accelerate formation of the system of nature conservation areas, refine the biodiversity conservation network, and put reasonable spatial limits on economic and social activities. "
Major Issues Concerning China’s Strategies for Mid-to-Long-Term Economic and Social Development,Xi Jinping,"Oct 31, 2020","We must strengthen the ecological awareness of all ethnic groups (民族), encourage green production and consumption, and promote the formation of healthy approaches to civilized production and living. We must thoroughly carry out patriotic health activities, promote a healthy food culture and good living habits, and crack down on illegal hunting and trading of wild animals. "
Major Issues Concerning China’s Strategies for Mid-to-Long-Term Economic and Social Development,Xi Jinping,"Oct 31, 2020","Sixth, strengthen construction of the public health system. China’s public health services have made universally recognized achievements, but this epidemic prevention and control period has also reflected some shortcomings in China’s public health sectors, and efforts to make up for them must be accelerated. "
Major Issues Concerning China’s Strategies for Mid-to-Long-Term Economic and Social Development,Xi Jinping,"Oct 31, 2020","In terms of top-level design, we must elevate the position of the public health system in the national governance system, reinforce public health institutions at the central, provincial, city and county levels, strengthen building of professional talents and teams, and increase their ability to perform their duties. We must improve the rural public health environment, and strengthen grassroots prevention and control and public health services in rural areas and communities. We must strengthen planning and construction of public health institutions, hospital infectious disease departments, biology laboratories, etc., and properly manage sensitive medical and experimental data. We must strengthen health education and scientific literacy, and raise the public health literacy of the masses. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has played an important role during this epidemic prevention and control period. We must promptly summarize experience, strengthen scientific empiricism, vigorously develop TCM services, strengthen the combination of TCM and Western medicine, and steadily raise capabilities and standards. "
Major Issues Concerning China’s Strategies for Mid-to-Long-Term Economic and Social Development,Xi Jinping,"Oct 31, 2020","As past experience at fighting major epidemics has shown, it is necessary to accelerate development of systems for early discovery, early warning and early response, and we must strive to nip epidemics in the bud. We must make reinforcing our early detection and warning capabilities the top priority for a sound public health system, and refine the public health emergency response management system. We must strengthen the sharing of information between disease control units, hospitals and scientific research organizations, and enhance our early warning capabilities for all kinds of known and emerging infectious diseases. "

Pulling Together Through Adversity and Toward a Shared Future for All: Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2021,Xi Jinping,"Apr 20, 2021","This year marks the 20th anniversary of the Boao Forum. Over these two decades, Asian countries have advanced regional economic integration and worked in unison to pursue both economic and social development, which has turned Asia into the most vibrant and promising region in the global economy. Asia has also stood with the rest of the world in the face of terrorism, the Indian Ocean tsunami, the international financial crisis, COVID-19 and other traditional and non-traditional security threats, which has helped maintain stability and security in the region. As an important member of the Asian family, China has kept deepening reform and opening-up while promoting regional cooperation, thus achieving progress and development in tandem with the rest of Asia and the world. It is fair to say that this Forum has borne witness to the extraordinary journey of China, of Asia and of the world, and has exerted a significant influence in boosting development in Asia and beyond."

Pulling Together Through Adversity and Toward a Shared Future for All: Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2021,Xi Jinping,"Apr 20, 2021",This year’s annual conference is convened against a very special background. The theme of the conference—”A World in Change: Join Hands to Strengthen Global Governance and Advance Belt and Road Cooperation”—is most opportune and relevant under the current circumstances.
Pulling Together Through Adversity and Toward a Shared Future for All: Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2021,Xi Jinping,"Apr 20, 2021","Now, the combined forces of changes and a pandemic both unseen in a century have brought the world into a phase of fluidity and transformation. Instability and uncertainty are clearly on the rise. Humanity is facing growing governance deficit, trust deficit, development deficit, and peace deficit. Much remains to be done to achieve universal security and common development. That said, there is no fundamental change in the trend toward a multi-polar world; economic globalization is showing renewed resilience; and the call for upholding multilateralism and enhancing communication and coordination has grown stronger. While we live in an age rife with challenges, it is also an age full of hope."
Pulling Together Through Adversity and Toward a Shared Future for All: Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2021,Xi Jinping,"Apr 20, 2021","Where should humanity go from here? What kind of future should we create for future generations? As we try to answer these important questions, it is crucial that we bear in mind the shared interests of mankind and make responsible and wise choices."

Pulling Together Through Adversity and Toward a Shared Future for All: Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2021,Xi Jinping,"Apr 20, 2021","— We need consultation on an equal footing to create a future of shared benefits. Global governance should reflect the evolving political and economic landscape in the world, conform to the historical trend of peace, development and win-win cooperation, and meet the practical needs in addressing global challenges. We need to follow the principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, uphold true multilateralism, and make the global governance system more fair and equitable. We need to safeguard the UN-centered international system, preserve the international order underpinned by international law, and uphold the multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization at its core. World affairs should be handled through extensive consultation, and the future of the world should be decided by all countries working together. We must not let the rules set by one or a few countries be imposed on others, or allow unilateralism pursued by certain countries to set the pace for the whole world. What we need in today’s world is justice, not hegemony. Big countries should behave in a manner befitting their status and with a greater sense of responsibility."
Pulling Together Through Adversity and Toward a Shared Future for All: Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2021,Xi Jinping,"Apr 20, 2021","— We need openness and innovation to create a future of development and prosperity. Openness is essential for development and progress. It also holds the key to post-COVID economic recovery. We need to promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, deepen regional economic integration, and enhance supply, industrial, data and human resources chains, with a view to building an open world economy. We need to deepen partnerships for connectivity and strengthen infrastructural links to keep the arteries of economic activities unclogged. We must seize the historical opportunities in a new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, boost the digital economy, and step up exchanges and cooperation in such areas as artificial intelligence, biomedicine and modern energy, so that the fruits of scientific and technological innovation can be turned into greater benefits for people in all countries. In this age of economic globalization, openness and integration is an unstoppable historical trend. Attempts to “erect walls” or “decouple” run counter to the law of economics and market principles. They would hurt others’ interests without benefiting oneself."
Pulling Together Through Adversity and Toward a Shared Future for All: Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2021,Xi Jinping,"Apr 20, 2021","— We need solidarity and cooperation to create a future of health and security. In the ongoing fight against COVID-19, victory will be ours at the end of the day. We must put people and their lives above anything else, scale up information sharing and collective efforts, enhance public health and medical cooperation, and give full play to the key role of the World Health Organization (WHO). It is important that we bolster international cooperation on the R&D, production and distribution of vaccines and increase their accessibility and affordability in developing countries so that everyone in the world can access and afford the vaccines they need. It is also important that we take comprehensive measures to improve global governance on public health security and work together for a global community of health for all. We need to follow the philosophy of green development, advance international cooperation on climate change, and do more to implement the Paris Agreement on climate change. The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities must be upheld, and concerns of developing countries on capital, technology and capacity building must be addressed."
Pulling Together Through Adversity and Toward a Shared Future for All: Keynote Speech by Xi Jinping at the Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference 2021,Xi Jinping,"Apr 20, 2021","— We need commitment to justice to create a future of mutual respect and mutual learning. Diversity is what defines our world and makes human civilization fascinating. The COVID-19 pandemic has made it all the more clear to people around the world that we must reject the cold-war and zero-sum mentality and oppose a new “Cold War” and ideological confrontation in whatever forms. In state-to-state relations, the principles of equality, mutual respect and mutual trust must be put front and center. Bossing others around or meddling in others’ internal affairs would not get one any support. We must advocate peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, which are common values of humanity, and encourage exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations to promote the progress of human civilization."

"Reflections on the Economic Development of Mindong——Interview with Comrade Xi Jinping, Secretary of the CCP Ningde Prefectural Committee",Xi Jinping,"Mar 2, 1989","Q: As far as I know, during the six months that you came to Mindong from Xiamen, you have been studying the lives of the people. You have a good understanding of the basic conditions of Mindong. I heard that you pay great attention to the word “rural.” Can you elaborate?"
"Reflections on the Economic Development of Mindong——Interview with Comrade Xi Jinping, Secretary of the CCP Ningde Prefectural Committee",Xi Jinping,"Mar 2, 1989","XJP: The problem of economic construction in Mindong can be said to be largely the problem of farmers. Farmers account for the vast majority of the population, which is a basic situation. Agriculture is a feature and an advantage of Mindong. Of course, the agriculture we are talking about is not a small-scale peasant economy, but a large-scale agriculture in the sense of a commodity economy. In recent years, the economic strength of Mindong has been greatly improved, and the important performance is that agricultural production has continued to develop steadily, as domestic agriculture has developed from a single structure to a diversified one."
"Reflections on the Economic Development of Mindong——Interview with Comrade Xi Jinping, Secretary of the CCP Ningde Prefectural Committee",Xi Jinping,"Mar 2, 1989","Q: I noticed your reference to “big agriculture,” which refers to your industrial thinking. Could you please talk about it specifically?"
"Reflections on the Economic Development of Mindong——Interview with Comrade Xi Jinping, Secretary of the CCP Ningde Prefectural Committee",Xi Jinping,"Mar 2, 1989","XJP: The idea of large-scale agriculture is inseparable from the use of industries to promote agriculture. First of all, without a certain industrial base, there will be no certain financial strength, and further investment in agriculture will face problems. Secondly, the rational adjustment of the internal structure of agriculture and the formation of the agricultural and ancillary product consumption market all require industry as a catalyst. Of course, Mindong’s industry should also have its own way, that is, to properly handle the relationship between resource development and industry structure, with a focus on the processing and utilization of local resources. We must appropriately develop some industries that are required by the market, have considerable local production advantages, and utilize a large number of foreign raw materials. The future of Mindong’s industry lies in the establishment of a solid foundation for the supply of raw materials, rather than “cooking without rice.”"
"Reflections on the Economic Development of Mindong——Interview with Comrade Xi Jinping, Secretary of the CCP Ningde Prefectural Committee",Xi Jinping,"Mar 2, 1989","Q: When it comes to the issue that industries in impoverished areas cannot “cook without rice,” I am reminded of the three hot topics of Mindong: the development of the Sandu’ao port, the construction of the Fuwen railway, and the construction of a central city. Would you mind sharing your thoughts on this?"
"Reflections on the Economic Development of Mindong——Interview with Comrade Xi Jinping, Secretary of the CCP Ningde Prefectural Committee",Xi Jinping,"Mar 2, 1989","XJP: I think it is a good thing to have these three topics. It shows that the people of Mindong have improved their ability to understand nature. Of course, the transformation of nature also requires the maturity of objective conditions. The development and construction of ports, railways, and the like depend on the country’s macro decisions. The formation of central cities is also the result of long-term economic development. The financial revenue and expenditures in Mindong are unbalanced, and it will be difficult for us to carry out large-scale construction for a good while. It is necessary to let the outside world realize the meaning of these three things, but our foothold cannot rest upon this. Possibility and necessity are not the same as inevitability. Decisions concerning the overall situation of the regional development strategy must fully take into account national conditions, provincial conditions, and regional conditions. Development goals that are difficult to implement in the near future should not be advanced. The important thing is to do a good job in medium and short-term work."
"Reflections on the Economic Development of Mindong——Interview with Comrade Xi Jinping, Secretary of the CCP Ningde Prefectural Committee",Xi Jinping,"Mar 2, 1989",Q: What are your thoughts on managing the economic environment?
"Reflections on the Economic Development of Mindong——Interview with Comrade Xi Jinping, Secretary of the CCP Ningde Prefectural Committee",Xi Jinping,"Mar 2, 1989","XJP: Governing the economic environment actually provided Mindong with an opportunity. The spirit of the central government (rather than the emergency brake, as some people unilaterally understand it) is conducive to the development of productive forces in areas with relatively backward economies. Compared with speed and scale, Mindong would not be able to withstand it. The spirit of the central government enables Mindong to make use of its strengths and avoid weaknesses and to take advantage of the good opportunities for governance and rectification to promote the steady and coordinated development of productivity in our region. The agriculture, energy, transportation, communication, S&T, education, people’s daily necessities, and raw material industries that the central government proposes to protect are also the weak links in Mindong and also the aspects that Mindong must strengthen. By utilizing governance, rectification, and deepening reforms, we can either eliminate heat or transfer that heat. This then promotes the optimal combination of production factors and promotes the rational adjustment of the industrial structure."
"Reflections on the Economic Development of Mindong——Interview with Comrade Xi Jinping, Secretary of the CCP Ningde Prefectural Committee",Xi Jinping,"Mar 2, 1989",Q: You come from the open area of Xiamen. What experience do you think Xiamen can learn from the opening of a poor area like Mindong?
"Reflections on the Economic Development of Mindong——Interview with Comrade Xi Jinping, Secretary of the CCP Ningde Prefectural Committee",Xi Jinping,"Mar 2, 1989","XJP: The openness of a place is subject to the improvement of soft and hard environments. The practice of opening up in many places in recent years has proved that tax breaks are not all that attractive. Foreign businessmen not only want to save money but are rather more concerned about making more money and ask for things to be done well and neatly. What can make a big difference in Mindong is the construction of a soft environment, such as simplifying procedures, reducing costs, improving work efficiency, and improving service quality, which are all very attractive aspects. Ningde and Xiapu, which are included in the open counties, should become the pilot areas for the whole region to open up. I especially feel that it is important to have an open mind. We also need to avoid the Matthew Effect of opening up. Open areas will become more open, and closed areas will become more closed. Opening up requires certain conditions, and poor areas lack those conditions."
"Reflections on the Economic Development of Mindong——Interview with Comrade Xi Jinping, Secretary of the CCP Ningde Prefectural Committee",Xi Jinping,"Mar 2, 1989","Q: Economic development requires clean politics. Clean politics is specific to one place and one department; that is, the clean governance from Party and government cadres. How do you feel about this?"
"Reflections on the Economic Development of Mindong——Interview with Comrade Xi Jinping, Secretary of the CCP Ningde Prefectural Committee",Xi Jinping,"Mar 2, 1989","XJP: Whether the Party and government organs are kept clean or not is related to the survival of the Party and the support of people’s hearts, and of course, it will affect the fate of the socialist economy. Nowadays, the masses loudly proclaim four demands, and I believe they can be used as a wake-up call. The first saying is “if it does not belong to me, I will have nothing of it, not even the smallest bit.” I feel that this is a minimum requirement for a Party member and cadre. The second saying is that “one cannot have both the fish and the bear paw.” You cannot both wish to be an official and also hope to get rich. If you wish to be a cadre, you cannot wish to become rich. If you wish to become rich, go into business and start an enterprise. The third saying is that “so long as one’s heart is pure, all things will become clear.” Corruption, bribery, and wanton bullying of the people are not permissible under the statutes of Party discipline and state law. The fourth saying is “government officials should bring benefit to the people in their jurisdiction.” The purpose of being a cadre is to give, and the “copying” doctrine is unacceptable. Officials must not seek benefits or personal gain."

Remarks by H.E. Xi Jinping at the Global Trade in Services Summit of the 2020 China International Fair for Trade in Services,Xi Jinping,"Sep 4, 2020","Over the past few months, the people of China and other countries have supported and helped each other in a tenacious fight against COVID-19 and the global challenges that have come with it. Today, with COVID-19 yet to be brought under full control at the global level, all countries face the formidable task to defeat the virus, stabilize the economy, and protect livelihoods. It is against such a backdrop that China decided to hold this important international trade event despite many difficulties in preparation. It shows China’s willingness to join hands with all of you in this trying time and work together to enable global trade in services to thrive and the world economy to recover at an early date."
Remarks by H.E. Xi Jinping at the Global Trade in Services Summit of the 2020 China International Fair for Trade in Services,Xi Jinping,"Sep 4, 2020","CIFTIS is a large exhibition and trading platform dedicated to trade in services. This comprehensive, state-level event with a global reach has already been held six times since 2012. We hope that this year’s CIFTIS, held under the theme of “Global Services, Shared Prosperity”, will present an opportunity and serve as a platform and a bridge for people from across the world to fully showcase the new progress and breakthroughs in services trade and share in the new technologies and benefits of human progress. We hope that through in-depth exchanges and closer cooperation, delegates participating in the event could contribute your wisdom and energy to deepening cooperation on trade and investment in services and invigorating economic and social development."
Remarks by H.E. Xi Jinping at the Global Trade in Services Summit of the 2020 China International Fair for Trade in Services,Xi Jinping,"Sep 4, 2020","Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends,"
Remarks by H.E. Xi Jinping at the Global Trade in Services Summit of the 2020 China International Fair for Trade in Services,Xi Jinping,"Sep 4, 2020","Our world is going through profound changes unseen in a century, and the COVID-19 pandemic is accelerating such changes. Economic globalization has run up against headwinds; protectionism and unilateralism are on the rise; the world economy is in the doldrums; and international trade and investment have slumped. Such are the unprecedented challenges and tests in the work and life of mankind."
Remarks by H.E. Xi Jinping at the Global Trade in Services Summit of the 2020 China International Fair for Trade in Services,Xi Jinping,"Sep 4, 2020","That said, let us not forget that a new round of technological and industrial revolution in recent years has spurred a boom in digital technologies, deepened the integration of industries, and allowed the service economy to flourish. During this pandemic, certain services have been widely used: telemedicine, e-learning, sharing platforms, collaboration systems, and cross-border e-commerce, to name just a few. They have played an important part in ensuring economic stability in individual countries and promoting international cooperation against COVID-19. Going forward, open cooperation in the services sector will become an increasingly important driver for development."
Remarks by H.E. Xi Jinping at the Global Trade in Services Summit of the 2020 China International Fair for Trade in Services,Xi Jinping,"Sep 4, 2020","Here, I would like to take this opportunity to share with you the following three thoughts and suggestions."
Remarks by H.E. Xi Jinping at the Global Trade in Services Summit of the 2020 China International Fair for Trade in Services,Xi Jinping,"Sep 4, 2020","First, let us work together to foster an open and inclusive environment for cooperation. A review of human history shows that the world economy thrives in openness and withers in seclusion. The services sector is unique as it is asset-light but heavy in soft factors of production. As such, it requires, more than other sectors, an open, transparent, inclusive and non-discriminatory environment for businesses to grow. It calls for the concerted efforts of all countries to reduce border and behind-the-border barriers constraining the flow of production factors and promote cross-border connectivity. China will remain steadfast in opening up wider to the world. We will continue to work on a negative list system for managing cross-border services trade. We will develop open platforms for the pilot program of innovative development of the services sector. We will further ease market access for the services sector, and will take greater initiative to increase imports of quality services. To meet the actual needs for growing trade in services, China will promote greater harmonization of rules for the services sector at the multilateral and regional levels, and work for continued improvement in global economic governance and more inclusive growth of the world economy."
Remarks by H.E. Xi Jinping at the Global Trade in Services Summit of the 2020 China International Fair for Trade in Services,Xi Jinping,"Sep 4, 2020","Second, let us work together to unleash the power of innovation in driving cooperation forward. We need to adapt to the trend towards digital-driven, Internet-based and smart growth, jointly eliminate the “digital divide”, and advance digitalization of trade in services. China will continue to build bases for featured services export and develop new business forms and models in services trade. China will work with other countries to enhance macro policy coordination, accelerate international cooperation in the digital sector, step up intellectual property protection, and facilitate the vibrant growth of the digital economy and sharing economy. Such efforts will generate renewed dynamism for the world economy."
Remarks by H.E. Xi Jinping at the Global Trade in Services Summit of the 2020 China International Fair for Trade in Services,Xi Jinping,"Sep 4, 2020","Third, let us work together to promote mutually beneficial cooperation. In this age of economic globalization, countries share economic interdependency and intertwined interests like never before. To treat each other with sincerity and pursue shared benefits holds the key to state-to-state relations in today’s world. Countries need to forge greater synergy in growing their trade in services, seek new ways and more areas of cooperation, and look for the widest possible converging interests in development so as to make the “pie” bigger and bigger. China will make full use of CIFTIS and other platforms such as the China International Import Expo to promote policy exchange and experience-sharing, and foster diverse partnerships with foreign governments, international organizations, business associations and enterprises. China supports the establishment of a global alliance for trade in services. We hope to see more fruits from our practical cooperation so that people in different countries will all benefit from a growing trade in services."

Remarks by H.E. Xi Jinping at the Global Trade in Services Summit of the 2020 China International Fair for Trade in Services,Xi Jinping,"Sep 4, 2020","To better leverage Beijing’s role in spearheading the opening-up of China’s services sector, we will support the municipality in developing a national integrated demonstration zone for greater openness in the services sector. It will enable Beijing to take bigger, bolder steps as a trailblazer and gain more experience that would be replicable and scalable. We will also support Beijing in setting up a pilot free trade zone characterizing scientific and technological innovation, opening-up of the services sector, and digital economy. It will serve as a platform of high-standard opening-up for the coordinated development of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, and open up new horizons for reform and opening-up at a higher level."

Remarks by H.E. Xi Jinping at the Global Trade in Services Summit of the 2020 China International Fair for Trade in Services,Xi Jinping,"Sep 4, 2020","The sudden attack of COVID-19 may have prevented us from meeting face to face, but it cannot block the growth of trade in services. Nor will it affect our confidence and action as we pursue shared progress and mutually beneficial cooperation. Let us pull together and strengthen our resolve to get over this difficult period for mankind. Let us move to embrace a better tomorrow for the world."
Remarks by H.E. Xi Jinping at the Global Trade in Services Summit of the 2020 China International Fair for Trade in Services,Xi Jinping,"Sep 4, 2020","To conclude, I wish CIFTIS a great success."

Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Global Trade in Services Summit of the 2021 China International Trade for Trade in Services,Xi Jinping,"Sep 2, 2021","We will open up at a higher level, by implementing across the country a negative list for cross-border services trade and by exploring the development of national demonstration zones for the innovative development of trade in services. We will create more possibilities for cooperation, by scaling up support for the growth of the services sector in Belt and Road partner countries and by sharing China’s technological achievements with the rest of the world. We will further improve rules for the services sector, by supporting Beijing and other localities in piloting the alignment of domestic rules with the ones in high-standard international free trade agreements and in building demonstration zones of digital trade. We will continue to support the innovation-driven development of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), by deepening the reform of the New Third Board (National Equities Exchange and Quotations) and setting up a Beijing Stock Exchange as the primary platform serving innovation-oriented SMEs. "

Remarks by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting to Commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations,Xi Jinping,"Sep 21, 2020","Mr. President, "
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting to Commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations,Xi Jinping,"Sep 21, 2020","Colleagues, "
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting to Commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations,Xi Jinping,"Sep 21, 2020","Seventy-five years ago, the people of the world, with strenuous struggle and tremendous sacrifice, won the great victory in the World Anti-Fascist War. It was indeed a victory for justice and a victory for the people. "
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting to Commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations,Xi Jinping,"Sep 21, 2020","Through the first half of the last century, mankind had suffered the scourge of two devastating wars that brought untold sufferings to the world. It was against such a backdrop that the United Nations (UN) came into being. Over the ensuing 75 years, this Organization has traveled an extraordinary journey. A new chapter has thus opened for peace and development in the world.  "
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting to Commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations,Xi Jinping,"Sep 21, 2020","— The 75 years since the founding of the UN has seen dramatic progress in human society. We have experienced significant and across-the-board progress in science and technology and in industrial revolution. We are now embracing a new round of even more extensive and substantial scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation. Globally, social productivity has been unprecedentedly unleashed and boosted. Mankind has never been so powerfully capable to overcome the difficulties we face and change the world we live in. "
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting to Commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations,Xi Jinping,"Sep 21, 2020",— The 75 years since the founding of the UN has witnessed profound changes in the international situation. A great many developing countries have gained national liberation and independence. Over a billion people have walked out of poverty. And a population of several billion have embarked on a path toward modernization. These achievements have considerably strengthened the force for peace and development in the world and transformed the international landscape in a most far-reaching way. 
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting to Commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations,Xi Jinping,"Sep 21, 2020","— The 75 years since the founding of the UN has been a period of rapid development of multilateralism. Problems facing the world are big and many, and global challenges are on the increase. They should and can only be resolved through dialogue and cooperation. International affairs ought to be addressed through consultation among us all. The understanding that we are all in the same boat is now a popular consensus in the global community. "
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting to Commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations,Xi Jinping,"Sep 21, 2020","After the storm comes the rainbow. The UN has stood one test after another and emerged with renewed vigor and vitality. The UN embodies the aspiration of the over seven billion people for a better life, and the UN Charter remains an important guarantee for world peace and development. "
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting to Commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations,Xi Jinping,"Sep 21, 2020","Mr. President, "
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting to Commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations,Xi Jinping,"Sep 21, 2020","Major changes unseen in a century are taking place in our world. The sudden attack of COVID-19 is a grave test for the entire world. Mankind has entered a new era of interconnectedness, with countries sharing intertwined interests and their future closely linked together. Global threats and global challenges require strong, global responses. "
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting to Commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations,Xi Jinping,"Sep 21, 2020","In the face of new realities and challenges, we must do some serious thinking: What kind of UN is needed for the world? How should the Organization play its role in the post-COVID era? Let me share some of my thoughts with you. "
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting to Commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations,Xi Jinping,"Sep 21, 2020","First, the UN must stand firm for justice. Mutual respect and equality among all countries, big or small, represents the progress of our times and is the foremost principle of the UN Charter. No country has the right to dominate global affairs, control the destiny of others, or keep advantages in development all to itself. Even less should one be allowed to do whatever it likes and be the hegemon, bully or boss of the world. Unilateralism is a dead end. All need to follow the approach of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits. All need to come together to uphold universal security, share the fruits of development, and jointly decide on the future of the world. It is imperative that the representation and voice of developing countries be increased so that the UN could be more balanced in reflecting the interests and wishes of the majority of countries in the world. "
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting to Commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations,Xi Jinping,"Sep 21, 2020","Second, the UN must uphold the rule of law. The purposes and principles of the UN Charter are the fundamental guidelines for handling international relations. They constitute a cornerstone of stable international order and must be unswervingly kept and upheld. Relations among countries and coordination of their interests must only be based on rules and institutions; they must not be lorded over by those who wave a strong fist at others. Big countries should lead by example in advocating and upholding the international rule of law and in honoring their commitments. There must be no practice of exceptionalism or double standards. Nor should international law be distorted and used as a pretext to undermine other countries’ legitimate rights and interests or world peace and stability. "
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting to Commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations,Xi Jinping,"Sep 21, 2020","Third, the UN must promote cooperation. To promote cooperation among countries is a founding mission of the UN and an important purpose spelt out in the UN Charter. Cold War mentality, ideological lines or zero-sum game are no solution to a country’s own problem, still less an answer to mankind’s common challenges. What we need to do is to replace conflict with dialogue, coercion with consultation and zero-sum with win-win. We need to pursue the common interests of all as we each work to safeguard our own interests. We need to expand the converging interests of all and build a big global family of harmony and cooperation. "
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting to Commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations,Xi Jinping,"Sep 21, 2020","Fourth, the UN must focus on real action. To put into practice the principle of multilateralism, we must act, not just talk. There must be a cure, not just a therapy. The UN should aim at problem solving and move toward tangible outcomes as it advances security, development and human rights in parallel. In particular, as the UN advances its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, priority should be given to addressing non-traditional security challenges such as public health; the issue of development should be highlighted in the global macro framework; and there should be a greater emphasis on the promotion and protection of the rights to subsistence and development. "
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting to Commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations,Xi Jinping,"Sep 21, 2020","China was the first to sign on the Charter of the United Nations. It is a founding member of the UN and the only developing country that takes a permanent seat on the Security Council. China will continue to be a true follower of multilateralism. It will stay actively engaged in reforming and developing the global governance system. It will firmly uphold the UN-centered international system, firmly uphold the international order underpinned by international law, and firmly defend the UN’s central role in international affairs. "
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting to Commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations,Xi Jinping,"Sep 21, 2020","Mr. President, "
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting to Commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations,Xi Jinping,"Sep 21, 2020","The world now stands at a new historical starting point. Let us renew our firm commitment to multilateralism, work to promote a community with a shared future for mankind, and rally behind the banner of the UN to pursue greater unity and progress. "
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting to Commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the United Nations,Xi Jinping,"Sep 21, 2020",I thank you. 
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Leaders’ Side Event on Safeguarding the Planet of the G20 Riyadh Summit,Xi Jinping,"Nov 22, 2020","Dear Colleagues, Friends,"
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Leaders’ Side Event on Safeguarding the Planet of the G20 Riyadh Summit,Xi Jinping,"Nov 22, 2020",The Earth is our shared home. We may follow the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind and pitch in to tackle climate and other environmental challenges and protect the blue planet. Let me share with you my thoughts on what G20 could do:
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Leaders’ Side Event on Safeguarding the Planet of the G20 Riyadh Summit,Xi Jinping,"Nov 22, 2020","First, we could strengthen our response to climate change. G20 should continue to take the lead in tackling climate change. We need to follow the guidance of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and push for the full and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement. Not long ago, I announced China’s initiative to scale up its nationally determined contributions and strive to peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. China will honor its commitment and see the implementation through."
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Leaders’ Side Event on Safeguarding the Planet of the G20 Riyadh Summit,Xi Jinping,"Nov 22, 2020","Second, we could deepen the transition toward clean energy. China applauds Saudi Arabia’s initiative on Circular Carbon Economy, and supports the shift to low-carbon energy in the post-COVID era to achieve the goal of Sustainable Energy for All. China has put in place the world’s biggest clean energy system, and has led the world in the output and sales of new energy vehicles for five years running. Under the recommendations for formulating China’s 14th five-year development plan and the long-range goals for 2035, China will pursue clean, low-carbon, safe and efficient use of energy and accelerate the growth of new energy and green industries to promote greener economic and social development in all respects."
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Leaders’ Side Event on Safeguarding the Planet of the G20 Riyadh Summit,Xi Jinping,"Nov 22, 2020","Third, we could protect the ecosystem with a respect for Nature. China supports deepening G20 cooperation in reducing land degradation, conserving coral reefs, and cleaning up plastic from the ocean. Through cooperation in these and many other areas, we could build a stronger defense for global ecological security. The 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity will be held in the Chinese city of Kunming in May next year. China welcomes the participation of all parties and hopes the meeting will set goals and take actions to ensure the protection of global biodiversity in the years ahead. Let us work together for a clean and beautiful world."
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Leaders’ Side Event on Safeguarding the Planet of the G20 Riyadh Summit,Xi Jinping,"Nov 22, 2020",Thank you.

Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Opening Ceremony of the 17th China-ASEAN Expo and China-ASEAN Business and Investment Summit,Xi Jinping,"Nov 27, 2020","This year’s CAEXPO, themed “Building the Belt and Road, Strengthening Digital Economy Cooperation”, aims to deepen China-ASEAN cooperation on the digital economy, promote high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, and inject new vitality into the economic and social development of both sides."
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Opening Ceremony of the 17th China-ASEAN Expo and China-ASEAN Business and Investment Summit,Xi Jinping,"Nov 27, 2020","China and ASEAN countries, connected by the same mountains and rivers, share close affinity and a longstanding friendship. In 2013, I announced an initiative for China to work with ASEAN countries for a 21st Century Maritime Silk Road and for a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future."
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Opening Ceremony of the 17th China-ASEAN Expo and China-ASEAN Business and Investment Summit,Xi Jinping,"Nov 27, 2020","We are glad to note that, seven years on, China and ASEAN enjoy growing connectivity, deepening economic integration, robust business ties, and closer people-to-people exchanges.

Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Opening Ceremony of the 17th China-ASEAN Expo and China-ASEAN Business and Investment Summit,Xi Jinping,"Nov 27, 2020","When confronted by the sudden onslaught of COVID-19 this year, China and ASEAN have helped each other and took on the challenge in solidarity. We have reached important consensus in many respects, including sharing experience on COVID-19 response, ensuring medical supplies, conducting joint research and development of vaccines, and keeping the regional industrial and supply chains stable. At a crucial stage in China’s fight against the coronavirus, ASEAN countries promptly provided invaluable support and selfless assistance to China. Once the situation began to ease on its domestic front, China sent expert teams to ASEAN countries, offered material and technical assistance, shared containment experience, and speedily opened “fast tracks” and “green lanes” to facilitate the flow of people and goods."
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Opening Ceremony of the 17th China-ASEAN Expo and China-ASEAN Business and Investment Summit,Xi Jinping,"Nov 27, 2020","Ladies and Gentlemen, Friends,"
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Opening Ceremony of the 17th China-ASEAN Expo and China-ASEAN Business and Investment Summit,Xi Jinping,"Nov 27, 2020","Our world is undergoing momentous changes unseen in a century. It is moving toward greater multi-polarity, economic globalization and cultural diversity, and is becoming increasingly information-oriented. Never before have the destinies of people in different countries been so closely connected. At the same time, however, the world is faced with growing uncertainties and instability. The world economy is sluggish; unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise; cyber security issues, major infectious diseases, climate change, and many other non-traditional security threats continue to spread; and the international order and global governance system are being challenged."
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Opening Ceremony of the 17th China-ASEAN Expo and China-ASEAN Business and Investment Summit,Xi Jinping,"Nov 27, 2020","Under the new circumstances, China continues to regard ASEAN as a priority in its neighborhood diplomacy and a key region in high-quality Belt and Road cooperation. China supports ASEAN’s community-building, supports ASEAN centrality in East Asian cooperation, and supports ASEAN in playing a bigger role in building an open and inclusive regional architecture."
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Opening Ceremony of the 17th China-ASEAN Expo and China-ASEAN Business and Investment Summit,Xi Jinping,"Nov 27, 2020","China will work with ASEAN to advance all-round cooperation under the guidance of the Strategic Partnership Vision 2030. Such efforts will help maintain the good momentum for development and prosperity in our region and cultivate a closer China-ASEAN community with a shared future. For that to happen, let me make the following suggestions on what we need to do:"
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Opening Ceremony of the 17th China-ASEAN Expo and China-ASEAN Business and Investment Summit,Xi Jinping,"Nov 27, 2020","First, we need to enhance strategic mutual trust and further synergize our development plans. China will work with ASEAN to advance our wide-ranging cooperation in the coming five years in line with the Plan of Action to Implement the Joint Declaration on China-ASEAN Strategic Partnership for Peace and Prosperity (2021-2025). China will also work with ASEAN to implement the China-ASEAN Joint Statement on Synergizing the Belt and Road Initiative and the Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity 2025. To be specific, more efforts will be made to build the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor, strengthen cooperation on infrastructure connectivity including railways, highways, ports, airports, power and communications, speed up the development of existing economic corridors and key projects, and continue to develop the China-ASEAN Multimodal Transport Alliance. Next year will mark the 30th anniversary of China-ASEAN dialogue relations. China will work with ASEAN on the planning and organization of commemorative events and take our strategic partnership to a higher level."
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Opening Ceremony of the 17th China-ASEAN Expo and China-ASEAN Business and Investment Summit,Xi Jinping,"Nov 27, 2020","Second, we need to elevate economic and trade cooperation and facilitate an early and full recovery of the regional economy. China will enhance coordination with ASEAN countries, and take the 10th anniversary of the full establishment of the China-ASEAN FTA as an opportunity to further implement our free trade agreement. China welcomes the signing of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and looks forward to its early entry into force. China will work with ASEAN countries to sustain the smooth flow of trade, promote mutual investment, open up markets wider to each other, and foster deeply integrated industrial, supply and value chains. Provided that all necessary COVID-19 containment protocols are duly observed, steps should be taken to facilitate the movement of people and goods. We also need to further deepen and substantiate Lancang-Mekong cooperation and China-BIMP-EAGA cooperation. The CAEXPO should be used fully as a platform with a bigger role to play in promoting all-round economic and trade cooperation between China and ASEAN and in the entire East Asia."
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Opening Ceremony of the 17th China-ASEAN Expo and China-ASEAN Business and Investment Summit,Xi Jinping,"Nov 27, 2020","Third, we need to enhance innovation in science and technology and deepen cooperation on the digital economy. This year is designated the China-ASEAN Year of Digital Economy Cooperation. China will work with ASEAN countries to seize the opportunities presented by the new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation. We should tap into our complementarity and pursue mutually beneficial cooperation. We could create more highlights of cooperation in such areas as smart city, 5G, artificial intelligence, e-commerce, big data, blockchain and telemedicine, and strengthen the protection of data security and policy communication and coordination, as these efforts will help nurture new drivers for the social and economic development of our two sides. China will work with ASEAN on the China-ASEAN Information Harbor to advance digital connectivity and build a digital Silk Road."
Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Opening Ceremony of the 17th China-ASEAN Expo and China-ASEAN Business and Investment Summit,Xi Jinping,"Nov 27, 2020","Fourth, we need to strengthen cooperation against COVID-19 and enhance capacity building in public health. China stands ready for policy dialogue on public health with ASEAN to improve cooperation mechanisms. It is important that we join forces in fighting the coronavirus and step up information sharing and cooperation on the production, development, and deployment of vaccines. When its COVID-19 vaccines are available for use, China will actively consider the needs of ASEAN countries. China will provide financial support to the COVID-19 ASEAN Response Fund, and work with ASEAN in developing the Regional Reserve of Medical Supplies for Public Health Emergencies and launching a Liaison Mechanism for Public Health Emergencies with ASEAN. China will act on the China-ASEAN Human Resources Training Program of Health Silk Road (2020-2022) to train for ASEAN countries 1,000 administrative and specialized personnel in the health sector, in a bid to help deliver higher quality public health services in the region. China will work with ASEAN countries and other members of the international community through greater solidarity and cooperation to support the World Health Organization in playing a leadership role and to build a global community of health for all."

Solidly Promote Common Prosperity,Xi Jinping,"Oct 15, 2021","Since the reform and opening up, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has profoundly reviewed its historical experience, both positive and negative, and realized that poverty is not socialism. It has broken the shackles of the traditional system, allowed some people and some regions to get rich first, and promoted the liberation and development of social productivity. "
Solidly Promote Common Prosperity,Xi Jinping,"Oct 15, 2021","Since the 18th National Congress of the CCP, the Party Central Committee has grasped the new changes in the development stage, placed greater importance on the gradual realization of common prosperity for all people, and promoted coordinated regional development. It has taken strong measures to safeguard and improve people’s livelihood, won the battle against poverty, and completed the building of a moderately prosperous society in all aspects, and created favorable conditions for promoting common prosperity. And now, we have reached the solid promotion of common prosperity at the stage of history. "
Solidly Promote Common Prosperity,Xi Jinping,"Oct 15, 2021","As we move toward the goal of the second century, we must adapt to the changes in the main contradictions of our society and better meet the growing needs of the people for a better life. It is imperative to promote the common prosperity for all as the focus of our effort to achieve happiness for the people and constantly consolidate the foundation of the Party’s long-term ruling. High-quality development requires high-quality workers. Only by promoting common prosperity, raising incomes of urban and rural residents, and enhancing human capital can we then raise total factor productivity and lay a solid foundation for high-quality development. At present, the problem of global income inequality is prominent. In some countries, the rich and the poor are polarized and the middle-class collapses, leading to social fracture, political polarization, and populism. The lessons are very profound. China must resolutely prevent polarization, promote common prosperity, and achieve social harmony. "
Solidly Promote Common Prosperity,Xi Jinping,"Oct 15, 2021","At the same time, it is important to recognize that the problem of unbalanced and inadequate development in China remains prominent, and there is a large disparity in development and income distribution between urban and rural areas. The new wave of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation has given a strong boost to economic growth and has a profound impact on employment and income distribution, including some negative impacts that need to be addressed effectively. "
Solidly Promote Common Prosperity,Xi Jinping,"Oct 15, 2021","Common prosperity is the essential requirement of socialism and an important feature of Chinese-style modernization. The common prosperity that we spoke of is the wealth of all people, both in material and spiritual life, rather than the prosperity of a few nor uniform egalitarianism. "
Solidly Promote Common Prosperity,Xi Jinping,"Oct 15, 2021","We should study the objectives of different stages and promote common prosperity in phase: By the end of the 14th Five-Year Plan, solid steps should have been taken to achieve common prosperity for all people, and the gap between incomes and actual consumption levels of residents should have gradually narrowed. By 2035, substantial progress toward common prosperity for all will be more evident, and basic public services will be equalized. By the middle of this century, the common prosperity of all people will be achieved, and the gap between incomes and actual consumption levels of residents will be narrowed to a reasonable range. We should promptly formulate a plan of action for promoting common prosperity and put forward scientifically feasible assessment and evaluation methods that suit China’s national indicators. "
Solidly Promote Common Prosperity,Xi Jinping,"Oct 15, 2021"," To promote common prosperity, we must grasp the following principles: "
Solidly Promote Common Prosperity,Xi Jinping,"Oct 15, 2021","Encourage making wealth from hard work and innovation. A happy life is achieved through hard work, and common prosperity is created through hard work and wisdom. We must adhere to safeguard and improve the livelihood of the people during the development, give priority to promoting high-quality development, create more inclusive and equitable conditions for people to improve their educational attainment and development capabilities, upgrade the human capital and professional skills of the whole society, and enhance employability and entrepreneurship, which in turn enhances their ability to become rich. We need to prevent social class solidification, open channels for upward mobility, create opportunities for more people to get wealthy that form a development environment in which everyone participates, and avoid getting “bogged down” (vicious competition or making meaningless efforts)and “lying flat” (young Chinese reject rat race and embrace being a couch potato). "
Solidly Promote Common Prosperity,Xi Jinping,"Oct 15, 2021","Adhere to the basic economic system. To be based on the primary stage of socialism, adhere to the “two unwaverings.” We need to ensure that the public sector plays a dominant role and that economic entities under different forms of ownership develop side by side with the public sector and play an important role in promoting common prosperity. While we need to promote the sound development of the non-public sector and the healthy growth of non-public-sector employees, we need to allow some people to get rich first while emphasizing that those who get rich first should bring along others and help others get rich. We should emphasize to encourage entrepreneurial leaders who get rich by hard-working, legitimate operations with the courage to start new businesses. Growing rich with illegitimate means should not be advocated; illegal violations should be handled per the laws and regulations. "
Solidly Promote Common Prosperity,Xi Jinping,"Oct 15, 2021","Try our utmost to do our best. It is necessary to establish a scientific public policy system and form a rational distribution pattern for all. We need to take stronger and more concrete measures to give the people a greater sense of gain. Meanwhile, we should also note that our country’s level of development is still far from the developed countries. We need to balance needs and possibilities, and safeguard and improve people’s livelihood based on economic development and financial sustainability. We should not bite off more than we can chew and make promises that we cannot keep. The government cannot cover everything, and the focus is on strengthening fundamental, inclusive, and basic living protection and efforts. Even if the level of development is higher and the financial resources are stronger in the future, we still cannot set too high goals and provide overprotection; we should resolutely prevent falling into a “welfare” trap and raising idlers. "
Solidly Promote Common Prosperity,Xi Jinping,"Oct 15, 2021","Adhere to gradual progress. Common prosperity is a long-term goal that requires going through a process that cannot be achieved overnight. It must be fully estimated for its long-term nature, difficulties, and complexities; there is no time to waste but also cannot be rushed. Some developed countries have been industrializing for centuries, but due to their social systems, the problem of common prosperity remains unresolved, and the disparity between the rich and the poor is becoming increasingly serious. We must be patient, take solid measures to handle matters one by one, and increase efficiency. We should make attention to the construction of Zhejiang Common Prosperity Demonstration Zone and encourage locals to explore effective paths in light of local conditions and experience, and push forward gradually. "
Solidly Promote Common Prosperity,Xi Jinping,"Oct 15, 2021","The general idea is to promote common prosperity in high-quality development; properly handle the relations between efficiency and fairness; establish basic institutional arrangements for initial distribution, redistribution, and coordination of the third distributions; and that the adjustment of taxation, social security, transfer payments, and other adjustments should be increased and accuracy improved, the proportion of middle-income groups expanded, and the income of low-income groups increased. Also, high income should be rationally regulated, and illegal income should be abolished, to form an olive-shaped distribution structure with a large middle section and two small ends that promote social equity and justice, comprehensive human development, as well as enables all people to make solid progress toward the goal of common prosperity. "
Solidly Promote Common Prosperity,Xi Jinping,"Oct 15, 2021","First, improve the balance, coherence, and inclusiveness of development. It is necessary to accelerate the improvement of the socialist market economy system and promote more balanced, coordinated, and inclusive development. It is essential to enhance the balance of regional development, implement major regional strategies as well as regional coordination and development strategies, improve the transfer and payment system, reduce the regional gap in per capita financial expenditure, and increase support to the less developed regions. It is necessary to strengthen the coordination of industry development; accelerate the reform of the monopoly industries; and promote the coordinated development of finance, real estate, and the real economy. We should support the development of small and medium-sized enterprises and build up an enterprise development ecology in which large and medium-sized enterprises are interdependent and mutually improving. "
Solidly Promote Common Prosperity,Xi Jinping,"Oct 15, 2021","Second, focus on increasing the size of the middle-income group. It is important to grasp the focus and make precise strategies to promote more low-income people to enter the middle-income groups. College students are an important part of the middle-income group. It is important to improve the quality of tertiary education to enable them to use the expertise they learn and support them to adapt to the social development needs soonest possible. Skilled workers are also an important part of the middle-income group. It is necessary to strengthen the training of skilled talents, raise the wages of skilled workers, and attract more qualified talents to the skilled workforce. Small and medium-sized business owners and self-employed businesses are an important group of entrepreneurs to become wealthy. We should improve the business environment, reduce the burden of taxes and fees, and provide more market-oriented financial services to help them to have stabilized operations and continuous increase of income. Migrant workers that come to the cities are an important source of middle-income groups. We should deepen the reform of the household registration system and solve problems such as children’s education for the workers migrating from rural for their peace of mind in finding jobs in the cities. Wages of civil servants, especially grassroots frontline civil servants and grassroots workers in state-owned enterprises and public enterprises, should be properly raised. It is necessary to increase the income of urban and rural residents from housing, rural lands, and financial assets. "
Solidly Promote Common Prosperity,Xi Jinping,"Oct 15, 2021","Third, promote the equalization of basic public services. Low-income groups are the key support groups on promoting common prosperity. It is necessary to increase investment in inclusive human capital, effectively alleviate the burden of education for families with difficulties, and raise the education level of low-income children. It is necessary to improve the pension and medical security system, gradually reduce the gap between workers and residents and urban and rural areas in terms of financing and security, and gradually raise the level of basic pensions for urban and rural residents. We should improve the basic comprehensive support system, accelerate the narrowing of the gap of urban and rural areas social assistance standards, and gradually raise the minimum living security level of urban and rural areas, and support basic living standards. We need to improve the housing supply and protection system, insist on the position that housing is for living and not for speculation, for rent and purchase. We need to improve the long-term rental housing policy based on urban policies, expand the supply of affordable rental housing, and focus on solving the housing problem of new citizens. "
Solidly Promote Common Prosperity,Xi Jinping,"Oct 15, 2021","Fourth, strengthen regulation and adjustment on high incomes. While protecting legitimate income per the law, it is necessary to prevent polarization and eliminate unjust distribution. It is necessary to regulate excessive income rationally, improve the personal income tax system, and standardize the management of capital income. We need to push forward real estate tax legislation and reform actively and steadily and conduct good pilot work. We need to intensify consumption-related tax regulation and study the scope of consumption tax collection. We should strengthen the regulation and management of philanthropy, improve tax incentives, and encourage high-income groups and enterprises to give back more to society. We must clean up and standardize unreasonable income, increase the management of income distribution in monopoly industries and state-owned enterprises, rectify income distribution order, and clean up distribution chaos, such as those that increase the income of executives in the name of reform. It is necessary to resolutely curb trade power, firmly crackdown on insider trading, stock market manipulation, financial counterfeiting, tax evasion, etc. "
Solidly Promote Common Prosperity,Xi Jinping,"Oct 15, 2021","After years of exploration, we have a complete approach to the poverty problem; however, we still need to explore and accumulate experience on how to get wealthy. We need to protect property rights and intellectual property rights and protect from getting wealthy illegitimately. We must resolutely oppose the disorderly expansion of capital, draw up negative lists for access to sensitive areas, and strengthen anti-monopoly supervision. At the same time, it is also necessary to mobilize entrepreneurial motivation to promote the healthy development of all kinds of capital norms. "
Solidly Promote Common Prosperity,Xi Jinping,"Oct 15, 2021","Fifth, promote the common prosperity of the people’s spiritual life. There is a high degree of unity between the promotion of common prosperity and the promotion of the all-rounded development of people. It is necessary to strengthen the leadership of socialist core values; strengthen the education of patriotism, collectivism, and socialism; develop public cultural programs; improve the system of public cultural services; and continuously meet the diverse, multi-level, and multifaceted spiritual and cultural needs of the masses of the people. We should strengthen the guidance of public opinion on promoting common prosperity, clarify ambiguities, avoid over-eagerness of success and fear of difficulties, and provide a good environment for public opinion to promote common prosperity. "
Solidly Promote Common Prosperity,Xi Jinping,"Oct 15, 2021","Sixth, promote common prosperity for rural areas and peasants. The most difficult and onerous task of promoting common prosperity remains in the rural areas. We should speed up the work on common prosperity in rural areas, but it is not appropriate to propose uniform quantitative targets like poverty alleviation. We need to reinforce and develop the achievements of poverty alleviation, strength monitoring, and early intervention on the populations that are prone to return to poverty and cause poverty to ensure there is no sizeable return to poverty and new poverty. It is necessary to comprehensively promote rural revitalization, accelerate agricultural industrialization, revitalize rural assets, and increase farmers’ asset revenues for more rural residents to become prosperous through hard work. We should strengthen the construction of rural infrastructure and public service systems and improve the rural habitat environment. "
Solidly Promote Common Prosperity,Xi Jinping,"Oct 15, 2021","I generally believe that the common prosperity of all is an overall concept, just like the construction of a moderately prosperous society. It is for the society as a whole and should not be divided into cities and rural areas or eastern, central, and western regions, where they have their indicators. This needs to be viewed from an overall perspective. If we want to achieve common prosperity for 1.4 billion people, we must be down to earth and make a long-term effort. Not everyone is going to get affluent at the same time, and it is not for all regions to reach a single level of affluence at the same time. Different people not only have various levels of affluence, but also different levels of affluence within different regions. It is impossible to go hand in hand at the same time. This is a dynamic process of moving forward; it is necessary to continue moving forward to constantly achieve results. "

Speech at a Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2021","The Chinese nation is a great nation. With a history of more than 5,000 years, China has made indelible contributions to the progress of human civilization. After the Opium War of 1840, however, China was gradually reduced to a semi-colonial, semi-feudal society and suffered greater ravages than ever before. The country endured intense humiliation, the people were subjected to great pain, and the Chinese civilization was plunged into darkness. Since that time, national rejuvenation has been the greatest dream of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation."
Speech at a Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2021","To save the nation from peril, the Chinese people put up a courageous fight. As noble-minded patriots sought to pull the nation together, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement, the Reform Movement of 1898, the Yihetuan Movement, and the Revolution of 1911 rose one after the other, and a variety of plans were devised to ensure national survival, but all of these ended in failure. China was in urgent need of new ideas to lead the movement to save the nation and a new organization to rally revolutionary forces."
Speech at a Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2021","With the salvoes of Russia’s October Revolution in 1917, Marxism-Leninism was brought to China. Then in 1921, as the Chinese people and the Chinese nation were undergoing a great awakening and Marxism-Leninism was becoming closely integrated with the Chinese workers’ movement, the Communist Party of China was born. The founding of a communist party in China was an epoch-making event, which profoundly changed the course of Chinese history in modern times, transformed the future of the Chinese people and nation, and altered the landscape of world development."
Speech at a Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2021","Since the very day of its founding, the Party has made seeking happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation its aspiration and mission. All the struggle, sacrifice, and creation through which the Party has united and led the Chinese people over the past hundred years has been tied together by one ultimate theme—bringing about the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation."
Speech at a Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2021","To realize national rejuvenation, the Party united and led the Chinese people in fighting bloody battles with unyielding determination, achieving great success in the new-democratic revolution. Through the Northern Expedition, the Agrarian Revolutionary War, the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression, and the War of Liberation, we fought armed counter-revolution with armed revolution, toppling the three mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism and establishing the People’s Republic of China, which made the people masters of the country. We thus secured our nation’s independence and liberated our people.  The victory of the new-democratic revolution put an end to China’s history as a semi-colonial, semi-feudal society, to the state of total disunity that existed in old China, and to all the unequal treaties imposed on our country by foreign powers and all the privileges that imperialist powers enjoyed in China. It created the fundamental social conditions for realizing national rejuvenation. Through tenacious struggle, the Party and the Chinese people showed the world that the Chinese people had stood up, and that the time in which the Chinese nation could be bullied and abused by others was gone forever."
Speech at a Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2021","To realize national rejuvenation, the Party united and led the Chinese people in endeavoring to build a stronger China with a spirit of self-reliance, achieving great success in socialist revolution and construction. By carrying out socialist revolution, we eliminated the exploitative and repressive feudal system that had persisted in China for thousands of years, and established socialism as our basic system. In the process of socialist construction, we overcame subversion, sabotage, and armed provocation by imperialist and hegemonic powers, and brought about the most extensive and profound social changes in the history of the Chinese nation. This great transformation of China from a poor and backward country in the East with a large population into a socialist country laid down the fundamental political conditions and the institutional foundations necessary for realizing national rejuvenation. Through tenacious struggle, the Party and the Chinese people showed the world that the Chinese people were capable of not only dismantling the old world, but also building a new one, that only socialism could save China, and that only socialism could develop China."
Speech at a Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2021","To realize national rejuvenation, the Party united and led the Chinese people in freeing the mind and forging ahead, achieving great success in reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. We established the Party’s basic line for the primary stage of socialism, resolutely advanced reform and opening up, overcame risks and challenges from every direction, and founded, upheld, safeguarded, and developed socialism with Chinese characteristics, thus bringing about a major turn with far-reaching significance in the history of the Party since the founding of the People’s Republic of China. This enabled China to transform itself from a highly centralized planned economy to a socialist market economy brimming with vitality, and from a country that was largely isolated to one that is open to the outside world across the board. It also enabled China to achieve the historic leap from a country with relatively backward productive forces to the world’s second largest economy, and to make the historic transformation of raising the living standards of its people from bare subsistence to an overall level of moderate prosperity, and then ultimately to moderate prosperity in all respects. These achievements fueled the push toward national rejuvenation by providing institutional guarantees imbued with new energy as well as the material conditions for rapid development. Through tenacious struggle, the Party and the Chinese people showed the world that by pursuing reform and opening up, a crucial move in making China what it is today, China had caught up with the times in great strides."
Speech at a Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2021","To realize national rejuvenation, the Party has united and led the Chinese people in pursuing a great struggle, a great project, a great cause, and a great dream through a spirit of self-confidence, self-reliance, and innovation, achieving great success for socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. Following the Party’s 18th National Congress, socialism with Chinese characteristics entered a new era. In this new era, we have upheld and strengthened the Party’s overall leadership, ensured coordinated implementation of the five-sphere integrated plan and the four-pronged comprehensive strategy, upheld and improved the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics, modernized China’s system and capacity for governance, remained committed to exercising rule-based governance over the Party, and developed a sound system of intraparty regulations. We have overcome a long list of major risks and challenges, fulfilled the first centenary goal, and set out strategic steps for achieving the second centenary goal. All the historic achievements and changes in the cause of the Party and the country have provided the cause of national rejuvenation with more robust institutions, stronger material foundations, and a source of inspiration for taking greater initiative. Through tenacious struggle, the Party and the Chinese people have shown the world that the Chinese nation has achieved the tremendous transformation from standing up and growing prosperous to becoming strong, and that China’s national rejuvenation has become a historical inevitability."

Speech at a Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2021","The people are the true heroes, for it is they who create history. On behalf of the CCP Central Committee, I would like to pay my highest respects to workers, farmers, and intellectuals across the country; to other political parties, public figures without party affiliation, people’s organizations, and patriotic figures from all sectors of society; to all members of the People’s Liberation Army, the People’s Armed Police Force, the public security police, and the fire and rescue services; to all socialist working people; and to all members of the united front. I would like to extend my sincere greetings to compatriots in the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions and in Taiwan as well as overseas Chinese.

Speech at a Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2021","Though our Party’s founding mission is easy to define, ensuring that we stay true to this mission is a more difficult task. By learning from history, we can understand why powers rise and fall. Through the mirror of history, we can find where we currently stand and gain foresight into the future. Looking back on the Party’s 100-year history, we can see why we were successful in the past and how we can continue to succeed in the future. This will ensure that we act with greater resolve and purpose in staying true to our founding mission and pursuing a better future on the new journey that lies before us.  As we put conscious effort into learning from history to create a bright future, we must bear the following in mind:"
Speech at a Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2021","We must uphold the firm leadership of the Party. China’s success hinges on the Party. The more than 180-year-long modern history of the Chinese nation, the 100-year-long history of the Party, and the more than 70-year-long history of the People’s Republic of China all provide ample evidence that without the Communist Party of China, there would be no new China and no national rejuvenation. The Party was chosen by history and the people. The leadership of the Party is the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics and constitutes the greatest strength of this system. It is the foundation and lifeblood of the Party and the country, and the crux upon which the interests and wellbeing of all Chinese people depend."
Speech at a Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2021","On the journey ahead, we must uphold the Party’s overall leadership and continue to enhance its leadership. We must be deeply conscious of the need to maintain political integrity, think in big-picture terms, follow the leadership core, and keep in alignment with the central Party leadership. We must stay confident in the path, theory, system, and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics. We must uphold the core position of the General Secretary on the Party Central Committee and in the Party as a whole, and uphold the Central Committee’s authority and its centralized, unified leadership. Bearing in mind the country’s most fundamental interests, we must enhance the Party’s capacity to conduct sound, democratic, and law-based governance, and ensure that it fully exerts its core role in providing overall leadership and coordinating the efforts of all sides."
Speech at a Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2021","We must unite and lead the Chinese people in working ceaselessly for a better life. This country is its people; the people are the country. As we have fought to establish and consolidate our leadership over the country, we have in fact been fighting to earn and keep the people’s support. The Party has in the people its roots, its lifeblood, and its source of strength. The Party has always represented the fundamental interests of all Chinese people; it stands with them through thick and thin and shares a common fate with them. The Party has no special interests of its own—it has never represented any individual interest group, power group, or privileged stratum. Any attempt to divide the Party from the Chinese people or to set the people against the Party is bound to fail. The more than 95 million Party members and the more than 1.4 billion Chinese people will never allow such a scenario to come to pass."
Speech at a Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2021","On the journey ahead, we must rely closely on the people to create history. Upholding the Party’s fundamental purpose of wholeheartedly serving the people, we will stand firmly with the people, implement the Party’s mass line, respect the people’s creativity, and practice a people-centered philosophy of development. We will develop whole-process people’s democracy, safeguard social fairness and justice, and resolve the imbalances and inadequacies in development and the most pressing difficulties and problems that are of great concern to the people. In doing so, we will make more notable and substantive progress toward achieving well-rounded human development and common prosperity for all."
Speech at a Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2021","We must continue to adapt Marxism to the Chinese context. Marxism is the fundamental guiding ideology upon which our Party and country are founded; it is the very soul of our Party and the banner under which it strives. The Communist Party of China upholds the basic tenets of Marxism and the principle of seeking truth from facts. Based on China’s realities, we have developed keen insights into the trends of the day, seized the initiative in history, and made painstaking explorations. We have thus been able to keep adapting Marxism to the Chinese context and the needs of our times, and to guide the Chinese people in advancing our great social revolution. At the fundamental level, the capability of our Party and the strengths of socialism with Chinese characteristics are attributable to the fact that Marxism works."
Speech at a Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2021","On the journey ahead, we must continue to uphold Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Theory of Three Represents, and the Scientific Outlook on Development, and fully implement the Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. We must continue to adapt the basic tenets of Marxism to China’s specific realities and its fine traditional culture. We will use Marxism to observe, understand, and steer the trends of our times, and continue to develop the Marxism of contemporary China and in the 21st century."
Speech at a Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2021","We must uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics. We must follow our own path—this is the bedrock that underpins all the theories and practices of our Party. More than that, it is the historical conclusion our Party has drawn from its struggles over the past century. Socialism with Chinese characteristics is a fundamental achievement of the Party and the people, forged through innumerable hardships and great sacrifices, and it is the right path for us to achieve national rejuvenation. As we have upheld and developed socialism with Chinese characteristics and driven coordinated progress in material, political, cultural-ethical, social, and ecological terms, we have pioneered a new and uniquely Chinese path to modernization, and created a new model for human advancement."
Speech at a Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2021","On the journey ahead, we must adhere to the Party’s basic theory, line, and policy, and implement the five-sphere integrated plan and the four-pronged comprehensive strategy. We must deepen reform and opening up across the board, ground our work in this new stage of development, fully and faithfully apply the new development philosophy, and foster a new pattern of development. We must promote high-quality development and build up our country’s strength in science and technology. We must ensure it is our people who run the country, continue to govern based on the rule of law, and uphold the core socialist values. We must ensure and enhance public wellbeing in the course of development, promote harmony between humanity and nature, and take well-coordinated steps toward making our people prosperous, our nation strong, and our country beautiful."
Speech at a Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2021","The Chinese nation has fostered a splendid civilization over more than 5,000 years of history. The Party has also acquired a wealth of experience through its endeavors over the past 100 years and during more than 70 years of governance. At the same time, we are also eager to learn what lessons we can from the achievements of other cultures, and welcome helpful suggestions and constructive criticism. We will not, however, accept sanctimonious preaching from those who feel they have the right to lecture us. The Party and the Chinese people will keep moving confidently forward in broad strides along the path that we have chosen for ourselves, and we will make sure the destiny of China’s development and progress remains firmly in our own hands."
Speech at a Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2021","We must accelerate the modernization of national defense and the armed forces. A strong country must have a strong military, as only then can it guarantee the security of the nation. At the point that it was engaged in violent struggle, the Party came to recognize the irrefutable truth that it must command the gun and build a people’s military of its own. The people’s military has made indelible achievements on behalf of the Party and the people. It is a strong pillar for safeguarding our socialist country and preserving national dignity, and a powerful force for protecting peace in our region and beyond."
Speech at a Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2021","On the journey ahead, we must fully implement the Party’s thinking on strengthening the military in the new era as well as our military strategy for the new era, maintain the Party’s absolute leadership over the people’s armed forces, and follow a Chinese path to military development. We will take comprehensive measures to enhance the political loyalty of the armed forces, to strengthen them through reform and technology and the training of competent personnel, and to run them in accordance with the law. We will elevate our people’s armed forces to world-class standards so that we are equipped with greater capacity and more reliable means for safeguarding our national sovereignty, security, and development interests."
Speech at a Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2021","We must continue working to promote the building of a human community with a shared future. Peace, concord, and harmony are ideas the Chinese nation has pursued and carried forward for more than 5,000 years. The Chinese nation does not carry aggressive or hegemonic traits in its genes. The Party cares about the future of humanity, and wishes to move forward in tandem with all progressive forces around the world. China has always worked to safeguard world peace, contribute to global development, and preserve international order."
Speech at a Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2021","On the journey ahead, we will remain committed to promoting peace, development, cooperation, and mutual benefit, to an independent foreign policy of peace, and to the path of peaceful development. We will work to build a new type of international relations and a human community with a shared future, promote high-quality development of the Belt and Road Initiative through joint efforts, and use China’s new achievements in development to provide the world with new opportunities. The Party will continue to work with all peace-loving countries and peoples to promote the shared human values of peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy, and freedom. We will continue to champion cooperation over confrontation, to open up rather than closing our doors, and to focus on mutual benefits instead of zero-sum games. We will oppose hegemony and power politics, and strive to keep the wheels of history rolling toward bright horizons."
Speech at a Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2021","We Chinese are a people who uphold justice and are not intimidated by threats of force. As a nation, we have a strong sense of pride and confidence. We have never bullied, oppressed, or subjugated the people of any other country, and we never will. By the same token, we will never allow any foreign force to bully, oppress, or subjugate us. Anyone who would attempt to do so will find themselves on a collision course with a great wall of steel forged by over 1.4 billion Chinese people."
Speech at a Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2021","We must carry out a great struggle with many contemporary features. Having the courage to fight and the fortitude to win is what has made our Party invincible. Realizing our great dream will require hard work and persistence. Today, we are closer, more confident, and more capable than ever before of making the goal of national rejuvenation a reality. But we must be prepared to work harder than ever to get there."
Speech at a Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2021","On the journey ahead, we must demonstrate stronger vigilance and always be prepared for potential danger, even in times of calm. We must adopt a holistic approach to national security that balances development and security imperatives, and implement the national rejuvenation strategy within a wider context of the once-in-a-century changes taking place in the world. We need to acquire a full understanding of the new features and requirements arising from the change to the principal contradiction in Chinese society and the new issues and challenges stemming from a complicated international environment. We must be both brave and adept in carrying out our struggle, forging new paths and building new bridges wherever necessary to take us past all risks and challenges."
Speech at a Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2021","We must strengthen the great unity of the Chinese people. In the course of our struggles over the past century, the Party has always placed the united front in a position of importance. We have constantly consolidated and developed the broadest possible united front, united all the forces that can be united, mobilized all positive factors that can be mobilized, and pooled as much strength as possible for collective endeavors. The patriotic united front is an important means for the Party to unite all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, both at home and abroad, behind the goal of national rejuvenation."
Speech at a Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2021","On the journey ahead, we must ensure great unity and solidarity and balance commonality and diversity. We should strengthen theoretical and political guidance, build broad consensus, bring together the brightest minds, and expand common ground and the convergence of interests, so that all Chinese people, both at home and overseas, can focus their ingenuity and energy on the same goal and come together as a mighty force for realizing national rejuvenation."
Speech at a Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2021","We must continue to advance the great new project of Party building. A hallmark that distinguishes the Communist Party of China from other political parties is its courage in undertaking self-reform. An important reason why the Party remains so vital and vibrant despite having undergone so many trials and tribulations is that it practices effective self-supervision and full and rigorous self-governance. It has thus been able to respond appropriately to the risks and tests of different historical periods, to ensure that it always remains at the forefront of the times even as profound changes sweep the global landscape, and to stand firm as the backbone of the nation throughout the process of meeting various risks and challenges at home and abroad."
Speech at a Ceremony Marking the Centenary of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2021","On the journey ahead, we must keep firmly in mind the old adage that it takes a good blacksmith to make good steel. We must demonstrate greater political awareness of the fact that full and rigorous self-governance is a never-ending journey. With strengthening the Party politically as our overarching principle, we must continue advancing the great new project of Party building in the new era. We must tighten the Party’s organizational system, work hard to train high-caliber officials who have both moral integrity and professional competence, remain committed to improving Party conduct, upholding integrity, and combating corruption, and root out any elements that would harm the Party’s advanced nature and purity and any viruses that would erode its health. We must ensure that the Party preserves its essence, color, and character, and see that it always serves as the strong leadership core in the course of upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era."

We will ensure that the central government exercises overall jurisdiction over Hong Kong and Macao, and implement the legal systems and enforcement mechanisms for the two special administrative regions to safeguard national security.

A century ago, a group of young progressives held aloft the torch of Marxism and searched assiduously in those dark years for ways to rejuvenate the Chinese nation. Since then, under the banner of the Communist Party of China, generation after generation of young Chinese have devoted their youth to the cause of the Party and the people, and remained in the vanguard of the drive to rejuvenate the nation. In the new era, our young people should make it their mission to contribute to national rejuvenation and aspire to become more proud, confident, and assured in their identity as Chinese people so that they can live up to the promise of their youth and the expectations of our times, our Party, and our people."

Following the advent of modern times, however, owing to the aggression of the Western powers and the corruptness of China’s feudal rulers, China was gradually reduced to a semi-colonial, semi-feudal society. As the land of China was laid to waste and the people descended into misery, the Chinese nation experienced suffering of unprecedented proportions. "

This contribution was significant because it put an end to the semi-colonial, semi-feudal society of the old China; put an end to the state of total disunity that existed in Chinese society at the time; and put an end to the unequal treaties that were imposed on our country by foreign powers and to all privileges that imperialist countries enjoyed in China, thus bringing about a leap forward whereby China transformed itself from a millennia-old feudal autocracy to a people’s democracy. "

Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016"," As the saying goes, “The mirror reflects ourselves and the past sheds lights on the present.” In looking back at our history, our aim is not to take comfort from our past successes, nor are we seeking an excuse to rest on our laurels and evade the difficulties and problems we face today. Rather, our intention is to muster greater courage and strength to forge ahead by reflecting on our past experiences and grasping the underlying patterns of history. "
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016"," In 2012, the report to the 18th National Congress of the CCP stated that developing socialism with Chinese characteristics is a long-term, arduous task of historic importance, and that we must be prepared to carry out a great struggle with many new historical features. This comes as a reminder for the entire Party. It tells us that we must be ready at all times to respond to great challenges, withstand great risks, overcome great obstacles, and address great challenges; and it tells us that we must uphold and develop Chinese socialism, and uphold and consolidate the CCP’s position of leadership and governance, thereby ensuring that our party, our country, and our people always stand undefeatable. "
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016"," History moves ever onward, never stopping to wait for the hesitant, the undecided, the idle, and the weak.

Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016"," Ninety-five years have gone by in the history of the CCP, but we must forever preserve the fighting spirit that Chinese Communists demonstrated when the CCP was first founded, and forever preserve our devotion to our people. As everything moves forward, we must remember the path we have trodden; no matter how far we go and how glorious our future may be, we can never forget the past, and we can never forget why we embarked on this journey in the first place. As we confront the future and face challenges, our Party must stay true to its cause and continue marching forward. "
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016","– To stay true to why we started out and continue going forward, we must uphold the guiding role of Marxism; continue to closely integrate the basic principles of Marxism with China’s realities and contemporary features; promote innovation in both theory and practice; and constantly advance the adaptation of Marxism to suit China. "
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016","Guiding principles represent the spirit of a political party. Over the past 95 years, the reason why the CCP has managed to complete an arduous mission that no other political force in modern China was able to complete is that it has always taken Marxism as its guide to action, and remained committed to enriching and developing this scientific theory in practice. This has enabled the CCP to transcend the limitations of all other political forces that came before it, which always sought to advance their own special interests. Drawing from the scientific spirit of materialist dialectics, and from its selfless and fearless embrace, the CCP has led and advanced China’s revolution, construction, and reform, constantly upholding truths and righting wrongs. In times good and bad, the CCP has never let its belief in Marxism waver. "
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016","Marxism, and its development in China, has guided the causes of our Party and people with scientific theories that not only run in continuity but are also able to evolve as the times require. This has provided a solid theoretical foundation for enhancing the unity of the entire Party and all people of China. "
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016","Marxism is the fundamental guiding thought upon which our Party and country are founded. Were we to depart from or abandon Marxism, our Party would lose its sole and its direction. Therefore, on the fundamental issue of upholding the guiding role of Marxism, we must maintain unswerving resolve, never wavering at any time or under any circumstances."
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016","At the same time, as it is confronted with new trends and requirements in practice, Marxism also needs to be further adapted to China, further attuned to contemporary needs, and further popularized. Marxism does not exhaust truth, but rather paves a path towards it. As Engels said long ago, “Marx’s whole manner of conceiving things is not a doctrine, but a method. It offers no finished dogmas, but rather points of reference for further research, and the method of that research.” "
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016","Ideas are born from the times in which we live, and theories originate from practice. Just as there is no end to development in practice, there can be no end to our efforts to understand truth and carry out theoretical innovation. Today, times have changed, and the breadth and depth of our country’s development have far surpassed what the authors of the Marxist classics imagined when they wrote their works. At the same time, China has mere decades of experience with socialism, which remains in the primary stage of its development. The further our cause advances, and the more new circumstances and problems we encounter, the more we will be required to carry out brave explorations in practice and seek constant breakthroughs in theory. "
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016","Few people will be convinced by half-done theories. Adopting a broader perspective, we must examine the practical foundations and needs of Marxism’s contemporary development. By upholding a problem-oriented approach, centering on the initiatives that we are currently advancing, and responding to the call of the times in which we are living, we need to advance in greater depth the concrete and actual integration of Marxism with China’s contemporary development, open up new prospects for the development of Marxism in the 21st century, and enable contemporary Chinese Marxism to shine even more brightly with the light of truth."
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016","– To stay true to why we started out and continue going forward, we must remember that our Party established communism and socialism as its program at the time of its founding; remain committed to the great ideal of communism and the common ideal of Chinese socialism; and constantly advance a great effort for our ideals. "
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016",Revolutionary ideals rise above all else. The Chinese Communist Party is known as a communist party because it established communism as its ideal on the day it was founded. The reason why our Party has been able to rise up and carry on our pursuit despite setback after setback is ultimately because we have great ideals and aspirations.  
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016","Nothing in this world can be achieved without firm ideals. The wavering of an ideal or belief is the most dangerous form of wavering; the collapse of an ideal or belief is the most dangerous form of collapse. The decline of a political party often begins with the loss or absence of ideals and beliefs. The continued strength of the CCP depends not only on whether or not our Party as a whole can maintain an unwavering commitment to its ideals and beliefs, but more importantly on whether each and every Party member can maintain an unswerving commitment to these ideals and beliefs. Over the past 95 years, the communist ideal has inspired generation after generation of communists to fight courageously. Thousands upon thousands of martyrs have laid down their precious lives for this ideal. “Beheading is nothing to me, a true communist who’d be.” “The enemy can hack off our heads, but they can never shake our beliefs.” These fearless, righteous vows vividly express the uncompromising belief of communists in their ideal. Our ideals can never be extinguished, nor can our beliefs. We must always remember the unfulfilled wishes of those martyrs, and we must never forget the ideals for which they spilled their blood. "
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016"," Ideals are known as ideals because of their farsightedness; beliefs are known as beliefs because of their steadfastness. It is important that we see the teaching of ideals and beliefs as a strategic task in our effort to strengthen the CCP theoretically. To ensure that the entire CCP remains politically committed to pursuing our ideals, we must consciously act as staunch believers in and loyal practitioners of both the great communist ideal and the common ideal of Chinese socialism, and play an exemplary role in the drive to build a moderately prosperous society in all respects and realize the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation. "
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016","Political resolve depends on a clear understanding of theory. Our firm ideals and beliefs must be founded on a profound understanding of Marxism, and on a profound grasp of the underlying laws of history. The entire Party must thoroughly study Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Three Represents, and the Scientific Outlook on Development. It must also study in depth the new ideas, thoughts, and strategies in national governance introduced by the CCP Central Committee since the 18th National Congress of the CCP, in order to raise its awareness and understanding of Marxist theories and maintain its clear perception and dedicated pursuit of our great ideals and goals. We must teach Party members and officials to transform the knowledge they acquire into a source of inner strength, with which they can strengthen their awareness of Party norms and guidelines, enhance their theoretical attainment, and raise their moral standards. By genuinely studying, understanding, believing, and applying, we should strive to remain modest and prudent in the face of victory and good fortune, and avoid disillusionment and wavering in the face of difficulty and adversity, promoting social progress and realizing the fine aspirations of humanity with firm command of the moral high ground. "

Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016"," Our direction determines our path, and our path determines our future. Socialism with Chinese characteristics did not just fall from the sky. Rather, it is the fundamental achievement that the CCP and people have made at the cost of countless hardships and enormous sacrifices. Chinese socialism is not only a great cause that we must continually advance; it is a fundamental guarantee for our future. "
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016","The entire Party must have firm confidence in the path, theories, system, and culture of Chinese socialism. Of all the political parties, countries, and peoples in the world today, none have as much cause to be confident as the CCP, the People’s Republic of China, and the Chinese people. With the spirit that “self-confidence can empower a man to swim 3,000 miles and live for 200 years,” as a poem reads, we can fearlessly confront any challenge or difficulty that lies ahead, and resolutely open up new horizons and create new miracles. "
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016","We must firmly believe that the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the only path that can lead us to socialist modernization, and the only path that can create better lives for the people. We must firmly believe that the theories of Chinese socialism are not only correct theories that will lead the CCP and people to national rejuvenation along the path of socialism, but also scientific, evolving theories that are founded on the forefront of the times. And we must firmly believe that the system of Chinese socialism is a fundamental institutional guarantee for progress and development in China today, and an advanced system with distinct Chinese characteristics, notable institutional strengths, and a strong capacity for self-improvement. "
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016","Cultural confidence is a more fundamental, broader, and deeper form of self-confidence. China’s fine traditional culture, which was born out of more than 5,000 years of civilization, and its revolutionary and advanced socialist culture, which was born out of the great struggles of the CCP and the people, house the deepest aspirations of the Chinese people, representing a unique symbol of our nation. We must promote our core socialist values, promote a national spirit that is based on patriotism and a contemporary spirit that is based on reform and innovation, and enhance the inner strength of the entire Party and all people of China. "
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016","The whole Party must remember, what we are building is socialism with Chinese characteristics, not some other -ism. History has not ended, nor can it possibly end. To judge socialism with Chinese characteristics we must look to fact, and to the judgment of the Chinese people, and not to the subjective and groundless conclusions of biased people. The CCP and Chinese people have every confidence in their ability to provide a Chinese solution to aid the exploration of a better social system for humanity. "
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016","Deng Xiaoping once said: “We should adhere to the basic line for a hundred years, with no vacillation.

Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016","Building a moderately prosperous society in all respects represents a solemn promise that our Party has made to our people and to history. It is the common wish of more than 1.3 billion Chinese people. In order to realize this goal, since its 18th National Congress in 2012, the CCP has formed and actively promoted a “Five-Pronged Overall Plan” that consists of economic, political, cultural, social, and ecological development; and formed and actively promoted a comprehensive strategy that consists of comprehensively building a moderately prosperous society, comprehensively deepening reform, comprehensively advancing the rule of law, and comprehensively governing the Party with strict discipline. Mutually reinforcing and interconnected, the “Five-Pronged Overall Plan” and “Four Comprehensives” need to be implemented on a coordinated basis. On the basis of promoting economic development, we must develop a socialist market economy, democracy, advanced culture, environmental culture, and harmonious society, and advance a coordinated effort to make our people prosperous, our nation strong, and our country beautiful. "

China’s basic national condition – that it is still in the primary stage of socialism and will continue to be so for a considerable period of time to come – has not changed. The principal contradiction in Chinese society – that the ever-growing material and cultural needs of the people are unable to be met by China’s underdeveloped social production – has not changed. And China’s international status as the world’s largest developing country has not changed. This is the basic foundation on which we are seeking to develop. "

Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016","Reform must stay on the right course, neither going back down the rigid, closed-door path of the past, nor embarking on the erroneous path of changing our political direction. The overall goal of reform should be to improve and develop the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and to modernize our national governance system and governance capacity.

With a commitment to upholding China’s unique approach to socialist rule of law, we must work faster to develop a Chinese system of socialist rule of law and establish China as a socialist country under the rule of law. The core of comprehensive rule of law lies in an organic balance between the leadership of the CCP, the position of the people as masters of the country, and the rule of law, while the key to achieving it is to ensure that the CCP leads legislation, guarantees law enforcement, supports the administration of justice, and leads the way in observing the law. We must firmly establish the authority of the Constitution and law throughout our entire society, and endorse the fundamentals of the Constitution. All organizations and individuals must act within the scope permitted by the Constitution and law, and no one is permitted to have special privileges that go beyond these boundaries. "

China’s opening drive is not a solo act. Rather, it is an invitation open to all. It is a pursuit not to establish China’s own sphere of influence, but to support cooperative development of all countries. It is meant to build not China’s own backyard, but a garden shared by all countries. "
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016","China advocates a community of shared future for humankind, and is opposed to the Cold War mentality and zero-sum game. China upholds that all countries are equal, irrespective of size, strength, and wealth. It respects the right of all countries to choose their own path of development, upholds international equity and justice, and opposes the act of imposing one’s will on others, interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, and using one’s strength to bully the weak. China does not covet the rights and interests of other countries, nor does it envy their development, but it will never give up its own legitimate rights and interests. We Chinese people do not believe in fallacies, but we are not afraid of them; we do not make trouble, but we are not afraid of it. No country should entertain the fantasy that China will barter away its core national interests or allow its sovereignty, security, and development interests to be infringed upon. "
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016","On the basis of independence and autonomy, complete equality, mutual respect, and mutual non-interference in each other’s internal affairs, the CCP will pursue exchanges and cooperation with political parties and organizations from all countries and regions, so as to promote the development of relations between countries. "
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016","– To stay true to why we started out and continue going forward, we must preserve the advanced nature and purity of the CCP; raise our ability to govern and lead; enhance our capacity to withstand risks, resist corruption, and prevent degradation; and constantly advance a grand new undertaking of self-improvement by the CCP. "
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016"," China’s success hinges on the CCP. The leadership of the CCP constitutes the most essential attribute of Chinese socialism, and the greatest strength of this system. The foundation and lifeblood of the CCP and the country, and the interests and wellbeing of all Chinese people, boil down to upholding and improving the leadership of the CCP. "
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016","The self-improvement of the CCP, a political party with more than 88 million members, more than 4.4 million organizations, and that governs a country of more than 1.3 billion people on a long-term basis, has a major impact on the big picture. CCP’s self-improvement must reach whatever stage its causes and the people arrive at. This is a basic rule that must be observed as we intensify the self-improvement of the CCP. "
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016","The most essential attributes of Marxist political parties are their advanced nature and purity. In intensifying CCP’s self-improvement, our aim is to combat all problems that weaken the Party’s advanced nature and undermine its purity, so that the CCP can be healed and cleansed. With the political courage to make itself the target of reform, the entire CCP must devote major efforts to addressing pronounced problems within itself; enhance its capacity to remain pure and to improve, renew, and surpass itself; and withstand the “four major tests” and “four major dangers,” thus ensuring that the CCP remains the firm leading core of the cause of Chinese socialism. "
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016"," To do a good job of governing the country, we must first do a good job of governing the CCP, and that means governing it strictly. If we cannot manage the Party effectively, or govern it with the necessary stringency, then the problems within the Party that the public feel most strongly about will go unsolved, and our Party will eventually lose the right to govern, being unavoidably eliminated by history. Effective governance hinges on strict governance. We need to integrate the requirement of strict governance throughout all processes in the running of the Party, carrying out a genuine, brave, and constant effort to govern the Party. "
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016"," The staidness of political activities within the CCP constitutes the foundation for comprehensively governing the Party with strict discipline. To do this, it must begin by strictly regulating its internal political activities. We must enhance and regulate political activities within the Party; strictly enforce CCP’s political discipline and political rules; make political activities within the Party more political, more relevant to the current time, more principled, and more effective; and comprehensively purify the political environment within the Party. All members of the CCP must enhance their political integrity, keep in mind the big picture, follow the core leadership of the CCP Central Committee, and act consistently with CCP Central Committee policy, ensuring that they remain loyal to the Party, that they share its concerns, and that they assume their responsibilities and fulfill their obligations to it. "
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016","The CCP’s conduct amounts to its image. Like a barometer, the conduct of the CCP indicates the relationship between the Party, its officials, and the public, and tells us how the support of the public will shift. When the CCP upholds good conduct, and the people enjoy peace of mind, the Party and people are able to stand together through thick and thin. As past experience has proven, as long as we genuinely govern the CCP strictly and have the courage to govern it strictly, there are no issues involving the conduct of the CCP that cannot be resolved through CCP’s self-improvement. Such self-improvement is a never-ending effort. “How can one correct others if he himself is not upright?” Beginning with the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau, the Political Bureau, the CCP Central Committee, and senior officials, we must engage in a constant effort to improve the conduct of the CCP, and uphold and promote our Party’s fine traditions. Through a routine, meticulous, and sustained effort, we must improve the conduct of the CCP in all respects and ensure that the Party always stands with and maintains its bond with the people.  "
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016","The biggest threat the CCP faces as a governing party is corruption. Since its 18th National Congress in 2012, the CCP has been committed to both caging the “tigers” and swatting the “flies.” Not only have we created a deterrent so that officials dare not become corrupt, we have also yielded initial results in our efforts to ensure that officials cannot and have no desire to commit acts of corruption. All this indicates that the fight against corruption is in the process of gathering unstoppable momentum. We must remain constantly alert of the need to combat corruption, foster integrity, and prevent degradation. Party officials at all levels should view the power they possess in the correct light. Maintaining noble aspirations, they should treat the people, the Party, the law, and the rules with awe; exercise their power justly, lawfully, honestly, and for the good of the people; and maintain the political character of communists by resisting corruption and remaining pure at heart. With unbreakable will, we must maintain zero-tolerance on corruption, ensure that all cases of corruption are investigated and all acts of corruption punished, and see to it that the corrupt have nowhere to hide within the Party. "
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016","A great struggle and cause demands high-caliber officials. We must continue to stress both professional ability and moral integrity, with added emphasis on integrity, and appoint officials on the basis of merit, regardless of their origins. Putting our cause first, we must act in a fair and upright manner and resolutely prevent and rectify undesirable tendencies in the selection and appointment of personnel, so as to carefully cultivate, promptly discover, and appropriately employ the good officials that our Party and people need. "
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016"," An important element for officials to rise up is to use virtue to cultivate oneself, establish one’s authority, and win the trust of the people. Every Party-member official is required to adhere to the Three Stricts and Three Honests; maintain the right worldview, outlook on life, and values; be mindful of the Party, the people, their responsibilities, and the rules; and regard selfless contribution to the causes of the Party and people as their highest aspiration in life. By keeping their knowledge up to date and their practical skills sharp, officials in positions of leadership should ensure that their professional competence and abilities keep up with the pace of change, ensuring that they do not become misguided or confused due to lack of knowledge. They should strive to become highly proficient in their area of work. "

Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016","Building a solid national defense capacity and strong military that is commensurate with China’s international standing, and that can meet the country’s security and developmental needs is a strategic task of China’s socialist modernization. We need to coordinate the development of the economy and national defense, and work to make the military more revolutionary, modern, and standardized in every respect. We must uphold absolute CCP leadership over the armed forces; focus on CCP’s goal of building strong armed forces under new conditions; comprehensively implement a policy of developing the military through political work, strengthening it through reform, and governing it according to law; broaden and deepen our preparations for military conflict; foster a new generation of revolutionary soldiers who are dedicated, capable, valiant, and morally motivated; and strive to build a people’s army that follows the command of the CCP, is capable of winning battles, and has a fine style of work. China adheres to a strategic principle of active defense. It will not threaten the use of military force on a whim, nor will it impulsively show off its military strength on others’ doorsteps. Going around showing off one’s strength all over the place is not a symbol of strength, nor is it going to scare anyone. We need to further implement an integrated military-civilian development strategy; accelerate our efforts to build a modernized armed police force; strengthen our national defense mobilization capacity and reserve strength; and consolidate unity between the government and the armed forces and between the people and the armed forces. "
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016","Advancing the process of China’s peaceful reunification, and accomplishing this great cause is a prerequisite for realizing the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The success of “one country, two systems” in practice has been universally acknowledged, and this policy continues to go strong. Our confidence in and commitment to “one country, two systems” will never be shaken, regardless of what difficulties or challenges we may encounter. We will fully implement the principle of “one country, two systems,” according to which the people of Hong Kong govern Hong Kong, the people of Macao govern Macao, and both regions enjoy a high degree of autonomy. We will act in strict compliance with China’s Constitution and the basic laws of Hong Kong and Macao; support the chief executives and governments of both special administrative regions in lawfully governing and executing their duties; and support Hong Kong and Macao in developing their economies, improving public wellbeing, advancing democracy, and promoting harmony. "
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016","Maintaining peaceful relations across the Taiwan Straits represents the right approach to preserving peace, promoting common development, and benefiting people on both sides of the Straits. It is also a path of great promise that will lead us towards peaceful reunification. Upholding the “1992 Consensus” and opposing “Taiwan Independence” constitutes the political foundation for the peaceful development of cross-Straits relations. We resolutely oppose separatist forces advocating “Taiwan secession”: 1.3 billion Chinese people, and the entire Chinese nation, will never allow anyone to carry out separatist activities at any time or in any form. The people on both sides of the Straits are brothers and sisters, members of the same family whose blood runs thicker than water. All compatriots will benefit when the nation is strong and prosperous, but all will suffer when it is weak and divided. Cherishing the interests of the entire nation, people on both sides of the Straits should join hands in a common effort to make the Chinese Dream – the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation – a reality. "

With their youth, they should create youthful families, a youthful country, a youthful nation, a youthful human race, a youthful earth, and a youthful universe, from which they can take a lifetime of fulfillment.” The passion and dedication of the youth are embodied in everything that the CCP has achieved over the past 95 years. The entire Party must care about youths, show concern for youths, and listen to youths, serving wholeheartedly as their confidant and their guide. "
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016","Our country’s youth should fully understand the glorious and great history of the Chinese people’s tireless struggle since the advent of modern times.

Today, we are closer than ever to realizing the goal of national rejuvenation, and more confident and able than ever to realize this goal. We can now say with complete confidence that the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation has to be achieved, and definitely will be achieved. "
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016"," On the morning of March 23, 1949, when the central leadership of the CCP set off from its base in Xibaipo to Beijing, Mao Zedong said: “Today we race to the capital for the imperial examination.” As the past 60 years have proven, the CCP has achieved an outstanding result in its historic test. However, this test is by no means over, and it is continuing right now. The entire efforts of the CCP to rally and lead the people today represent the continuation of this test. "
Speech by President Xi Jinping at a Ceremony Marking the 95th Anniversary of the Founding of the Communist Party of China,Xi Jinping,"Jul 1, 2016","“Long as the way is, I will keep on searching high and low.” The entire CCP must stay true to its cause and continue marching forward. It must maintain its modesty and prudence and avoid arrogance and impetuosity. It must preserve its tradition of bitter struggle, have the courage to change and innovate, and ensure that it never becomes rigid nor stops in its tracks. And it must continue to rise to the challenge of its ongoing historic test, striving to produce new and even more outstanding results for history and for the people. "

Traditional and non-traditional security threats keep emerging. Instability and uncertainties are growing in the international situation. Global threats and challenges require global responses. With that in mind, I wish to share with you the following three proposals:"
"Standing Together to Fight COVID-19, Promote Recovery and Safeguard Peace – Speech by Xi Jinping at the Official Ceremony of the Third Edition of the Paris Peace Forum",Xi Jinping,"Nov 12, 2020","First, let us show solidarity and help each other to jointly fight COVID-19. The coronavirus is still wreaking havoc around the world. We need to put people and life first, place people’s well-being front and center, respect science, and make more targeted and concerted response. We need to give full play to the crucial leadership role of the World Health Organization in facilitating the joint global response against COVID-19."

"Standing Together to Fight COVID-19, Promote Recovery and Safeguard Peace – Speech by Xi Jinping at the Official Ceremony of the Third Edition of the Paris Peace Forum",Xi Jinping,"Nov 12, 2020","Second, let us embrace openness and cooperation to jointly promote recovery. Two weeks ago, the Fifth Plenum of the 19th CCP Central Committee deliberated on and adopted the recommendations on formulating China’s 14th five-year plan for economic and social development and the long-range goals for 2035. The course has been charted for China’s development in the years ahead. China will continue to follow the new development philosophy, foster a new development paradigm, and pursue high-quality development. To this end, China will stay committed to deepening reform and opening wider to the world.

It also holds the key to promoting recovery. Both China and Europe are followers of green development, and both are committed to the implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change. Not long ago, I announced China’s initiative to scale up the nationally determined contributions to peak carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. Implementation plans will be drawn up accordingly. Next year, China, Europe and France will each host an international conference on  biodiversity, on climate change and on nature conservation. We could take such opportunities to deepen cooperation in these fields."

China follows an independent foreign policy of peace. China is committed to the path of peaceful development. We call on all countries to uphold international law and the basic norms governing international relations, determine their position on the merits of each matter, and rise above ideological bias and confrontation. China will step up communication and coordination with France and other countries and play a positive part for the political settlement of international and regional issues and for upholding world peace and stability."

Statement by Xi Jinping at the General Debate of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly,Xi Jinping,"Sep 22, 2020","This year marks the 75th anniversary of the victory in the World Anti-Fascist War and the founding of the United Nations (UN). Yesterday, the high-level meeting to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the UN was held.

Statement by Xi Jinping at the General Debate of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly,Xi Jinping,"Sep 22, 2020","We humans are battling COVID-19, a virus that has ravaged the world and has kept resurging. In this fight, we have witnessed the efforts of governments, dedication of medical workers, exploration of scientists, and perseverance of the public. People of different countries have come together. With courage, resolve and compassion which lit the dark hour, we have confronted the disaster head on. The virus will be defeated. Humanity will win this battle!"
Statement by Xi Jinping at the General Debate of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly,Xi Jinping,"Sep 22, 2020","– Facing the virus, we should put people and life first. We should mobilize all resources to make a science-based and targeted response. No case should be missed and no patient should be left untreated. The spread of the virus must be contained."
Statement by Xi Jinping at the General Debate of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly,Xi Jinping,"Sep 22, 2020","– Facing the virus, we should enhance solidarity and get this through together. We should follow the guidance of science, give full play to the leading role of the World Health Organization, and launch a joint international response to beat this pandemic. Any attempt of politicizing the issue or stigmatization must be rejected."
Statement by Xi Jinping at the General Debate of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly,Xi Jinping,"Sep 22, 2020","– Facing the virus, we should adopt comprehensive and long-term control measures. We should reopen businesses and schools in an orderly way, so as to create jobs, boost the economy, and restore economic and social order and vitality. The major economies need to step up macro policy coordination. We should not only restart our own economies, but also contribute to global recovery."
Statement by Xi Jinping at the General Debate of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly,Xi Jinping,"Sep 22, 2020","– Facing the virus, we should show concern for and accommodate the need of developing countries, especially African countries. The international community needs to take timely and robust measures in such fields as debt relief and international assistance, ensure the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and help these countries overcome their difficulties."
Statement by Xi Jinping at the General Debate of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly,Xi Jinping,"Sep 22, 2020","Seventy-five years ago, China made historic contributions to winning the World Anti-Fascist War and supported the founding of the United Nations.

Going forward, we will continue to share our epidemic control practices as well as diagnostics and therapeutics with other countries, provide support and assistance to countries in need, ensure stable global anti-epidemic supply chains, and actively participate in the global research on tracing the source and transmission routes of the virus. At the moment, several COVID-19 vaccines developed by China are in Phase III clinical trials. When their development is completed and they are available for use, these vaccines will be made a global public good, and they will be provided to other developing countries on a priority basis. China will honor its commitment of providing US$2 billion of international assistance over two years, further international cooperation in such fields as agriculture, poverty reduction, education, women and children, and climate change, and support other countries in restoring economic and social development."
Statement by Xi Jinping at the General Debate of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly,Xi Jinping,"Sep 22, 2020","Mr. President,"
Statement by Xi Jinping at the General Debate of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly,Xi Jinping,"Sep 22, 2020","The history of development of human society is a history of our struggles against all challenges and difficulties and our victories over them. At present, the world is battling the COVID-19 pandemic as it goes through profound changes never seen in a century. Yet, peace and development remain the underlying trend of the times, and people everywhere crave even more strongly for peace, development and win-win cooperation. COVID-19 will not be the last crisis to confront humanity, so we must join hands and be prepared to meet even more global challenges."
Statement by Xi Jinping at the General Debate of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly,Xi Jinping,"Sep 22, 2020","First, COVID-19 reminds us that we are living in an interconnected global village with a common stake. All countries are closely connected and we share a common future. No country can gain from others’ difficulties or maintain stability by taking advantage of others’ troubles. To pursue a beggar-thy-neighbor policy or just watch from a safe distance when others are in danger will eventually land one in the same trouble faced by others. This is why we should embrace the vision of a community with a shared future in which everyone is bound together. We should reject attempts to build blocs to keep others out and oppose a zero-sum approach. We should see each other as members of the same big family, pursue win-win cooperation, and rise above ideological disputes and do not fall into the trap of “clash of civilizations”. More importantly, we should respect a country’s independent choice of development path and model. The world is diverse in nature, and we should turn this diversity into a constant source of inspiration driving human advancement. This will ensure that human civilizations remain colorful and diversified."
Statement by Xi Jinping at the General Debate of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly,Xi Jinping,"Sep 22, 2020","Second, COVID-19 reminds us that economic globalization is an indisputable reality and a historical trend. Burying one’s head in the sand like an ostrich in the face of economic globalization or trying to fight it with Don Quixote’s lance goes against the trend of history. Let this be clear: The world will never return to isolation, and no one can sever the ties between countries. We should not dodge the challenges of economic globalization. Instead, we must face up to major issues such as the wealth gap and the development divide. We should strike a proper balance between the government and the market, fairness and efficiency, growth and income distribution, and technology and employment so as to ensure full and balanced development that delivers benefit to people from all countries, sectors and backgrounds in an equitable way. We should pursue open and inclusive development, remain committed to building an open world economy, and uphold the multilateral trading regime with the World Trade Organization as the cornerstone. We should say no to unilateralism and protectionism, and work to ensure the stable and smooth functioning of global industrial and supply chains."
Statement by Xi Jinping at the General Debate of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly,Xi Jinping,"Sep 22, 2020","Third, COVID-19 reminds us that humankind should launch a green revolution and move faster to create a green way of development and life, preserve the environment and make Mother Earth a better place for all. Humankind can no longer afford to ignore the repeated warnings of Nature and go down the beaten path of extracting resources without investing in conservation, pursuing development at the expense of protection, and exploiting resources without restoration. The Paris Agreement on climate change charts the course for the world to transition to green and low-carbon development. It outlines the minimum steps to be taken to protect the Earth, our shared homeland, and all countries must take decisive steps to honor this Agreement. China will scale up its Intended Nationally Determined Contributions by adopting more vigorous policies and measures. We aim to have CO2 emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. We call on all countries to pursue innovative, coordinated, green and open development for all, seize the historic opportunities presented by the new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, achieve a green recovery of the world economy in the post-COVID era and thus create a powerful force driving sustainable development."
Statement by Xi Jinping at the General Debate of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly,Xi Jinping,"Sep 22, 2020","Fourth, COVID-19 reminds us that the global governance system calls for reform and improvement. COVID-19 is a major test of the governance capacity of countries; it is also a test of the global governance system. We should stay true to multilateralism and safeguard the international system with the UN at its core. Global governance should be based on the principle of extensive consultation, joint cooperation and shared benefits so as to ensure that all countries enjoy equal rights and opportunities and follow the same rules. The global governance system should adapt itself to evolving global political and economic dynamics, meet global challenges and embrace the underlying trend of peace, development and win-win cooperation. It is natural for countries to have differences. What’s important is to address them through dialogue and consultation. Countries may engage in competition, but such competition should be positive and healthy in nature. When in competition, countries should not breach the moral standard and should comply with international norms. In particular, major countries should act like major countries. They should provide more global public goods, take up their due responsibilities and live up to people’s expectations."

We will never seek hegemony, expansion, or sphere of influence. We have no intention to fight either a Cold War or a hot war with any country. We will continue to narrow differences and resolve disputes with others through dialogue and negotiation. We do not seek to develop only ourselves or engage in a zero-sum game. We will not pursue development behind closed doors. Rather, we aim to foster, over time, a new development paradigm with domestic circulation as the mainstay and domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other. This will create more space for China’s economic development and add impetus to global economic recovery and growth."

Statement by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting on the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women,Xi Jinping,"Oct 1, 2020","Mr. President, Colleagues,"
Statement by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting on the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women,Xi Jinping,"Oct 1, 2020","On the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, we gather to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing. The aim is to promote gender equality and women’s development around the world. I am glad to address this event and I wish this high-level meeting a full success."
Statement by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting on the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women,Xi Jinping,"Oct 1, 2020","Women are creators of human civilization and drivers of social progress, and they have made extraordinary achievements across all fields of endeavor. In the ongoing fight against COVID-19, female medical and epidemic control workers, researchers, community workers and volunteers over the world, braving danger and working around the clock, have fought at the front line of the battle. With their dedication and ingenuity, they have written heroic epics of saving people and protecting lives. They truly deserve our admiration."
Statement by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting on the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women,Xi Jinping,"Oct 1, 2020","In China, at the height of the battle against COVID-19, more than 40,000 health workers from across the country rushed to Hubei province, which was the hardest hit by the virus, and two-thirds of them were women. Among them was a nurse from Guangdong province who had not yet reached the age of 20. Answering a reporter’s question of whether she was too young to help others, she said, “The moment I put on the protective suit, I am not a kid anymore.” Those words moved the whole nation. In fact, many women medical workers in China, like this girl, and in their tens of thousands, have taken on the virus bravely by putting themselves in harm’s way. Their courage and hard work have shown the very best of the medical profession. Their devotion and sacrifice have kept the nation intact through difficult times."
Statement by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting on the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women,Xi Jinping,"Oct 1, 2020","Mr. President,"
Statement by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting on the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women,Xi Jinping,"Oct 1, 2020","Over the past 25 years, the powerful message of the Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing has unleashed many positive changes. The social status of women is significantly higher. Increasingly women are playing an important role of “supporting half of the sky”. Indeed, gender equality and women’s empowerment are now important goals of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development."
Statement by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting on the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women,Xi Jinping,"Oct 1, 2020","On the other hand, the spread of COVID-19 worldwide has taken a heavy toll on economy, employment and people’s life, and has brought greater challenges to women. As Secretary-General Guterres said, the gains made in gender equality over the past decades are at risk of being rolled back. In both containing COVID-19 and promoting post-COVID economic and social recovery, it is particularly important that we address the special needs of women and deliver on the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. To this end, China calls for taking the following steps:"
Statement by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting on the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women,Xi Jinping,"Oct 1, 2020","First, we need to minimize the impact of COVID-19 on women. We need to pay special attention to the health, social and psychological needs and working environment of frontline women medical workers. We also need to place the protection of women’s and girls’ rights and interests high on the agenda of both public health and economic reopening. In particular, we need to create more job opportunities for women and crack down on violations of women’s rights and interests. We need to improve social services, with priority given to special groups such as pregnant and postnatal women, and children. Special care may be given to women in difficulty such as those in poverty, old age or with disabilities. Efforts must be made to enhance benefit for women, address their concerns, and deliver results for their well-being."
Statement by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting on the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women,Xi Jinping,"Oct 1, 2020","Second, we need to strive for genuine gender equality. While posing unprecedented challenges, COVID-19 also presents an opportunity for us to draw lessons from it and reshape the future. Global development needs to be placed on a course that is more equal, inclusive and sustainable, and women’s development is an important criterion to gauge its progress. Protection of women’s rights and interests must become the commitment at the national level. As we pursue post-COVID recovery, we may create new opportunities for women to participate in decision-making and be more involved in national, economic, cultural and social governance. We need to eliminate prejudice, discrimination and violence against women and make gender equality a social norm and moral imperative observed by all."
Statement by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting on the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women,Xi Jinping,"Oct 1, 2020","Third, we need to ensure that women advance at the forefront of our times. In the 21st century, the aspiration for a better life will be meaningless without all-round progress in women’s development; this aspiration can only be achieved when women contribute even greater vision and strength to this cause. In pursuing development, we need to protect women’s rights and interests and improve their lives, and ensure that women’s development goes hand in hand with economic and social development. We need to remove barriers and create an enabling environment in which women are motivated, their creativity is unleashed to the full, and they truly feel satisfied, happy and secure. We need to fully leverage the role of the government and mobilize all stakeholders to support women and help them live their lives to the full."
Statement by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting on the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women,Xi Jinping,"Oct 1, 2020","Fourth, we need to enhance global cooperation in advancing women’s development. Without a peaceful and stable global environment and sustainable development, and without leveraging the UN’s key coordinating role, the cause of women’s development cannot move forward. We support the UN in making women’s development a priority. Our Organization should do more, both to eliminate violence, discrimination, poverty and other old problems and to address new challenges such as bridging the gender digital divide, so as to make women-related targets early harvest results of its 2030 Agenda. We also need to support greater representation of women in the UN system. UN Women should expand its toolkit for promoting gender equality and improve the global roadmap for women’s development."
Statement by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting on the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women,Xi Jinping,"Oct 1, 2020","Colleagues,"
Statement by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting on the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women,Xi Jinping,"Oct 1, 2020","Equality between men and women is a basic state policy in China. We have put in place a legal system comprising over 100 laws and regulations for fully protecting women’s rights and interests. As a matter of fact, China is recognized by the World Health Organization as one of the ten fast-track countries in women’s and children’s health. In China, the gender gap in compulsory education has been largely closed. Women account for over 40 percent of the country’s workforce, and more than half of China’s Internet start-up businesses are set up by women."
Statement by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting on the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women,Xi Jinping,"Oct 1, 2020","Five years ago, I proposed a Global Leaders’ Meeting on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment. Now, the host of proposals I put forward at the meeting for advancing global cooperation in this endeavor have all been implemented. And China is prepared to do even more to support the global cause of women’s development. In the coming five years, China will donate another 10 million dollars to UN Women. China will continue to fund the UNESCO Prize for Girls’ and Women’s Education to support this global effort. China also proposes the convening in 2025 of another Global Leaders’ Meeting on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment."
Statement by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting on the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women,Xi Jinping,"Oct 1, 2020","Mr. President,"
Statement by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting on the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women,Xi Jinping,"Oct 1, 2020",We still have a long way to go and need to work real hard to build a world in which women are free from discrimination as well as a society of inclusive development. Let us work together and redouble efforts to promote gender equality and advance the global cause of women’s development.
Statement by Xi Jinping at the High-level Meeting on the Twenty-fifth Anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women,Xi Jinping,"Oct 1, 2020",Thank you.

Staying True to Our Founding Mission and Forging Ahead on a New Journey of SCO Cooperation – Statement by Xi Jinping at the 21st Meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization,Xi Jinping,"Sep 17, 2021","First, we need to follow the journey of enhancing solidarity and cooperation. We should make the most of the meeting mechanisms and platforms at all levels, step up policy dialogue, communication and coordination, respect each other’s legitimate concerns and promptly resolve problems that may arise and affect our cooperation, thus keeping the SCO on a steady course of development. We should maintain firm confidence in our systems, reject condescending lecturing, and firmly support countries in exploring development paths and governance models that are compatible with their national conditions.

To protect the lives and health of people from around the world, China has provided close to 1.2 billion doses of finished and bulk vaccines to over 100 countries and international organizations, thus becoming the biggest vaccine provider in the world.

This will help countries in need build capacity and improve the lives of their people.

In addressing international relations, we should observe the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits. We need to practice true multilateralism and oppose actions that use the name of so-called rules to undermine the international order and cause confrontation and division.

Currently, our country is in a period of historical confluence where were are achieving our “two centennial” objectives. In order to adhere to and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics, we need to rely on the rule of law even more and strengthen the Party’s leadership of the comprehensive rule of law even more. The Party Central Committee’s decision to establish the Central Committee for the Comprehensive Rule of Law is primarily based on the following considerations. "
Strengthen the Party’s Leadership in the Comprehensive Rule of Law,Xi Jinping,"Aug 24, 2018","First, there is the need to implement the spirit of the 19th Party Congress and strengthen the Party’s centralized and unified leadership of the comprehensive rule of law.

The 19th Party Congress put forward new tasks for advancing the comprehensive rule of law in the new era, clarifying that by 2035, we must basically have established a country under the rule of law, a government under the rule of law, and a society under the rule of law. To better implement these goals and tasks, the Party Central Committee listened to the opinions and suggestions of all parties and decided to establish the Central Committee for the Comprehensive Rule of Law. The committee was established to improve the Party’s leadership system and working mechanism for comprehensively governing the country according to law, strengthen the leadership of the Party Central Committee in areas such as scientific legislation, strict law enforcement, impartial justice, and compliance with the law by all, and more forcefully promote the implementation of the Party Central Committee’s decisions and deployments. "
Strengthen the Party’s Leadership in the Comprehensive Rule of Law,Xi Jinping,"Aug 24, 2018","I have repeatedly spoken of the question of the relationship between Party leadership and the rule of law. Promoting the institutionalization and rule of law of the Party’s leadership is not only a proper means of strengthening the Party’s leadership, but also an important task in constructing the rule of law. Why is it that our country can maintain long-term stability without chaos? The fundamental reason is that we always adhere to the leadership of the Communist Party. The leadership of the Party is the “magic staff” (定海神针, the staff of Sun Wukong in novel Journey to the West) of the continuous development of the Party and the country. For this amendment of the Constitution, on the basis that the preamble of the Constitution confirms the leadership of the Party, we have clearly stipulated in the general outline that the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CCP) is the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics and strengthened the Party’s leadership position in overseeing the overall situation and coordinating all parties. After the amendment of the constitution, the response by all parties has been very good. We must continue to promote the institutionalization and rule of law of the Party’s leadership, continuously improve the Party’s leadership system and working mechanisms, and implement the Party’s leadership throughout the entire process and all aspects of the comprehensive rule of law. "
Strengthen the Party’s Leadership in the Comprehensive Rule of Law,Xi Jinping,"Aug 24, 2018","Only when governing the Party according to regulations goes deep into the hearts of the Party can ruling the country according to the law penetrate into the hearts of the people. Since the 18th Party Congress, we have formulated and revised more than 140 central Party laws and regulations and introduced a number of landmark, critical, and basic institutions for laws and regulations. The issue that there must be rules to follow has basically been solved, and the next step is to enforce the rules strictly so that internal Party laws and regulations can be truly implemented. The vast majority of officials removed due to violations stated that they did not understand Party discipline and national laws in their confessions. Why do so many high-ranking cadres in the Party take the path of crime? The fundamental reason is that their ideals and beliefs have been shaken, but the lack of reverence for Party discipline and national laws is also an important reason. "
Strengthen the Party’s Leadership in the Comprehensive Rule of Law,Xi Jinping,"Aug 24, 2018","Second, this shows the need to study and resolve major issues and major problems in governing the country according to law and to coordinate and the need to promote the construction of the system of socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics and a socialist country ruled by law. The comprehensive rule of law is a long-term and important historical task as well as a profound social change. At present, there are many weak links in legislation, law enforcement, justice, and compliance with the law. Reforms in the rule of law field face many difficult obstacles and there is an urgent need to strengthen overall coordination from the level of the Party Central Committee. "
Strengthen the Party’s Leadership in the Comprehensive Rule of Law,Xi Jinping,"Aug 24, 2018","To implement the new development concept and realize the transition of the economy from high-speed growth to high-quality development, we must adhere to the rule of law as our guide. Regarding the relationship between development and the rule of law, there is still the misunderstanding that “development is the most important while the rule of law is merely permitted” (发展要上、法治要让) in some places. Last year, the Party Central Committee dealt with the ecological environment problems of the Qilian Mountain National Park, and a group of Party and government officials were disciplined. The Regulations on the Management of Gansu Qilian Mountain National Park has undergone three revisions and some of its regulations have always been inconsistent with the Regulations of the People’s Republic of China on Nature Reserves. The “intentional laxity” (放水, to throw the game) in legislation and “forfeit” (放弃) of law enforcement have led to serious damage to the Qilian Mountain ecosystem. Such lessons must be taken deeply to heart. "
Strengthen the Party’s Leadership in the Comprehensive Rule of Law,Xi Jinping,"Aug 24, 2018","The foundation and strength of the Party lie in the people. Now, the people’s yearning for a better life has extended further in the directions of democracy, the rule of law, fairness, justice, security, and the environment. The people’s opinions on chaotic application, inaction, and judicial injustice in law enforcement are relatively unified. This should become the focus and point of effort for our enforcement of the rule of law. For example, some underworld forces have been conducting illegal activities such as the gathering of crowds, monopolistic operations, extortion, and the operation of gambling venues for a long time, but the people dare not say anything. How can underworld forces grow from small to large right under our noses? In my opinion, there are situations in which law enforcement agencies remain inactive. Some local law enforcement agencies have even cooperated with the underworld forces, serving as their protective umbrellas. Law enforcement agencies represent the interests of the people and must not become a protective umbrella for clan forces and underworld forces. In recent years, the judiciary has corrected a number of wrongful convictions from unjust, false, and erroneous cases such as the unjust murder of Gejiletu, the Nie Shubin case, and the Nian Bin case in accordance with the law, which has been well received by the general public. There are many reasons for wrongful convictions, including the lack of basic judicial conscience and responsibility of judicial personnel. Deeper-level causes are that the allocation of judicial powers and the mechanisms through which power operates are unscientific and that institutional mechanisms for the mutual restriction of the powers of investigation, prosecution, trial, and enforcement have not really taken shape. The recent case of the Changchun Changsheng counterfeit vaccine resulted from non-compliance with laws, lax law enforcement, and the view that laws and regulations are nothing important. This requires that we promote strict, impartial, and civilized law enforcement so that the people will truly feel surrounded by fairness and justice. "
Strengthen the Party’s Leadership in the Comprehensive Rule of Law,Xi Jinping,"Aug 24, 2018","China is going out into the world and participating in international affairs as a responsible power. We must be adept at applying the rule of law. In external struggles, we must take up legal weapons, occupy the commanding heights of the rule of law, and dare to say no to saboteurs and disruptors. The global governance system is in a critical period of adjustment and reform. We must actively participate in the formulation of international rules and be a participant, promoter, and leader in the process of global governance reform. "
Strengthen the Party’s Leadership in the Comprehensive Rule of Law,Xi Jinping,"Aug 24, 2018","Third, there is the need to promote the realization of the “two centennial” objectives and to provide legal assurance for the realization of the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Both history and the current reality tell us that the rule of law leads to the prosperity of the country, and the strong rule of law leads to a strong country. Looking at ancient China, all times of prosperity were periods with relatively sound legal systems. During the Spring and Autumn and Warring States Period, the Legalists advocated “rule by law” and put it into practice in the Qin State of Yongzhou. Shang Yang “planted trees and built trust” and emphasized that “laws must be clear and orders must be implemented.” Qin quickly became one of the powerful states and eventually led the unification of the six states under Emperor Qin Shihuang. Liu Bang, who became Emperor Gaozu of the Han Dynasty, “established three chapters of law” with the people of Guanzhong, which played an important role in the Han dominance of China. The 60 headings of the Han legal code formed during the reign of Han Wudi, were used by the Han Dynasty for nearly 400 years. Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty saw obedience to the law as the most important task of governing the country. The Code of the Zhenguan achieved the “rule of during the Zhenguan period” (translator’s note: Zhenguan is the name of the reign period of Tang Taizong). Revisions to the Code of the Zhenguan produced the Tang Code, which laid the legal cornerstone for the flourishing of the Tang Dynasty. World history shows the prosperity of a country often arises with the rule of law. More than 3,000 years ago, when Hammurabi became king of Babylon, he unified the national laws and formulated the Code of Hammurabi, the first statutory law code in human history. The laws in this code were engraved on stone stelae, which brought the kingdom of ancient Babylon into a flourishing period in ancient Mesopotamia. The famous German jurist Rudolf von Jhering said that the Roman Empire conquered the world three times, the first time by force, the second time by religion, and the third time by law. Their force perished due to the demise of the Roman Empire, their religion lost its influence as the people’s ideological consciousness increased and science developed. Only the law with which they conquered the world remains as their most enduring conquest. "
Strengthen the Party’s Leadership in the Comprehensive Rule of Law,Xi Jinping,"Aug 24, 2018","Since the dawn of the modern era, Chinese people with lofty ideals also realized this problem. Since the Reform Movement of 1898 and the revision of laws in the late Qing Dynasty, the Chinese have been calling for the rule of law. However, under the historical and political conditions of the time, a reform of the legal system alone could not change the nature of the old Chinese society and the tragic fate of the Chinese people. Our Party has been in power for more than 60 years. Although we have experienced ups and downs, we have remained committed to the rule of law. From the “May 4th Constitution” to the Constitution recently revised; from a “socialist legal system” to “socialist rule of law”; from “there are laws to follow, laws must be followed, law enforcement must be strict, violations must be investigated” to “scientific legislation, strict law enforcement, impartial justice, and compliance with the law by all”, our Party has become increasingly aware that the rule of law is indispensable to governing the country. "
Strengthen the Party’s Leadership in the Comprehensive Rule of Law,Xi Jinping,"Aug 24, 2018","In short, whether for achieving the “two centennial” objectives or to realizing the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, the comprehensive rule of law is both an important content and an important guarantee. We have included the comprehensive rule of law in the “Four Comprehensives” strategic layout. This is to provide long-term and stable rule of law assurance for establishing a well-off society in an all-round way, deepening reforms in an all-round way, and the comprehensive and strict governance of the Party. I have repeatedly emphasized that, in the “Four Comprehensives,” the comprehensive rule of law has a fundamental and safeguarding role. In the overall planning and promotion of great struggles, great projects, great undertakings, and great dreams, and on the new journey of building China into a modernized socialist country in an all-round way, we must allow the rule of law to better play its role in securing the conveying long-term benefits. "
Strengthen the Party’s Leadership in the Comprehensive Rule of Law,Xi Jinping,"Aug 24, 2018","II. Adhere to the Guidance of the New Concept, New Thinking, and New Strategy of the Comprehensive Rule of Law and Unswervingly Follow the Path of Socialist Rule of Law with Chinese Characteristics "
Strengthen the Party’s Leadership in the Comprehensive Rule of Law,Xi Jinping,"Aug 24, 2018","Since the 18th Party Congress, the Party Central Committee has made a series of major decisions and proposed a series of major measures for the comprehensive rule of law. We have adapted to the requirements of the development of the Party and the country, improved the legislative system, strengthened legislation in key areas, and improved the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics. We have insisted on governing the country according to the Constitution, amending the Constitution to keep pace with the times, establishing a national Constitution Day, establishing a constitutional oath system, and comprehensively strengthening the implementation and supervision of the Constitution. We have promoted the construction of a government under the rule of law, drastically reduced matters requiring administrative review and approval, completely ended non-administrative license approvals, established a list of government powers, negative lists, and responsibility lists, standardized administrative powers, and promoted strict, impartial, and civilized law enforcement. We have unswervingly promoted the reform of the rule of law field, abolished the reeducation through labor system, promoted the reform of the judicial accountability system, the post system, and the trial-centered criminal procedural system, corrected a number of major unjust, false and erroneous cases in accordance with the law, and significantly improved judicial quality, efficiency, and credibility. We have insisted on making the popularization (民普, education of the public) and observance of the law the basic work of governing the country according to law, implemented the responsibility system of “whoever enforces the law should popularize the law” for state institutions, incorporated rule of law education into the national education system, and significantly strengthened the concept of rule of law throughout the whole society. We have promoted the construction of rule of law teams, developed and strengthened legal service teams, and strengthen legal education and the training of rule of law talents. We have insisted on governing in accordance with the law, strengthened the establishment of institutions of internal Party laws and regulations, promoted the reform of the national supervisory system, punished crimes of corruption in accordance with the law, and achieved remarkable results in comprehensive and strict Party governance. "
Strengthen the Party’s Leadership in the Comprehensive Rule of Law,Xi Jinping,"Aug 24, 2018","Since the 18th Party Congress, we have put forward a series of new concepts, new ideas, and new strategies for the comprehensive rule of law and clarified the guiding ideology, development path, work layout, and key tasks of the comprehensive rule of law. Overall, these efforts can be grouped into the 10 aspects below. "
Strengthen the Party’s Leadership in the Comprehensive Rule of Law,Xi Jinping,"Aug 24, 2018","First, uphold the strengthening of the Party’s leadership over governing the country according to law. The leadership of the Party is the most fundamental guarantee of the socialist rule of law. The comprehensive rule of law will not weaken the Party’s leadership in any way, but strengthen and improve the Party’s leadership, continuously improve the Party’s capacity and level of leadership over governing the country by law, and consolidate the Party’s ruling position. We must persist in realizing the Party’s leadership in legislation, ensuring law enforcement, supporting justice, and taking the lead in compliance with the law, improve the institutions and working mechanisms of the Party’s leadership of the comprehensive rule of law, work through legal procedures make the Party’s propositions the will of the state and form laws, and use laws to ensure the effective implementation of the Party’s policies to ensure that the country is moving in the correct direction of the comprehensive rule of law. "
Strengthen the Party’s Leadership in the Comprehensive Rule of Law,Xi Jinping,"Aug 24, 2018","Second, uphold the dominant position of the people. The construction of the rule of law must be for the people, rely on the people, benefit the people, and protect the people. We must firmly grasp the pursuit of social fairness and justice as a value of the rule of law and strive to make the people feel the impartiality and justice of every legal institution, every law enforcement decision, and every judicial case. We must implement the whole process of reflecting the people’s interests, reflecting the people’s wishes, safeguarding the people’s rights and interests, and enhancing the people’s well-being through the process of governing the country according to law and ensure that the people manage state affairs, manage economic and cultural undertakings, and manage social affairs through various channels and forms under the leadership of the Party. "
Strengthen the Party’s Leadership in the Comprehensive Rule of Law,Xi Jinping,"Aug 24, 2018","Third, uphold the socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics. We must take the right road in comprehensively promoting the rule of law. Proceeding from China’s national conditions and reality, we must follow the path to the rule of law that suits us, we must never copy the models and practices of other countries, and we must not follow the so-called “constitutionalism,” “three powers,” and “independent judiciary” of the West. "
Strengthen the Party’s Leadership in the Comprehensive Rule of Law,Xi Jinping,"Aug 24, 2018","Fourth, uphold the building of a system of socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics. The system of socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics is the legal manifestation of the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics. We must grasp the building of a socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics as our overall starting point, strive to form a complete legal specification system, an efficient implementation system for the rule of law, a strict supervision system for the rule of law, and a strong assurance system for rule of law, form a complete system of internal Party laws and regulations, and continue to create new systems in the comprehensive rule of law. "
Strengthen the Party’s Leadership in the Comprehensive Rule of Law,Xi Jinping,"Aug 24, 2018","Fifth, uphold the common promotion of national governance, exercise of power, and administration according to law and the integrated construction of a country under the rule of law, a government under the rule of law, and a society under the rule of law. The comprehensive rule of law is a systematic project, which requires coordination, grasping the key points, and overall planning and more attention paid to systemicity, integrity, and synergy. National governance, exercise of power, and administration according to law is an organic whole and the key is that the Party must adhere to exercising power by law, and governments at all levels must adhere to administration by law. The nation, government, and society based on the rule of law have their respective focuses and complement each other. A nation ruled by law is the goal of the construction of the rule of law, a government ruled by law is the main entity for the construction of a nation ruled by law, and a society ruled by law is the basis for building a nation ruled by law. We must be adept at using institutions and laws to govern the country and improve the Party’s level of scientific governance, democratic governance, and governance according to law. "
Strengthen the Party’s Leadership in the Comprehensive Rule of Law,Xi Jinping,"Aug 24, 2018","Six, uphold the governance of the country and exercise of power based on the Constitution. To rule the country according to law, the first thing is to adhere to ruling the country according to the Constitution; to govern according to law, the first thing is to adhere to governing according to the constitution. The Party leads the people to formulate and implement the Constitution and laws. The Party itself must act within the scope of the Constitution and laws. All citizens, social organizations, and state institutions must use the Constitution and laws as their codes of conduct and exercise their rights or authority and perform duties or responsibilities in accordance with the Constitution and laws. No one shall have the privilege to go beyond the Constitution and laws, and all violations of the Constitution and laws must be investigated. "
Strengthen the Party’s Leadership in the Comprehensive Rule of Law,Xi Jinping,"Aug 24, 2018","Seven, uphold the overall promotion of scientific legislation, strict law enforcement, impartial justice, and respect for the law by all people. To resolve outstanding contradictions and problems in the fields of legislation, law enforcement, justice, and compliance with the law, we must unswervingly promote the reform of the rule of law field. We must firmly grasp the key link in comprehensive rule of law, improve the legislative system, and improve the quality of legislation. We must promote strict law enforcement, rationalize the law enforcement system, improve administrative law enforcement procedures, and comprehensively implement the administrative law enforcement responsibility system. We must support the judiciary in its independent exercise of its powers in accordance with the law and improve the institutional arrangements for the division of responsibility, mutual cooperation, and mutual restraint of judicial powers. We must increase the efforts to popularize the law among all people and cultivate a rule of law environment in which the whole society handles affairs according to the law, goes to the law in case of trouble, solve problems using the law, to resolve contradictions by relying on the law. "
Strengthen the Party’s Leadership in the Comprehensive Rule of Law,Xi Jinping,"Aug 24, 2018","Eight, uphold the handling of the dialectical relationships involved in the comprehensive rule of law. The comprehensive rule of law requires us to correctly handle the relationship between politics and the rule of law, reform and the rule of law, the rule of law and the rule by virtue, the rule of law, and the governing the Party according to regulations. The socialist rule of law must uphold the Party’s leadership, and the Party’s leadership must rely on the socialist rule of law. “Reform and the rule of law are like the two wings of a bird or the two wheels of a cart.” We must insist on advancing reform under the rule of law and perfect the rule of law in the process of reform. We must uphold the combination of governing the country by law and governing the country by virtue and realize the mutual complementary and enhancement of the rule of law and the rule by virtue. We must give play to the complementary effects of governing the country according to law and governing the Party according to regulations and ensure that the Party both governs the country in accordance with the Constitution and laws and strictly governs and administers the Party in accordance with internal Party laws and regulations. "
Strengthen the Party’s Leadership in the Comprehensive Rule of Law,Xi Jinping,"Aug 24, 2018","Nine, uphold the building of a high-quality legal work team with both ability and political integrity. To comprehensively promote the rule of law, we must focus on building a socialist legal work team that is loyal to the Party, the country, the people, and the law. We must strengthen education on ideals and beliefs, carry out in-depth education on socialist core values and the philosophy of socialist rule of law, promote the formalization, specialization, and professionalization of specialized teams for the rule of law, and improve the level of their professional qualities and specialization. We must persist in moral education, cultivate morality and law, innovate the training mechanisms for rule of law talents, and strive to cultivate a large number of high-quality rule of law talents and reserve forces. "
Strengthen the Party’s Leadership in the Comprehensive Rule of Law,Xi Jinping,"Aug 24, 2018","Tenth, uphold the seizing on the “critical minority” of leading cadres. Leading cadres’ concrete exercise of the Party’s ruling power and the state’s legislative, administrative, supervisory, and judicial powers is the key to the comprehensive rule of law. Leading cadres must take the lead in respecting the rule of law, respecting the law, understanding and mastering the law, abiding by discipline and law, defending the rule of law, enforcing the rule of law, and acting in accordance with the law, continuously improve their ability to use rule of law thinking and methods to deepen reform, promote development, resolve contradictions, and maintain stability, be a model of respect for law, study of law, compliance with law, and use of law, and drive the whole society to respect for law, study of law, compliance with law, and use of law with practical actions. "
Strengthen the Party’s Leadership in the Comprehensive Rule of Law,Xi Jinping,"Aug 24, 2018","These new ideas, new thoughts, and new strategies are the latest achievements of the Sinicization of Marxist thought on the rule of law and are fundamental to the comprehensive rule of law. We must adhere to them long-term and continuously enrich and develop them. "

Over the past hundred years, the CCP has united and led the Chinese people in working ceaselessly towards the tremendous transformation of the Chinese nation from standing up and growing prosperous to becoming strong. Over the past hundred years, the CCP has persisted in closely associating the future of the Chinese people with that of other peoples of the world and steered the course of China’s development amid the general trend of the world and the currents of the times to promote common development and prosperity of all countries."

Strengthening Cooperation Among Political Parties to Jointly Pursue the People’s Wellbeing – Keynote Address by Xi Jinping at the CCP and World Political Parties Summit,Xi Jinping,"Jul 6, 2021","The world today is undergoing profound transformation unseen in a century, amid which the trend of multi-polarity and economic globalization is experiencing a sea change, and countries are becoming increasingly intertwined, interdependent and interconnected. To cope with COVID-19, restart the economy, and safeguard world stability, the international community has made strenuous efforts. Political parties in various countries have also exhibited a strong sense of responsibility by making active explorations. Meanwhile, in some places, wars and conflicts are still raging, famine and diseases remain prevalent, and estrangement and confrontation grow even deeper. The call for a better life from people of all countries is becoming all the more loud and clear."
Strengthening Cooperation Among Political Parties to Jointly Pursue the People’s Wellbeing – Keynote Address by Xi Jinping at the CCP and World Political Parties Summit,Xi Jinping,"Jul 6, 2021","Today, human society has once again found itself at a historic crossroads. It is about hostile confrontation or mutual respect, reclusiveness and decoupling or openness and cooperation, zero-sum game or win-win results. The choice is in our hands and the responsibility falls on our shoulders."
Strengthening Cooperation Among Political Parties to Jointly Pursue the People’s Wellbeing – Keynote Address by Xi Jinping at the CCP and World Political Parties Summit,Xi Jinping,"Jul 6, 2021","The human race is an integral community and the planet Earth its homeland. In the face of common challenges, no person or country can remain insulated. The only way out is to work together in harmony with one accord. Political parties, as an important force behind human progress, need to set the right course forward and shoulder their historic responsibility to ensure the people’s wellbeing and pursue human progress. In my view, political parties need to work even harder on the following:"
Strengthening Cooperation Among Political Parties to Jointly Pursue the People’s Wellbeing – Keynote Address by Xi Jinping at the CCP and World Political Parties Summit,Xi Jinping,"Jul 6, 2021","First, we need to shoulder the responsibility to steer the course by seizing and shaping the shared future for mankind. People aspire to affluence and contentment. They yearn for fairness and justice. Great times call for grand architecture, and grand architecture calls for great vision. Viewed from the perspective of “my own country first”, the world is a cramped and crowded place perpetuated in fierce competition. Viewed from the perspective of “a global community with a shared future”, the world is a vast and broad place full of cooperation opportunities. We need to heed the voices of the people, follow the trend of the times and strengthen coordination and cooperation. By doing so, the interests of the people of one country will be kept in line with those of all others and humanity will move forward towards a shared future."
Strengthening Cooperation Among Political Parties to Jointly Pursue the People’s Wellbeing – Keynote Address by Xi Jinping at the CCP and World Political Parties Summit,Xi Jinping,"Jul 6, 2021","Second, we need to shoulder the responsibility to build consensus by upholding and promoting the common values of humanity. Despite differences among countries in history, culture, institution and level of development, their peoples do subscribe to the common values of humanity for peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom. With a strong sense of responsibility for the future of all mankind, we need to champion the common values of humanity, foster broad-minded tolerance toward the understanding of values by different civilizations, and respect the explorations of different peoples to turn values into reality. By doing so, the common values of humanity will be translated into the practice of individual countries to serve the interests of their own people in a concrete and realistic way."
Strengthening Cooperation Among Political Parties to Jointly Pursue the People’s Wellbeing – Keynote Address by Xi Jinping at the CCP and World Political Parties Summit,Xi Jinping,"Jul 6, 2021","Third, we need to shoulder the responsibility to promote development by bringing greater benefits to all peoples in a fairer manner. Development holds the key to the people’s wellbeing. On the road to the wellbeing of all mankind, no country or nation should be left behind. All countries and nations are equally entitled to development opportunities and rights to development. We need to face squarely up to major problems such as wealth gap and development divide, with particular attention and care given to underdeveloped countries and regions, and impoverished people so that hope prevails in every corner of the world. As an ancient Chinese adage goes, “Those who only seek comfort for themselves will ultimately be rejected and those who sacrifice their own interests for the success of others will be supported”. Development is the right of all countries, rather than an exclusive privilege of the few. We need to enable all countries to step up development cooperation, and see to it that the fruits of development are shared by all. We need to bring greater equity, higher efficiency and stronger synergy to global development, and jointly oppose the practice of seeking technology blockade and divide as well as decoupling. I believe that, in the final analysis, any political manipulation for the purpose of sabotaging the development of other countries and undercutting the livelihood of other peoples will receive little support and prove to be futile."
Strengthening Cooperation Among Political Parties to Jointly Pursue the People’s Wellbeing – Keynote Address by Xi Jinping at the CCP and World Political Parties Summit,Xi Jinping,"Jul 6, 2021","Fourth, we need to shoulder the responsibility to enhance cooperation by working together to address global risks and challenges. In the face of the on-going COVID-19, we need to continue with a science-based response approach and advocate solidarity and cooperation so as to close the “immunization gap”. We must oppose the practice of politicizing the pandemic or attaching a geographical label to the virus. We need to work together to build a global community of health for all. In the face of terrorism and other common enemies of mankind, we need to pursue security and stability through cooperation so as to tighten the security fences together. In the face of the fragile ecological environment, we need to respect Mother Nature, follow the laws of Nature and protect her so as to build a green homeland together. In the face of the severe challenges to human existence and development brought about by climate change, we need to be brave enough to take responsibilities and work as one to find a way of harmonious co-existence between man and Nature."
Strengthening Cooperation Among Political Parties to Jointly Pursue the People’s Wellbeing – Keynote Address by Xi Jinping at the CCP and World Political Parties Summit,Xi Jinping,"Jul 6, 2021","Fifth, we need to shoulder the responsibility to improve governance by enhancing our capacity to ensure the people’s wellbeing. There are different pathways toward wellbeing. People of all countries are entitled to choose their own development paths and institutional models. This, in itself, is what wellbeing entails. In the same vein, democracy is the right of all peoples, rather than an exclusive privilege of the few. There are multiple ways and means to realize democracy, instead of a single stereotype. The judgment on whether a country is democratic or not should be made by their people, not by the handful of others. To advance political democracy in a way that suits the national conditions of a country, we need to strengthen exchanges and mutual-learning, improve mechanisms for communication, be fully aware of the public opinion, put into place well-fledged institutions and enhance our governance capacity. By doing so, our capacity and efficacy to ensure the people’s wellbeing will be elevated continuously."

It is the unswerving goal of the CCP to run our own house well, ensure a happy life for the 1.4 billion plus Chinese people, and advance the lofty cause of promoting peace and development of all mankind. The CCP will continue to uphold the people-centered development philosophy, reflect upon the overarching issues of national rejuvenation and human progress in the greater context of time and space and lead the entire Chinese people in creating an even better tomorrow through ceaseless pursuit and in an enterprising spirit."

The CCP stands ready to work with world political parties to live our dreams and act to create a better future. Let us always be builders of world peace, advocates for global development, and guardians of the international order."
Strengthening Cooperation Among Political Parties to Jointly Pursue the People’s Wellbeing – Keynote Address by Xi Jinping at the CCP and World Political Parties Summit,Xi Jinping,"Jul 6, 2021","–The CCP will unite and lead the Chinese people in pressing ahead with the Chinese-style modernization to make new contributions to humanity’s search for ways to modernize. Proceeding from reality in all it does, the CCP has led the Chinese people in finding, through trial and error, the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. History and practice have proven and will continue to prove that this is not only the correct path that works, but also the sure path that pays off. We will unswervingly follow the path leading to a bright future to ensure that development is pursued for both our own good and the benefit of the world. There doesn’t exist a fixed model for the path to modernization, and the one that suits you well will serve you well. Cutting one’s feet to fit the shoes will lead nowhere. All efforts of individual countries to independently explore the path to modernization in light of their specific national conditions are worthy of respect. The CCP is willing to share with political parties of all countries modernization experience to enrich each other’s toolbox to modernization for better ensuring the wellbeing of their own people and all other peoples."
Strengthening Cooperation Among Political Parties to Jointly Pursue the People’s Wellbeing – Keynote Address by Xi Jinping at the CCP and World Political Parties Summit,Xi Jinping,"Jul 6, 2021","–The CCP will unite and lead the Chinese people in taking comprehensive steps to deepen reform and opening up to make new contributions to shared development and prosperity of all countries of the world. Currently, economic globalization, despite facing considerable headwinds, has in storage even greater impetus to move forward. On the whole, the impetus prevails over the headwinds and the trend towards opening-up and cooperation in all countries remains unchanged, and will not change. The CCP is ready to enhance communication with world political parties in steering economic globalization towards greater openness, inclusiveness, balance and win-win results. We stand ready to work with the international community to improve global connectivity and further promote high quality Belt and Road cooperation, so that more countries and peoples will be able to share the fruits of development."
Strengthening Cooperation Among Political Parties to Jointly Pursue the People’s Wellbeing – Keynote Address by Xi Jinping at the CCP and World Political Parties Summit,Xi Jinping,"Jul 6, 2021","—The CCP will shoulder its responsibilities as a major political party in a major country to make new contributions to improving the wellbeing of mankind. The eradication of poverty has been a common aspiration of people of all countries and an important objective that all political parties strive to achieve. Since the 18th National Congress of the CCP, all the 98.99 million rural residents living below the current poverty line in China have been lifted out of poverty, enabling China to meet the poverty reduction target set out in the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 10 years ahead of schedule. The CCP is willing to contribute more Chinese solutions and Chinese strength to the poverty reduction process worldwide. It will spare no effort to support international cooperation against COVID-19 and to enhance the accessibility and affordability of vaccines in developing countries. China will make extremely arduous efforts in delivering its promise of achieving carbon peak and carbon neutrality and contribute more to the global fight against climate change. China is going to host the 15th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, where parties will consult with one another on new strategies for biodiversity and embark on a new journey of global biodiversity governance."
Strengthening Cooperation Among Political Parties to Jointly Pursue the People’s Wellbeing – Keynote Address by Xi Jinping at the CCP and World Political Parties Summit,Xi Jinping,"Jul 6, 2021","–The CCP will actively improve global governance to make new contributions to humanity’s joint response to common challenges. Multilateralism has been the core concept of the current international system and order. The better multilateralism is practiced, the faster humanity’s common problems will be resolved. International rules should be based on universally-recognized norms rather than rules of the few. Cooperation among countries should aim at serving all mankind instead of seeking hegemony by way of group politics. We should stand opposed to the practice of unilateralism disguised as multilateralism and say no to hegemony and power politics. Upholding the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, China is of the view that matters concerning all shall be handled through joint consultation so that the international order and system will be more just and equitable. I wish to reiterate that China will always be a member of the developing world, and is committed to enhancing their representation and voice in the global governance system. China will never seek hegemony, expansion or sphere of influence. The CCP will work with political parties of all countries to promote state-to-state coordination and cooperation through party-to-party consultation and cooperation and bring into better play the due role of political parties in global governance."

Summary of the Party’s Historical Experience to Strengthen the Party’s Political Construction,Xi Jinping,"Aug 15, 2021","At the preparatory meeting of the Seventh Party Congress, Chairman Mao said a famous saying: “You must know that a team is often not very neat, so you must always call for alignment, to the left, to the right, and to the center. We must align with the benchmarks of the Central Committee and the benchmarks of the General Assembly. Alignment is the principle, deviations are real life. If there are deviations, call for alignment.” Chairman Mao said alignment is the principle, deviations are real life. This is a very profound truth. Just as in the military, well-trained troops often have to shout to stay in line. They have to shout every day and all the time. Of course, it is easier to align the team as a whole because it is physical. It is not so easy to align ideologically and politically. To frequently call for alignment is the law and experience of our Party’s efforts to strengthen its self-construction. Only by frequently calling for alignment and only when Party organizations at all levels are constantly calling for alignment can we be constantly vigilant and make corrections in a timely manner so that the whole Party can always maintain an organized and high-spirited state of endeavor. An important purpose of continuously bringing together leading cadres at Party schools for study and training is to help everyone align with the Party Central Committee. "

In the special period after the end of the “Cultural Revolution”, these Principles played a very important role in achieving political, ideological, organizational, and work style corrections and shifting the work center of the whole Party, in promoting unity within the Party, and in ensuring the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. "

For example, regarding the goals and basic principles of political life within the Party, regarding adhering to the Party’s political and ideological lines, regarding upholding collective leadership and opposing individual arbitrary decision-making, regarding maintaining the Party’s centrality and unity and strictly abiding by party discipline, regarding upholding Party spirit, regarding speaking the truth and practicing what we preach, regarding the promotion of intra-party democracy and correct handling of different opinions, regarding protecting the rights of Party members from infringement, regarding accepting the supervision of the Party and the masses and prohibiting the enjoyment of special privileges, and so on.

The comrades of the CCP Politburo must firmly establish political awareness, overall situation awareness, core awareness, and alignment awareness, adhere to taking the Party’s banner as our banner, the Party’s direction as our direction, and the Party’s will as our will, and be politically sensible people. For Party loyalty, the key is to have firm ideals and beliefs. The “Four Consciousnesses” are not empty slogans. They must not just be empty words, but must be put into action. Everyone must take the Party’s basic line as the fundamental line to follow, earnestly understand and correctly grasp the Party’s theories, lines, principles, and policies, better understand and grasp the Party’s basic line from the general trend of human development, the major changes in the world, and the general history of China’s development, and gain a deep understanding of why the basic line must be adhered to for an extended period. "

Summary of the Party’s Historical Experience to Strengthen the Party’s Political Construction,Xi Jinping,"Aug 15, 2021","It is the fundamental requirement of our Party as a Marxist party to speak politics with a clear-cut stand. Our Party has always attached importance to raising the political consciousness of Party members. In October 1927, Comrade Mao Zedong personally wrote the oath to join the Party: “sacrifice the individual, work hard for revolution, engage in class struggle, obey the organization, strictly keep secrets, never rebel against the party.” This is a vivid portrayal of the political consciousness of the Communist Party members. In summarizing our Party’s historical experience and especially the results achieved in strengthening the Party’s overall leadership and comprehensive and rigorous Party governance since the Eighteenth Party Congress, the Nineteenth Party Congress clearly put the Party’s political construction in the first place and emphasized that the Party’s political construction should take the leading role. "

Instead, he asked whether the army was heading south or north. This shows that even a cook in the Red Army understands that the question of direction is more important than what there is to eat.

The enemy cruelly cut off the tongue of the martyr Liu Renkan before he met his fate. He still dipped his feet in blood to write “Long live the success of the revolution.” Martyr Jiang Shanzhong left a bloody note, “Dying and going to the underworld will not turn back the water, it will protect the Communist Party for thousands of years.” The revolutionary martyrs gave their lives generously for their ideals and beliefs, relying on their faith. Today, there are fewer life and death tests of blood and fire like in the war years, but the great struggle is still continuing with new historical characteristics. We are facing a series of arduous tests with major challenges, major risks, major obstacles, and major contradictions. Without firm ideals and beliefs, you will lose your way in the complex environment of chaotically swirling clouds, retreat under the massive pressure of Mount Tai, and surrender under the bombardment of sugar-coated shells. We must draw on the mighty power of belief from our red DNA [communist heritage], strengthen the “Four Consciousnesses”, uphold the “Four Matters of  Confidence”, and practice the “Two Upholds.” We must consciously be firm believers and loyal practitioners of the lofty ideals of Communism and the common ideals of socialism with Chinese characteristics and truly become Marxist fighters who will never fail and never regret. "

Only with strong political capabilities can we consciously maintain a high degree of consistency with the Party Central Committee in ideological and political actions.

On this issue, there must be no confusion or vacillation! The practice of this fight against the COVID-19 epidemic has once again proved that the CCP is the most reliable backbone of the Chinese people in the face of storms and that China’s socialist system is the most powerful institutional guarantee against risks and challenges. Young cadres must adhere to one thing. You must do everything that is conducive to upholding the Party’s leadership and China’s socialist system and resolutely refrain from doing anything that is not conducive to upholding the Party’s leadership and China’s socialist system! You must continuously improve your political acuity and political discernment. When observing and analyzing a situation, you must first grasp the political factors and especially be able to see the essence through the phenomenon so that you can have a sharp eye, see things early, and act quickly. To improve your political capabilities, you must stand in awe of the Party’s political discipline and rules. You must consciously strengthen political training, strengthen political self-control, and always be an “understanding person” and an “honest person” in politics.

The Zunyi Conference has significance as a great turning point in the history of the Party. This Zunyi Conference was convened at the crucial historical juncture after the failure of the Fifth Counter-Encirclement Campaign and during the serious setback in the initial stage of the Long March. It firmly established Mao Zedong as leader of the Party Central Committee and the Red Army, and it began the establishment of the correct Marxist line, represented by Mao Zedong, as the leading line in the Party Central Committee. It began the formation of the first-generation central leading collective with Comrade Mao Zedong at its core and opened a new stage in which our Party independently and autonomously solved the real problems of the Chinese revolution. At this most critical juncture, it saved the Party, it saved the Red Army, and it saved the Chinese revolution. However, after the Zunyi Conference, all Party members continued to undergo a process of gaining a true and profound understanding of the great significance of upholding the authority of the Party Central Committee and its centralized leadership and of turning this awareness into conscious action. On the Long March, when our Party was in the greatest need of solidarity, Zhang Guotao assembled a personal army, established a separate central authority, and openly went down the road of splitting the Party and the Red Army. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, Wang Ming formed a faction within the Party and did things his own way without regard for the commands of the Party Central Committee, once again teaching all Party members with a negative example. To solve internal Party problems such as ideological divergence and sectarianism, our Party launched a large-scale rectification movement during the Yan’an period that resulted in the entire Party achieving unprecedented solidarity and unity and that laid a formidable ideological and political foundation for winning victory in the War of Resistance and for liberating the entire country. "

The Party’s solidarity and unity are now even more solid. At the same time, we need to be aware of the fact that there remain some Party members and cadres who lack adequate political consciousness and political acuity. They are not adept at observing and handling problems politically. They do not care about the “Great One of the Nations,” nor are they serious about political requirements, political norms, or political discipline. They are inattentive of the political dangers of various problems and careless when implementing the general policies of the Party Central Committee. They have yet to transform speaking politics from an external requirement into an internal initiative. Upholding the authority of the central committee and its centralized leadership cannot remain just words, but must be embodied in actions. It is necessary to educate and guide all Party members in extracting positive and negative historical experiences from Party history so that they resolutely conform to the Party Central Committee and continually improve their political judgment, political comprehension, and political execution. They should truly strengthen the “Four Consciousnesses” and reinforce the “Four Matters of Confidence” while carrying out the “Two Upholds.” In their thinking, politics, and actions, they should conscientiously maintain a high degree of consistency with the Party Central Committee to ensure that all Party members, from the highest to the lowest levels, are as though braided into a single rope, thinking and working with one heart and one mind. "

Party committees (Party groups) at all levels should conscientiously implement it. Today, I will especially emphasize three issues."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021",I. The Launch of Party History Learning and Education Is Highly Significant
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","Party history is the liveliest and most persuasive textbook. Our Party has always valued Party history learning and education. It has stressed the use of the Party’s course of struggle and great achievements in inspiring a fighting spirit and clearly defining directions. It has used the Party’s glorious traditions and excellent work style to reinforce beliefs and consolidate strength. It has used the Party’s practice and creations and its historical experience to impart wisdom and foster good character. Comrade Mao Zedong said: “If we don’t get Party history right, if we don’t figure out the historical road that the Party traveled, we won’t be able to do any better than we’re doing.” Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: “Every party and every country has its own history. It’s only by analyzing and summarizing it with an objective attitude of seeking truth from the facts that it proves beneficial.” Comrade Jiang Zemin emphasized: “One should study hard to learn Chinese history, particularly modern history and Party history, and, through such an effort, master and carry forward the fine tradition of the Chinese nation and the fine tradition of the Party.” Comrade Hu Jintao pointed out: “By launching various commemorative and educational activities, let us spur the vast number of young and middle-aged cadres to conduct further study of Party knowledge and Party history, gain an in-depth understanding of fine Party traditions and work styles, continually strengthen Party consciousness, and struggle for the Party’s cause with greater steadfastness and awareness.”"
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","Since the 18th Party Congress, the Party Central Committee has placed a high value on the learning of Party history. On different occasions, I have also put forward demands, which may be summed up in the following: First, our Party, having traversed a magnificent historical course of a hundred years, having ruled the world’s largest socialist country for more than 70 years, and having over 91 million Party members, has developed into the world’s largest Marxist ruling Party. For the CCP, which is determined to fight for the eternal wellbeing of the Chinese nation, the centenary signifies the prime of life. It should always stand at the forefront of current trends, stand on the frontline of the battle to tackle problems and overcome difficulties, stand amidst the overwhelming majority of the people, and remain forever in an undefeatable position. Second, history is the best teacher. The history of our Party constitutes the most moving chapters in China’s modern history. In the course of the people’s searching and struggling, history forged the CCP, and, by uniting and leading the people, our Party produced a new historical brilliance for long-standing Chinese civilization. Everything moves forward, but we can never forget the road we have traveled. No matter how far we travel or how brilliant the future we travel to, we still cannot forget our past journey. Nor can we forget why we set out. Third, to learn Party history is to uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics. It is a mandatory course for continuing to carry forward all the causes of the Party and the state. Not only is this course mandatory, but also it requires proper study. Fourth, Chinese revolutionary history is the best nutrient. A revival of this part of our great history makes it possible to receive a lively education in the Party’s original aspirations and mission, its character and purpose, its ideals and beliefs. We must inscribe this magnificent history in hearts and minds and pass on “red genes.” Fifth, it is necessary to study Party history, new China history, reform and opening up history, and socialist development history. The vast number of Party members should emphasize study of Party history to achieve love of the Party through historical knowledge and love of country through historical knowledge. In learning and comprehending, they should reinforce their ideals and beliefs; in exerting themselves to achieve something, they should fulfill the original aspirations and mission. Sixth, our Party’s history is the history of our Party’s mutual affinity with the people, of the joys and sorrows we’ve shared with the people, of our unified struggle with the people. We must live together and work together, always maintaining our ties of flesh and blood to the masses. Seventh, comprehensively disseminating Party history and fully bringing history’s roles of serving as a mirror to the present, of helping those in authority to govern, and of educating the people into play are among the most important of all the tasks of the Party and the state at present. Eighth, the purpose of looking back at history is not to seek comfort from our successes therein, even less is it to rest on our laurels or to avoid the difficulties currently confronting us or to seek excuses for our problems. Rather, it is to summarize historical experience, grasp historical patterns, and bolster the courage and strength we need to forge ahead in a pioneering spirit. Ninth, let us insist on using the materialist conception of history to understand history, insist on the ideological line of seeking truth from facts, distinguish between essentials and nonessentials, uphold truth, correct errors, carry forward experiences, and absorb lessons. All of these are consistent positions and attitudes of our Party concerning Party history. They embody our Party’s profound understanding of the importance and necessity of learning and employing Party history."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","Today, it is both right and absolutely necessary to launch Party history learning and education among all Party members at this important moment of celebrating the centennial of our Party’s birth and at this critical node of historical convergence of the “Two Centennial” objectives Our Party’s one hundred years have been a hundred years of making vows and keeping them in regard to our original aspirations and mission, a hundred of years of enduring the hardships of pioneering work and laying a foundation, a hundred years of creating brilliance and opening up the future. In a hundred years of continuing the struggle, the Party united and led the people in opening a great new road, in achieving great triumphs, in forging a great spirit, in accumulating precious experience, in creating astounding miracles in the Chinese nation’s development history and in the history of the progress of human society. Looking back at past struggles and looking forward to the struggles ahead, we must learn Party history and summarize it properly; we must make sure to pass on and carry forward the successful experiences of the Party."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","First, the launch of Party history learning and education among all Party members is the inevitable requirement for the noble undertaking of keeping true to our original aspirations and mission and advancing the history of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Ever since the day of its birth, our Party has been tightly linked to the future fate of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation. Following the Opium Wars, China gradually turned into a semi-colonial, semi-feudal society. Under invasion by foreign powers, frequently subject to the flames of war, our land occupied and carved up, and the people plunged into misery—in such a tragic situation did the Chinese people eke out a wretched existence. From that time on, to achieve national rejuvenation became the greatest dream of the Chinese nation. To free ourselves from a fate of slavery and humiliation, countless people with lofty ideals advanced in wave upon wave, each striving to find a way to save the country. The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement, the Westernization Movement, the Hundred Days’ Reform, the Boxer Rebellion, and the 1911 Revolution arose, one after another, but all ended in failure. None was able to alter the tragic fate of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation. The sound of the guns of the October Revolution gave China the gift of Marxism-Leninism. This was like a ray of sunlight in the darkness. To those Chinese advanced elements who were in a bitter search for a way to save both country and people, it pointed the way forward: The Chinese Communist Party was born. Beginning the moment it stepped onto the Chinese political stage, our Party upheld the positions, viewpoints, and methods of Marxism-Leninism and unswervingly sought the well-being of the Chinese people and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. From this moment forward, the Chinese people began spiritually to turn from passivity to activity, and the Chinese nation began the arduous yet irreversible progress towards its great rejuvenation."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","For a hundred years, no matter how circumstances and tasks changed, no matter what kind of stormy seas it encountered, our Party always firmly grasped the historical initiative, anchored itself to the objectives of struggle, and resolutely advanced in the correct direction. It took our Party nearly 30 years of uniting and leading the people to complete the New Democratic Revolution. It establish the new China, and the Chinese people thereupon stood up. Proceeding on a foundation of socialist revolution and construction, our Party united and led the people for more than 40 years in carrying out reform and opening up and achieved the great historical success of building a moderately prosperous society in an all-around way. We won the war on poverty on schedule and achieved the first of the centennial objectives. The next step is for our Party to unite and lead the people in basically achieving socialist modernization by 2035 and then, upon that foundation, struggle another 15 years to complete our transformation into a modernized socialist superpower by the middle of this century."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","Each generation has its responsibilities. The dawning of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is before us; our future is bright. At the same time, we must have a clear-headed recognition of the fact that the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is not something that can be achieved easily, by just making a lot of celebratory noises. We face both rare opportunities and forbidding challenges. At this critical moment, we cannot tolerate any stopping or delays, any “wait and see.” We must not forget our original aspirations and remain true to our mission; we must press on with our struggle to the very end."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","A Chinese ancient said: “Conscientiously research past affairs and carefully predict future affairs while referring to everyday affairs; then, if feasible, make a decision.” The purposes of launching Party history learning and education among all Party members are to educate and guide the entire Party in using history as a mirror and history as a means to clarify the mind, to understand the great contributions and fundamental successes that the Party achieved for the Chinese nation by uniting and leading the people, to know the historical position of contemporary China, to strengthen historical consciousness, to link the painful and brilliant past to the rapidly and continuously changing present to the glorious and grand future, to grasp hold of the correct direction in the midst of confusing circumstances, to foster courage and insight when faced with risks and challenges, to inspire the confidence and motivation to struggle for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, to firmly and persistently advance regardless of the conditions, and to initiate great historical undertakings that belong to our generation."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","Second, the launch of Party history learning and education among all Party members is the inevitable requirement for reinforcing faith and beliefs and for upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. Faith and beliefs are critically important at all times. Faith in communism and belief in socialism with Chinese characteristics are the political soul of Communist Party members. They are the spiritual support that enables Communist Party members to bear any trial. In the new era, the most important things for reinforcing faith and belief are to reinforce confidence in the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, confidence in its theory, confidence in its system, and confidence in its culture. The hundred-year struggle and great achievements of the Party are the firmest foundation upon which we strengthen the “Four Confidences.”"
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","Following a hundred years of struggle, our Party has united and led the people in a country with a millennia-old history of feudal society to the realization of the broadest kind of people’s democracy. The people truly have become masters of their country, their society, and their own fate. On a foundation of economic poverty and cultural blankness, we created a miracle of rapid economic and social development. It took us a few decades to complete the historical course of industrialization that took the developed nations centuries to complete. We have leaped forward to being the world’s second largest economy. Our comprehensive national power, scientific and technological strength, national defense capabilities, cultural influence, and international influence have risen significantly. From lacking the basic necessities of life, our people have come to enjoy an all-around, moderate prosperity. In an overall sense, they have thoroughly rid themselves of absolute poverty, becoming the world’s most populous middle-income country. Our country has maintained social harmony and stability for a long time, and our people live and work in peace and contentment. Our country has become one of the most secure countries as recognized by the international community. The great struggle against the COVID-19 pandemic put on full display the striking superiority of the Party’s leadership and our country’s socialist system. It provided a tremendous boost to the confidence and belief of people of all ethnic groups throughout the Party and the country. If one should ask which political party, which country, and which nationality have self-confidence in today’s world, the answer would have to be: the CCP, the PRC, and the Chinese nation have the most reason to have self-confidence!"
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","The launch of Party history learning and education among all Party members aims to educate and guide all Party members towards a profound understanding of the difficulty involved in establishing red political power, the difficulty involved in bring about the new China, and the difficulty involved in bringing about socialism with Chinese characteristics and towards a profound understanding of why the CCP is capable, why Marxism is feasible, and why socialism with Chinese characteristics is good. It aims to continually reinforce the “Four Matters of Confidence,” to continually strengthen historical focus, and to strengthen the aspirations, moral integrity, and confidence entailed in being Chinese."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","Third, the launch of Party history learning and education among all Party members is an inevitable requirement for advancing the Party’s self-revolution and for forever preserving the Party’s vitality. The courage to carry out self-revolution is our Party’s most distinctive characteristic. It is also our Party’s greatest advantage. A hundred years of adversity, a hundred years of drawing lessons from intense struggles. From the initial 50-odd members, our Party was able to grow to the more than 91 million members of today. It has conquered difficulty after difficulty and has won victory after victory. The key lies in us always insisting that the Party manage itself, that it engage in strict, unrelenting Party self-governance in all respects, and that it thoroughly carry out self-revolution while advancing social revolution."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","The launch of centralized learning and education among all Party members is an important way in which the Party advances self-revolution; it is also an important experience. Since the reform and opening up, we have forcefully advanced the great new project of Party building by launching the consolidation of the Party organization and through “Three Emphases” education, the campaign to maintain the advanced nature of Party members, the campaign for the study and practice of a scientific development outlook, and so on. Since the 18th Party Congress, we have successively organized and launched the mass line education and practice campaign, the “Three Stricts, Three Honests” education campaign, the “Two Studies, One Action” education campaign, and “Staying True to Our Original Aspirations and Founding Mission”-themed education. The Party’s creativity, cohesiveness, and battle effectiveness have improved significantly, and the Party’s self-purifying, self-perfecting, self-updating, and self-enhancing capabilities have continually strengthened."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","Currently, in comparison to the great socialist revolution that is advancing towards a modernized socialist superpower, Party building still suffers from some mismatches and maladjustments. There are some potentially very dangerous and destructive problems that weaken the Party’s advanced nature and harm the Party’s purity. In particular, there are some recurring and intractable problems relating to Party conduct and government integrity, which will rebound and nullify our previous efforts if we become in the least inattentive. The launch of Party history learning and education among all Party members aims to educate and guide all Party members at this critical moment when they set out on a new journey to continue carrying forward a thorough revolutionary spirit, to uphold strict Party self-governance in all respects and at all times on their way, to maintain the clear-mindedness of one “going on a journey to take an imperial examination,” and to use the Party’s self-revolution in a new era to show the way to a new great socialist revolution."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021",II. The Key Points of Launching Party History Learning and Education Should Be Highlighted
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","The Notice printed and issued by the Party Central Committee makes clear demands regarding this learning and education work, which, in summary, are the following: study history to gain insights, study history to increase confidence, study history to admire the virtuous, study history to invigorate action, and educate and guide all Party comrades to study Party history, become ideologically aware, do practical things, and open up new prospects."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","First, increase awareness of the great power of thought, and strengthen the use of the Party’s innovative theories to arm the political consciousness of all Party members. Thought is power. If a nation is to progress at the forefront of an era, there is not a single moment in which it can do without theoretical thinking; there is not a single moment in which it does not need to be guided by thought. At the most critical moment in modern China, CCP members found Marxism-Leninism and insisted on combining Marxism-Leninism with Chinese realities. They used the power of Marxist-Leninist truth to vitalize the great civilization created by the Chinese nation over the course of millennia, causing Chinese civilization to once again erupt with great spiritual force. Practice proves that Marxism is the powerful ideological weapon whereby we understand the world, grasp patterns, pursue truth, and transform the world. It is the guiding ideology which our Party and state must always follow."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","The vitality of theory lies in innovation. Marxism profoundly changed China, and China enormously enriched Marxism. For a hundred years, our Party has upheld the unity of liberation thought and seeking truth from facts, as well as the unities of targeted treatments and systemic health and of cultural inheritance and innovation. The continual breaking of new Marxist ground produced Mao Zedong Thought, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the important thought of the “Three Represents,” and the Scientific Outlook on Development. It produced Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and provides scientific theoretical guidance for developing undertakings of the Party and the people. Our Party’s history is a history of continually advancing the Sinification of Marxism. It is a history of continually advancing theoretical innovation, of carrying out theoretical creation."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","All Party members need to be educated and guided to grasp, from the extraordinary historical course traveled by the Party, how Marxism has profoundly changed China and the world, to comprehend the power of Marxism as both truth and practice, and to deepen their understanding of the theoretical quality that Sinified Marxism has of being both a continuous line and advancing with the times. In particular, in light of the historical successes achieved in undertakings of the Party and the state since the 18th Party Congress and the process whereby historical changes have occurred, they need to conduct in-depth study to understand the innovative theories of the Party in a new era and to unceasingly use the latest achievements of the Party’s innovative theories to arm their minds, guide their practice, and push forward with their work."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","Second, gain a further grasp of history’s development pattern and general trend, while always having the historical initiative for the development of undertakings of the Party and the state. Historical development has its pattern, but people are not completely passive within that pattern. So long as we take hold of the pattern and general trend of historical development, seize opportunities for historical transformation, act in harmony with the trend, and exert ourselves towards achievement, we can achieve even greater progress. More than 170 years ago, Marx and Engels scientifically revealed the historical pattern whereby socialism necessarily replaces capitalism. This is an irreversible, overall trend in the development of human societies, but it must pass through a long historical process. In this process, we should base our efforts on reality, properly grasp the general historical trend of each stage, and properly deal with the matters at hand."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","During its one hundred years of struggle, our Party has always used the basic principles of Marxism to analyze and grasp general historical trends and to correctly handle relations between China and the world so that we can adeptly seize and use to our advantage all kinds of historical opportunities. The birth of our Party was an outcome in keeping with the general trend of world development. The victory of the October Revolution and the rise of socialism constituted the general trend of world events at the time. Our Party arose from this general trend of world events and advanced at the forefront of the times. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, our Party, taking the general trend of the World Anti-Fascist War and the Chinese people’s fervent desire to be saved from Japanese aggression as its starting point, brought about the united Chinese front against Japanese aggression and ultimately united and led the people to win the great victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. The founding and consolidation of the People’s Republic of China were also products that conformed to the tide of the times. At the time, socialism was developing by leaps and bounds. Liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America were like a rising storm, and there was a general atmosphere of “the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind.” It was while bathed in this East Wind that the new China was born and was able to stand firmly. The major decision to proceed with the reform and opening up was also based on our Party’s profound insight into the trend of the times. The world economy and science and technology were then undergoing rapid development. The gap between China’s development and the international advanced level had noticeably expanded. Comrade Deng Xiapoing said: “We must keep abreast of the times; that is the purpose of our reform.” Our Party made a scientific assessment of the general trend of world events and, resolving to transfer the work centers of the Party and the state, it pressed forward with an indomitable spirit by drawing open the great historical curtain to initiate the reform and opening up."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","“A man may have wisdom, but that is not as good as seizing a favorable opportunity.” One must know history to see far, and one must understand history to go far. All Party members need to be educated and guided so that they can do the following: carry in their hearts the overall strategy of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese people and the great changes in the world unseen in a century, establish a macro-historical outlook, analyze and investigate the long river of history, the tide of the times, and global storms to discover the evolutionary mechanisms and historical patterns therein, put forward response strategies, and make work more systematic, forward-looking, and creative."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","Third, further deepen understanding of the Party’s nature and purpose; always maintain the distinct coloring of a Marxist political party. Our Party comes from the people. The roots and blood of our Party are among the people. It was born for the people and arose because of the people. It is always together with the people and struggles for the people’s interests. The people are the start and end points for establishing the Party, prospering the Party, and strengthening the Party."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","Our Party’s one hundred-year history is the history of putting our original aspirations and mission into practice. It is the history of the Party becoming of one mind with the people, of breathing as one with the people, and of sharing their fate. After the failure of the Great Revolution, the majority of the more than 300,000 revolutionaries who had sacrificed themselves became the masses who followed our Party and took part in revolutionary activity. During the period of the Red Army, the masses were an impregnable wall for the Party and the People’s Army. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, our Party broadly mobilized the masses, causing the Japanese invaders to sink into the boundless ocean of a people’s war. The victory of the Huaihai Campaign relied on small carts pushed by the common people, and the victory of the Yangtze River Crossing Campaign relied on small boats rowed by the common people. The achievements of the socialist revolution and construction were the work of the masses, and hundreds of millions of the masses were the protagonists in the great historical drama of the reform and opening up. History provides ample proof that the country is the people and that the people are the country. The support or disapproval of the people has a direct bearing on the survival of the Party. If it wins the trust of the people and gains the people’s support, the Party can overcome any difficulty and can be victorious wherever it goes. If not, we will not succeed in anything and will even go down the road to failure and decay."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","The constitution of our Party makes its purpose crystal-clear from the very beginning: The CCP is the vanguard of the Chinese working class and is, at the same time, the vanguard of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation. The Party constitution also clearly requires that the Party serve the people wholeheartedly and shall at all times put the interests of the masses first; that it shall share the masses’ joys and sorrows and maintain the closest of ties with them. It is thus incumbent upon us to insist on the consistency between respecting social development patterns and respecting the people’s status as the main historical entity, the consistency between fighting for lofty ideals and seeking benefits on behalf of the broad masses of the people, and on the consistency between completing every Party task and achieving the people’s interests. We will never separate from the masses, but will share all our good fortune with the masses and bear the same hardships they do. If we have salt, we’ll share it; if we don’t, we’ll both do without. All Party members should be educated and guided to understand the Party’s nature and purpose, to uphold the concept that everything is both for the people and dependent upon the people, to always put the people foremost in their minds and make the people’s yearning for a high standard of living the goal of their struggle, to strive to ensure that the gains of reform and development provide even more benefit to all the people in an even fairer way, to push for even more obvious, substantive progress towards shared prosperity, and to gather together the 1.4 billion Chinese people in a boundless force for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","Fourth, further summarize the Party’s historical experience; continually enhance its ability to cope with risks and challenges. An important aspect of the step-by-step progress our Party has made is the continual summarizing of experiences and improvement of skills. We have continually improved our ability to cope with risks and take on challenges, to emerge safely from dangerous situations. The Party’s experiences didn’t just drop from the heavens, nor were they copied from a book. Rather, the experiences accumulated over a long period of groping about by the Party as it underwent many hardships—experiences brimming with successes and failures and gains and losses, laden with blood and sweat, and filled with wisdom, boldness, and perseverance."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","Our national development currently faces unprecedented risks and challenges. These are domestic and international; they are found in the fields of politics, economics, culture, and society and arise from the natural world. Some are traditional, and others non-traditional. There are also “black swans” and “gray rhinos” which might unexpectedly arrive. We need to more effectively deal with all kinds of foreseeable and difficult-to-foresee risks and challenges on the road ahead. We must obtain enlightenment from history and extract from our historical experience magic weapons that give us victory over our enemies. Summarizing the experiences of the revolutionary struggle back then, Comrade Mao Zedong took the concepts of unified front, armed struggle, and Party building and gave them the general designation of the “Three Magic Weapons” that give victory over enemies. This played an important role in the victory of the New Democratic Revolution, and it continues to play an important role to this day. When I celebrated the 95th anniversary of the Party founding, the 40th anniversary of the reform and opening up, and the 70th anniversary of the founding of the new China, and on other important occasions, I summarized the Party’s historical experience from different angles. We should seize this important Party centenary node and, taking the great struggle that has many new historical characteristics as our starting point, summarize and make use of the Party’s rich experience in dealing with risks and challenges during different historical periods to carry out ideological preparations and work preparations for dealing with changes in the external environment over a longer period of time. We should continually strengthen consciousness of struggle, enrich the experience of struggle, and improve the ability to struggle. We should continually improve governance abilities and standards. With our eyes fixed on the worst aspects, let us carry out the most complete preparations and, striving in a good direction, aim to win the best results."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","A fortress is most easily destroyed from within. In a certain sense, the greatest risks that our Party has faced since its founding are internal deterioration, change of color, and change of flavor—the loss of the political coloring proper to a Marxist political party and the loss of the support of the overwhelming majority of the people as a result of deviating from the Party’s purpose. The Party’s hundred-year history is also the history of our Party’s unceasing preservation of the Party’s advanced nature and purity and the continual guarding against the dangers of disintegration and corruption. All Party members should be educated and guided to summarize lessons from historical experience and thereby to do the following: keep their eyes on solving the practical problems involved in Party building, continually raise leadership and administrative standards and strengthen the abilities needed to fight corruption, forestall moral degeneration, and guard against risk. In this way, we can ensure that our Party always advances at the forefront of the times in the midst of a historical process of profound changes in the global situation, that it always becomes the backbone for the people throughout the country in the historical process of coping with various domestic and foreign risks and challenges, and that it always becomes the strong leadership core in the historical process of upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","Fifth, further carry forward the revolutionary spirit, and always maintain an upbeat spirit in arduous struggle. “The long road of life on earth is both rough and smooth.” No other political party on earth has encountered as many difficulties as ours has, and none has undergone as many life-and-death tests or made as many heroic sacrifices. For a hundred years, in the course of dealing with all kinds of difficulties and challenges, our Party has forged a style and character of not fearing powerful foes, of not being afraid of risk, of daring to struggle, and of having the courage to be victorious. These are our Party’s most distinctive qualities and characteristics. Over the course of a hundred years of extraordinary struggle, one generation after another of CCP members has tenaciously fought and unrelentingly struggled. There arose a great number of revolutionary martyrs unafraid of death, a great number of heroes engaged in tenacious struggle, and a great number of selflessly dedicated advanced role models. They gave rise to the spirit of Jinggangshan, the spirit of the Long March, the spirit of the Zunyi Conference, the spirit of Yan’an, the spirit of Xibaipo, the spirit of Hongyan, the spirit of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the spirit of “Two Bombs, One Satellite,” the spirit of the special zones, the spirit of fighting the floods, the spirit of earthquake relief, the spirit of fighting the pandemic, and other manifestations of a great spirit. Thus, they established a spiritual pedigree of CCP members. The reason our Party is in the prime of life even after a hundred years and continues to thrive even after experiencing countless hardships is its reliance on a powerful spirit of revolution and unyielding struggle."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","These precious spiritual treasures transcend space and time and become more vital as time goes by. They manifest the firm beliefs, fundamental purposes, and excellent work style of the Party in concentrated form. They embody arduous struggle, sacrificial dedication, and a pioneering spirit, which constitute the great character of CCP members. They have penetrated deeply into the veins of our Party, country, nation, and people, providing abundant nourishment for establishing the Party, prospering the Party, and strengthening the Party."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","At the same time, we must have a sober awareness of the fact that, with our Party long in power, it will be easy for Party members to develop a slack attitude arising from a long period of peace. Some members feel that the time has already come to draw a long breath, put up their feet, and live as untroubled, “peaceful” officials. Some, feeling that the “boat has arrived at the pier and the train is in the station,” want to rest on their laurels and drift along as mediocre and idle administrators. Some make lots of plans for themselves, worrying about their own gains and losses. They don’t dare take on burdens, but hunger after fame and fortune and enjoyments. Some are accustomed to acting as “megaphones” or “transfer stations.” When they meet with a difficulty, they walk around it or pass it up the chain. They lack the drive and fighting spirit to tackle and overcome problems. I’ve repeatedly emphasized the need to carry forward the spirit of carrying the revolution through to the end. I’ve emphasized the need to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the old generation of revolutionaries, who thought “It is better to chase the poor enemy while we are strong than to emulate the hegemon for the sake of empty fame” and to carry forward the fighting spirit among Party members of “bitter sacrifice strengthens bold resolve, which dares to make sun and moon shine in new skies.” This is something I have deeply considered. Let everyone ponder the fact that socialist modernization was achieved in a country such as ours, having a population a population of 1.4 billion. How great this is! How amazing! All Party members need to be educated and guided so that they vigorously carry forward the red tradition and pass on red genes; so that they continue to have the spiritual blood of Community Party members, always maintaining the fearless fighting spirit of revolutionaries; so that they summon up the spiritual energy to stride forward on new journeys and go forward bravely into a new era."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","Sixth, further strengthen the Party’s solidarity and centralized unity; ensure that all Party members step forward in unison. Taking a clear political stand and ensuring that the Party is unified and centralized are both the very life of the Party and are critical to our Party’s becoming a great, century-old Party and accomplishing the great achievements of a century. Practice demonstrates that, so long as all the Party is unified into a “piece of hard steel,” it can unify people of all ethnicities in the country to form a single-minded, invincible, boundless force and defeat every powerful enemy and overcome all hardships."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","Ensuring that all Party members follow the central government and upholding the authority of the Party Central Committee and its centralized leadership are the primary tasks of the political work of the Party; we must persevere in them. The Zunyi Conference has significance as a great turning point in the history of the Party. This Zunyi Conference was convened at the crucial historical juncture after the failure of the Fifth Counter-Encirclement Campaign and during the serious setback in the initial stage of the Long March. It firmly established Mao Zedong as leader of the Party Central Committee and the Red Army, and it began the establishment of the correct Marxist line, represented by Mao Zedong, as the leading line in the Party Central Committee. It began the formation of the first-generation central leading collective with Comrade Mao Zedong at its core and opened a new stage in which our Party independently and autonomously solved the real problems of the Chinese revolution. At this most critical juncture, it saved the Party, it saved the Red Army, and it saved the Chinese revolution. However, after the Zunyi Conference, all Party members continued to undergo a process of gaining a true and profound understanding of the great significance of upholding the authority of the Party Central Committee and its centralized leadership and of turning this awareness into conscious action. On the Long March, when our Party was in the greatest need of solidarity, Zhang Guotao assembled a personal army, established a separate central authority, and openly went down the road of splitting the Party and the Red Army. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, Wang Ming formed a faction within the Party and did things his own way without regard for the commands of the Party Central Committee, once again teaching all Party members with a negative example. To solve internal Party problems such as ideological divergence and sectarianism, our Party launched a large-scale rectification movement during the Yan’an period that resulted in the entire Party achieving unprecedented solidarity and unity and that laid a formidable ideological and political foundation for winning victory in the War of Resistance and for liberating the entire country."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","“Raise the main rope, and ten thousand eyes will open.” Since the 18th Party Congress, we have gone all out to push forward the political work of the Party and to strengthen all institutions that uphold the authority of the central committee and its centralized leadership. The Party’s solidarity and unity are now even more solid. At the same time, we need to be aware of the fact that there remain some Party members and cadres who lack adequate political consciousness and political acuity. They are not adept at observing and handling problems politically. They do not care about the “Great One of the Nations,” nor are they serious about political requirements, political norms, or political discipline. They are inattentive of the political dangers of various problems and careless when implementing the general policies of the Party Central Committee. They have yet transform politics from an external requirement into an internal initiative. Upholding the authority of the central committee and its centralized leadership cannot remain just words, but must be embodied in actions. It is necessary to educate and guide all Party members in extracting positive and negative historical experiences from Party history so that they resolutely conform to the Party Central Committee and continually improve their political judgment, political comprehension, and political execution. They should truly strengthen the “Four Consciousnesses” and reinforce the “Four Matters of Confidence” while carrying out the “Two Upholds.” In their thinking, politics, and actions, they should conscientiously maintain a high degree of consistency with the Party Central Committee to ensure that all Party members, from the highest to the lowest levels, are as though braided into a single rope, thinking and working with one heart and one mind."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","III. In Launching Party History Learning and Education Among All Party Members, Let Us Strive for Practical Results"
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","The launch of Party history learning and education among all Party members is an important event in the political life of the Party. All Party members should give this matter their close attention. They should improve their ideological stance, base themselves on reality, preserve our cultural inheritance while innovating, and complete every learning and education task in accordance with high standards and high quality. I will re-emphasize a few points concerning the proper implementation of this learning and education."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","First, organizational leadership should be strengthened. Party committees (Party groups) at all levels should shoulder their primary responsibilities. Important leading comrades should personally take charge and take the lead in setting an example. Establish leading institutions, and truly put the deployments and requirements of the Party Central into actual effect. The leadership of the Party History Learning and Education Leading Small Groups should be strengthened. Provincial, regional, and municipal Party committees and the Party groups (Party committees) for departments in charge of industries and systems should strengthen supervision, guidance, and inspection over their subordinate regions, departments, and units. In-depth study of Party history by all Party members is an important way to strengthen Party consciousness and Party membership consciousness. Regardless of the position they occupy, all Party members and cadres should quiet their minds and, with total dedication, conscientiously study this history and think about it deeply. They should make their learning give rise to thought, to understanding, and to benefits."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","Second, it is necessary to establish a correct outlook on Party history. The materialist historical outlook is the fundamental method whereby we Communist Party members understand history. If one’s historical outlook is wrong, one will not simply be unable to achieve the objective of learning and education, but will in fact act contrary to the objective and form misconceptions. At present, there are some erroneous tendencies that should cause us to become vigilant. Some people have exaggerated mistakes and complications in Party history and, wantonly blackening and distorting Party history, have attacked the Party’s leadership. Some have painstakingly tied Party events to actual problems and maliciously hyped them. Others, believing in unofficial history instead of official history, vulgarize Party history and make it into material for entertainment. They are keen to spread gossip and rumors and talk enthusiastically about them to illegal foreign publications, and so on and so forth. While insisting on taking our Party’s two resolutions on historical questions and the relevant spirit of the Party Central Committee as the basis, let us accurately grasp the theme, main line, main current, and essence of Party historical development. We should correctly understand and scientifically evaluate important events, conferences, and personages in Party history. Some important issues in Party history should be treated in terms of seeking truth from facts. We cannot avoid the mistakes and complications because of the successes, nor can we deny the successes because of the mistakes and complications found in our investigations. We must take a clear political stand against historical nihilism, strengthen ideological guidance and theoretical analysis, and clear up hazy and one-sided understandings in order to more effectively carry out radical reform and targeted treatments for systemic health."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","Third, efforts should be made to do practical things for the masses and solve their problems. Learning Party history should be combined with summarization of experiences, careful observation of reality, and promotion of work. Transform the results of learning into work motivation and results; prevent learning and work from becoming “two skins.” This Party history learning and education should be combined with solving real problems. Properly launch the practical activities of “I do practical things for the masses.” Public servant consciousness and heartfelt feelings for the people need to be strengthened. First of all, jobs should be established to serve the people, and Party members should properly perform their role as vanguard models. They should also begin with those masses whose difficulties are the greatest, first seize hold of those problems that are most prominent, take the most practical interests as the starting point, and truly solve grassroots difficulties and those problems that trouble the masses. Doing practical things is not simply providing funds and material assistance or doing something merely for show. Basing oneself in the here and now, one should solve concrete problems, those “misfortunes that are viewed with anxiety” by the masses. But it is also necessary, in consideration of the long term, to perfect institutional mechanisms for solving livelihood problems and thereby to boost the people’s sense of fulfillment, happiness, and security. People in the old revolutionary bases made great sacrifices and contributions for the Party and the people. We need to build up the old revolutionary bases and take proper care of the descendants of the heroes and martyrs so that they can live happier lives."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","Fourth, it is necessary to emphasize innovation in method and approach. Party history learning and education have their own characteristics and patterns. Let us carry forward the excellent Marxist learning style, uphold sector-specific guidance, clearly define learning requirements and learning tasks, advance innovation in the areas of content, form, and method, and continually strengthen relevance and effectiveness. With the focus on leading cadres at the county level and above, we should insist on combining centralized learning and autonomous learning, insist on combining prescribed actions and optional actions, and launch learning and education that have distinct characteristics and diverse forms. We should take control of special-topic learning, special-topic Party classes, special-topic democratic life meetings, and special-topic training. Let us carefully organize propaganda teams to launch special-topic talks, and, making proper use of the Party’s red resources, give cadres and the masses personal experiences of its arduous historical course, enormous changes, and brilliant successes. We should launch broad, society-wide propaganda and education consisting of Party history, new China history, reform and opening up history, and socialist development history. Let us popularize the knowledge of Party history and promote Party history learning and education so that it penetrates deep among the masses, the grassroots, and the minds of the people. We need to encourage the creation of literary and artistic works, particularly for cinema and television, with Party history themes. We also should carefully organize the publishing and distribution of Party history-themed publications and bring the important role of the internet into play in Party history propaganda. Let us take control of youth learning and education, and make an effort to properly tell stories of the Party, the revolution, and its heroes so as to deeply cultivate love of Party, country, and socialism and pass on red genes and the torch of the revolution to the next generation."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","Let us resolutely overcome formalism and bureaucratism, and be sure to reduce burdens on community-level officials. Let us prevent half-hearted completion of tasks and the occurrence of such phenomena as “people who are physically present, but whose minds are elsewhere.” Let us also prevent simply going by the book or rambling on just to gain attention. We need to prevent superficiality and fragmentation. Studying and telling Party history can’t just stop at the level of telling or listening to a story. Rather, story-telling should be used to lead the vast number of Party members towards a deeper understanding and grasp of Party history and towards a deeper theoretical understanding and knowledge of Party history."
Talk Given at the Party History Learning and Education Mobilization Meeting ,Xi Jinping,"Feb 20, 2021","At present, the prevention and control of the pandemic in our country remains complex, and the related economic and social development tasks are onerous. While persisting in overall planning that takes all aspects into consideration, we must tightly integrate Party history learning and education with the central work of the Party and the state, with overall planning for prevention and control of the pandemic and economic and social development, and with mobilizing the masses to create a high standard of living. With an upbeat attitude, let us do our best to begin a new journey of building a modernized socialist country in an all-around way, and, with outstanding achievements, let us greet the centenary of the Party founding!"
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,Xi Jinping,"May 15, 2022","This is part of General Secretary Xi Jinping’s speech at the Central Economic Work Conference on December 8, 2021."
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,Xi Jinping,"May 15, 2022","As we enter into a new stage of development, China’s internal and external environment for development has undergone profound changes, and there are many new major problems that need to be correctly understood and grasped. Here, I focus on a few issues."
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,Xi Jinping,"May 15, 2022","The first issue: we must correctly understand and grasp the strategic goals and practical ways to achieve common prosperity. “The wealthy people of a country must care about enriching the common people.” The creation and distribution of wealth is a major issue faced by all countries. For some western countries, as social wealth has continued to grow so has wealth disparity and polarization. In some Latin American countries, income is not high, but the distribution gap in wealth is very large. Under China’s socialist system, it is not only necessary to continuously liberate and develop social productive forces, and to continuously create and accumulate social wealth, but also to prevent polarization, and to earnestly promote the all-around development of human beings and the common prosperity of all people to achieve more obvious and substantial progress. In the past, we were egalitarian at a low-income level. After the reform and opening up, some regions and some people became rich first, and the income gap gradually widened. The improper accumulation of some wealth has brought risks and challenges to the healthy operation of the economy and society."
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,Xi Jinping,"May 15, 2022","Common prosperity is the essential requirement of socialism with Chinese characteristics. What should the path to common prosperity look like? We are currently exploring this. To achieve the goal of common prosperity, we must first make the “cake” bigger and better through the joint efforts of the people of the whole country, and then correctly handle the relationship between growth and distribution through reasonable institutional arrangements, so as to divide the “cake” well. This is a long-term historical process. We must create conditions, improve systems, and steadily move towards this goal."
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,Xi Jinping,"May 15, 2022","It is necessary to strengthen employment as a priority in order to promote high-quality development. Employment is the foundation of people’s livelihood. Employment is the driving force of economic growth, so it is important to continuously promote the expansion of employment and the improvement of the quality of employment. It is necessary to support the development of small, medium and micro enterprises and give full play to their role as a channel for employers. It is necessary to learn from the lessons of some Western countries’ economic transitions from the “real to the virtual,” 1 continue to expand the real economy, and create more high-quality jobs. It is necessary to increase investment in human capital, improve the quality of education, strengthen vocational education and skills training, improve the quality of workers, better meet the needs of high-quality development, and effectively prevent large-scale unemployment risks."
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,Xi Jinping,"May 15, 2022","It is important that everyone is performing their assigned function and role. It is necessary to properly handle the relationship between efficiency and fairness, and build basic institutional arrangements for primary distribution, redistribution, and coordination of three distributions. We must adhere to the principle of distribution according to work, increase the proportion of labor remuneration in the initial distribution, and improve the policy of distribution according to different factors. It is necessary to give full play to the role of redistribution, and increase the adjustment of taxation, social security, transfer payments, etc., and improve the accuracy of record keeping. It is necessary to give full play to the role of the Third Distribution Theory, 2 and guide and support willing and capable enterprises and social groups to actively participate in public welfare and charitable undertakings without engaging in “forced donations” in the form of moral kidnapping."
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,Xi Jinping,"May 15, 2022","It is necessary to improve the public service policy system. To promote common prosperity, we must not engage in “welfare”. Some Latin American countries in the past have engaged in populism, and welfare in these countries has raised a group of “lazy people” with unearned incomes. As a result, the countries’ financial systems were overwhelmed and fell into the “middle-income trap” 3, that they were unable to extricate themselves from for a long time. Welfare benefits cannot decrease if they go up, and “Welfare-ism” that exceeds one’s ability is unsustainable, and it will inevitably bring about serious economic and political problems! We must adhere to doing our best and do what we can, focusing on improving the level of public services, accurately providing basic public services in the fields of education, medical care, elderly care, housing and other areas that the people are most concerned about, and taking care of the most basic needs of life for people in need, without raising the expectation of welfare to cover all expenses, or providing empty promises."
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,Xi Jinping,"May 15, 2022","The second issue: correctly understand and grasp the characteristics and behavioral laws of capital. Marx and Engels did not envisage that a market economy could be developed under socialist conditions, and of course they could not foresee how socialist countries would treat capital. Although Lenin and Stalin led the socialist construction of the Soviet Union, at that time the Soviet Union implemented a highly centralized planned economic system and basically did not encounter large-scale capital problems. To engage in a socialist market economy is a great creation of our party. Since it is a socialist market economy, it will inevitably produce various forms of capital. Although there are many differences between capital in capitalist society and capital in socialist society, capital is all about chasing profits. “The key to uniting the people is to manage their wealth appropriately 4. We should explore how to play the positive role of capital under the conditions of a socialist market economy, while effectively controlling the negative role of capital. In recent years, due to lack of awareness and lack of supervision, capital has expanded in a disorderly way, manipulated arbitrarily, and made huge profits in some areas of our country. This requires regulating the behavior of capital, seeking advantages and avoiding disadvantages, not allowing “capital predators” to act recklessly, but also giving full play to the function of capital as a factor of production. This is a major political and economic issue that cannot be avoided."
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,Xi Jinping,"May 15, 2022","In practical work, the following points should be paid attention to. To set “traffic lights” for capital. “Traffic lights” apply to all means of transportation on the road, and the same is true for capital. All types of capital cannot run amok. To prevent the savage growth of some capital, we must fight against monopoly, profiteering, sky-high prices, malicious hype, and unfair competition. Effective supervision of capital should be strengthened in accordance with the law. The socialist market economy is an economy ruled by law, and capital activities must be carried out in accordance with the law. To curb the disorderly expansion of capital, it is not the absence of capital, but the orderly development of capital. Relevant laws and regulations that are not perfect should be improved as soon as possible, and those with existing laws and regulations should be strictly enforced and supervised. To support and guide the healthy development of capital norms. It is necessary to uphold and improve the basic socialist economic system, unswervingly consolidate and develop the public economy, unswervingly encourage, support, and guide the development of the non-public economy, and promote the healthy development of the non-public economy and the healthy growth of people in the non-public economy."
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,Xi Jinping,"May 15, 2022","The third issue: correctly understand and grasp the supply guarantee of primary products. For a big country like ours, ensuring the supply of primary products is a major strategic issue. It is necessary to strengthen strategic planning and make early adjustments to ensure supply security."
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,Xi Jinping,"May 15, 2022","Saving must be a priority. “If you take something and use it sparingly, you will be rich; if you take something without control and use it improperly, you will be poor.” 5 It is necessary to implement a comprehensive conservation strategy and promote conservation actions in various fields. In the field of production, it is necessary to promote the comprehensive conservation, intensive and circular utilization of resources, reduce the energy consumption and material consumption per unit of product, speed up the technological transformation of the manufacturing industry, and improve the efficiency of input and output. In the field of consumption, it is necessary to enhance the consciousness of saving for the entire population, advocate a simple, moderate, green and low-carbon lifestyle, oppose extravagance, waste and excessive consumption, carry out in-depth food saving initiatives, such as the “Empty Plate” initiative, and extensively carry out the creation of green institutions, green families, green communities, green travel and other actions."
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,Xi Jinping,"May 15, 2022","It is necessary to enhance domestic resource production and security capabilities. It is necessary to intensify exploration efforts, implement a new round of strategic actions for ore prospecting breakthroughs, and improve the level of development and protection of marine resources and mineral resources. It is necessary to clarify the strategic bottom line of self-sufficiency in domestic production of important energy resources, give full play to the supporting role of state-owned enterprises, and accelerate the development and application of advanced extraction technologies for oil and gas and other resources. It is necessary to strengthen the construction of the national strategic material reserve system and play a role in regulating the bottom line at critical moments. It is necessary to promote garbage classification and recycling, expand the use of domestic solid waste, and speed up the construction of a waste recycling system."
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,Xi Jinping,"May 15, 2022","It is necessary to optimize the ability to guarantee overseas resources. It is necessary to make full use of both domestic and international markets and resources in a mutually beneficial and win-win manner, strengthen energy and resource cooperation with relevant countries on the premise of effectively preventing foreign investment risks, and expand the rights and interests of overseas high-quality resources."
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,Xi Jinping,"May 15, 2022","Here, I would like to emphasize the security of agricultural product supply. According to the latest land survey results, the area of arable land is still decreasing, and the basic farmland in some places does not grow food, fruit trees, or other high value-added crops. I have repeatedly said that Chinese people’s rice bowls should be firmly in their hands at all times, and our rice bowls should mainly contain Chinese grains. It is necessary to put the improvement of comprehensive agricultural production capacity in a more prominent position, continue to promote the construction of high-standard farmland, deeply implement the revitalization of the seed industry, improve the level of agricultural machinery and equipment, ensure the reasonable income of farmers who grow grain, ensure the absolute safety of grain rations and the basic self-sufficiency of grain, and improve the production and self-sufficiency of oil and soybeans."
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,Xi Jinping,"May 15, 2022","The fourth issue: correctly understand and grasp the prevention and resolution of major risks. Since the 1990s, China has effectively dealt with major challenges such as the Asian financial crisis, the international financial crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic. At present, there are many hidden risks in China’s economic and financial fields, but they are generally controllable. Stick to bottom-line thinking. The ancients said: “When disasters start to happen, you want to be like Du Qimeng.” We must give full play to the party’s leadership and the advantages of our socialist system in order to avoid large risks and crises."
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,Xi Jinping,"May 15, 2022","In the previous stage, we effectively dealt with shadow banking risks and Internet financial risks. At the same time, we must also see that new risks are still occurring, and the “black swan” and “gray rhino” incidents continue to occur. 6 There are several important reasons for analyzing these phenomena. One is the result of long-term accumulation. The impact of the “three-phase superposition” is not over yet, and the early risks still need to be digested. The second is regulatory capacity and institutional deficiencies. Serious oversight of corporate governance of financial institutions, and unsuitable financial supervision capabilities and levels. The management of local debts has been lax, and some localities have disguised and illegally borrowed, and the debt burden has continued to increase. The third is the barbaric behavior of the borrower. Some large enterprises are blindly impulsive, irrational diversification, excessive reliance on financial leverage, and excessive industrial capital entering the financial industry. Some shareholders and actual controllers operate and manage financial enterprises in violation of laws and regulations, with insider control, manipulation by major shareholders, financial fraud, and wanton misappropriation of funds. Fourth, collusion and corruption between officials and businessmen is rampant. The heads of some financial institutions and government officials are derelict of duty, corrupt, enriching their own pockets, and relying on the generosity of the country, resulting in heavy losses. Fifth, there are changes in the economic cycle. The slowdown in economic growth has brought to light all kinds of risks that were originally hidden, and the probability of local risks causing systemic risks has increased. Additionally, the risks characterized by corporate insolvency are prominent."
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,Xi Jinping,"May 15, 2022","In the next step, we must continue to follow the basic policy of stabilizing the overall situation, making plans, implementing policies by category, and do a good job in risk disposal. It is necessary to comply with laws and regulations, strengthen the construction of the financial rule of law, and explore the establishment of a regular law revision system. It is necessary to consolidate responsibilities with everyone “holding their own”, consolidate local party and government responsibilities, be responsible for territorial stability maintenance and defuse risks; consolidate the responsibilities of financial supervision, industry supervisors, discipline inspection and supervision departments, and promote risk resolution according to their respective responsibilities. We must also realize the main responsibility of enterprises for self-rescue, and formulate feasible risk resolution plans. It is necessary to strengthen capacity building, improve the level of regulatory technology, make up for regulatory shortcomings, and strengthen the construction of financial regulatory cadres. We must have sufficient resources, promptly set up a financial stability guarantee fund, give full play to the role of the deposit insurance system and guarantee funds in risk disposal, and study and formulate support policies for promoting mergers and acquisitions of financial institutions and resolving non-performing assets. Local governments should take the initiative to revitalize existing assets and defuse risks. Corporate shareholders must first bear the risk of loss until the share capital is cleared. It is necessary for all parties to cooperate extensively, and the financial industry should establish an integrated risk disposal mechanism, fully authorize, coordinate and improve the ability of cross-market and cross-industry coordination."
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,Xi Jinping,"May 15, 2022","Special attention should be paid to the risks of some real estate companies. All localities should earnestly take responsibility, strengthen supervision, keep a bottom line of no systemic risks, and maintain the stable and healthy development of the real estate market."
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,Xi Jinping,"May 15, 2022","The fifth issue: correct understanding and grasp of carbon neutralization. Promoting carbon neutrality is a major strategic decision made by the Party Central Committee after careful consideration. It is our solemn commitment to the international community and an inherent requirement for promoting high-quality development. Recently, some problems have arisen in practical work, some are engaged in “carbon charge”, some are engaged in “one size fits all”, sports “carbon reduction”, and even the phenomenon of “power cut off”, all of which do not meet the requirements of the Party Central Committee. Green and low-carbon development is a complex project and a long-term task for the comprehensive transformation of economic and social development. The adjustment of energy structure and industrial structure cannot be accomplished overnight, let alone divorced from reality. If the gradual withdrawal of traditional energy is not based on a safe and reliable alternative to new energy, it will have an impact on economic development and social stability. Pollution reduction and carbon reduction are an integral part of economic restructuring."
The Correct Understanding of Major Theoretical and Practical Problems of China’s Development,Xi Jinping,"May 15, 2022","At the ninth meeting of the Central Financial and Economic Commission, I made a comprehensive deployment of the “dual carbon” work, emphasizing that we must adhere to the principles of national overall planning, conservation priority, two-wheel drive, smooth internal and external, and risk prevention. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has issued opinions on the carbon neutralization work and approved the carbon peaking action plan. Achieving the goal of reaching the peak and carbon neutrality must be firm, but it cannot be accomplished in one go. To be based on national conditions, it is our basic national conditions to focus on coal, and the realization of carbon peaking must be based on this reality. While doing a good job in the clean and efficient utilization of coal, speed up the flexible transformation of coal-fired power units, develop renewable energy, promote the optimal combination of coal and new energy, and increase the consumption capacity of new energy. We must pay close attention to tackling key green and low-carbon technologies and accelerate the promotion and application of advanced technologies. It is necessary to conduct scientific assessments, improve the “dual control” system of energy consumption, create conditions to realize the transition from “dual control” of energy consumption to “dual control” 7 of total carbon emissions and intensity, and accelerate the formation of an incentive and restraint mechanism for reducing pollution and carbon emissions. Relevant departments in all regions should coordinate the work of “dual control” and “dual carbon” to prevent simple decomposition. To ensure energy supply, achieve multi-objective balance, and increase energy supply through multiple channels, large enterprises, especially state-owned enterprises, must take the lead in ensuring supply and stable prices, and will never allow major incidents such as large-scale “power outages” to occur again. It is necessary to further promote the energy revolution, promote energy consumption, supply, technology, and institutional reforms, strengthen international cooperation, and accelerate the construction of an energy powerhouse."

My parents were very strict with my studies. In addition, our parents also forced us out of the “greenhouse” to accept social tempering. During the Cultural Revolution, I went to live and work in a production team in rural northern Shaanxi, and my life was very hard. Once I visited my father in prison and complained about the hardships. I thought I would gain his sympathy. Unexpectedly, my father said that it was a good thing to live and work in a production team. He told that even though he was locked up, he did not want me rushing to come to see him when he was released. Instead, he insisted that I join the masses at the grassroots level!"
"To be an Ambitious Generation——An Interview with Xi Jinping, son of Xi Zhongxun",Xi Jinping,"Apr 15, 1997","In fact, I suffered more than the average person. During the Cultural Revolution, I went to prison four times. I was a “reactionary student,” and I was publicly shamed more than a dozen times. I was starved, and I was made a “beggar.” When I was 15 years old, I went to northern Shaanxi with “black materials” on my back, and I worked for seven years. Then, I grew from a “black five-category,” “mongrel,” and “reactionary student” to a League member and Party member, becoming the first secretary of the Party branch among the more than 27,000 Beijing-educated youths. In the rural areas of northern Shaanxi, I was a farmer and learned a full set of farm skills. I was one of the best laborers in the village. This experience has cultivated my will and self-confidence and made me feel that there is nothing in the world that is truly unbearable and that I can survive in the face of adversity. Now the conditions are much better than in the past, how can we not do well?"
"To be an Ambitious Generation——An Interview with Xi Jinping, son of Xi Zhongxun",Xi Jinping,"Apr 15, 1997","During that period of adversity, I also had the greatest opportunity to get to know the people at the grassroots level, forged a deep friendship with them, understood the joys, sorrows, and triumphs of the common people, and understood what reality is. I am doing my work now to oppose pretentiousness because I know that the common people are most disgusted with formalism."
"To be an Ambitious Generation——An Interview with Xi Jinping, son of Xi Zhongxun",Xi Jinping,"Apr 15, 1997","When it comes to being the child of a cadre, especially what should be paid attention to after entering politics, Xi Jinping said well:"
"To be an Ambitious Generation——An Interview with Xi Jinping, son of Xi Zhongxun",Xi Jinping,"Apr 15, 1997","First of all, I have to correct a concept. The children of cadres are not a class, but a model. Each has his or her own experiences, pursuits, and methods and moves through various trends. The current public opinion is biased toward the evaluation of the children of cadres. One saying is: “The dragon gives birth to the dragon, and the phoenix gives birth to the phoenix.” I think there is an old saying that goes well: “The dragon gives birth to nine sons, each of which is different.” It’s not like “a dragon gives birth to a dragon, a phoenix gives birth to a phoenix, and the son of a mouse burrows into the ground.” The key to who the children of cadres will become in the future depends on their acquired efforts and pursuits."
"To be an Ambitious Generation——An Interview with Xi Jinping, son of Xi Zhongxun",Xi Jinping,"Apr 15, 1997","As a son of a senior cadre, I think the most important thing is not to take the old roots of the father’s generation, but to rely on one’s own ability and not to have a sense of superiority. The father’s generation may have achieved great things, but the child is still an ordinary person and cannot engage in privileges. He must compete with others in a fair environment, be self-reliant, and stand on his own. As for what the cadre’s child can do, he can take on any profession. As long as he is a person who is beneficial to society, it is not a disgrace."

"Together, Let Us Fight COVID-19 and Create a Better Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 15th G20 Leaders’ Summit",Xi Jinping,"Nov 21, 2020","Dear Colleagues,"
"Together, Let Us Fight COVID-19 and Create a Better Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 15th G20 Leaders’ Summit",Xi Jinping,"Nov 21, 2020",I wish to begin by expressing heartfelt thanks to the Saudi Presidency and especially Your Majesty King Salman for the tremendous efforts in hosting this summit.
"Together, Let Us Fight COVID-19 and Create a Better Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 15th G20 Leaders’ Summit",Xi Jinping,"Nov 21, 2020","This outgoing year, humanity has experienced the most serious global pandemic in a century. Over one million people have lost their lives. The world economy is in recession. Societies and livelihoods are taking a big hit. The impact of COVID-19 is even worse than that of the 2008 global financial crisis."
"Together, Let Us Fight COVID-19 and Create a Better Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 15th G20 Leaders’ Summit",Xi Jinping,"Nov 21, 2020","The G20 has taken swift actions in the wake of COVID-19. At the Extraordinary Summit earlier this year, we agreed to step up cooperation to fight the pandemic. We agreed to advance the R&D of medicines and vaccines, maintain economic and financial stability, keep the industrial and supply chains open, and ease the debt burden of developing countries. These measures have given the world confidence and charted the course for international cooperation against the virus. In this global battle, the G20 has once again played an important and, indeed, irreplaceable role."
"Together, Let Us Fight COVID-19 and Create a Better Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 15th G20 Leaders’ Summit",Xi Jinping,"Nov 21, 2020","As we speak, the pandemic is still wreaking havoc across the world, and some countries face the threat of a second wave of infections. To contain the virus, stabilize the economy and protect livelihood remains a long and arduous journey for all countries. In the meantime, the international architecture is evolving at a faster pace. Rising unilateralism and protectionism are causing disruptions to global industrial and supply chains. While containing the virus on an ongoing basis, we must also stabilize and restore economic growth. For the G20, I believe more efforts are needed in the following areas:"
"Together, Let Us Fight COVID-19 and Create a Better Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 15th G20 Leaders’ Summit",Xi Jinping,"Nov 21, 2020","First, build a global firewall against COVID-19. We must first put the disease under control at home and, on that basis, strengthen exchanges and cooperation to help countries in need. Several G20 members have made progress in vaccine R&D and production. We should speed up action and support the WHO in mobilizing and consolidating resources and distributing vaccines fairly and efficiently. China actively supports and participates in international cooperation on COVID-19 vaccines. We have joined the COVAX facility and stand ready to step up cooperation with other countries on the R&D, production and distribution of vaccines. We will honor our commitment of giving assistance and support to other developing countries, and work to make vaccines a global public good accessible and affordable to people around the world."
"Together, Let Us Fight COVID-19 and Create a Better Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 15th G20 Leaders’ Summit",Xi Jinping,"Nov 21, 2020","Second, ensure the smooth functioning of the global economy. While containing the virus, we need to restore the secure and smooth operation of global industrial and supply chains. We need to reduce tariffs and barriers, and explore the liberalization of trade of key medical supplies. We need to further harmonize policies and standards and establish “fast tracks” to facilitate the orderly flow of personnel. China has proposed a global mechanism on the mutual recognition of health certificates based on nucleic acid test results in the form of internationally accepted QR codes. We hope more countries will join this mechanism. We also support the G20 in carrying out institutionalized cooperation and building global cooperation networks to facilitate the flow of personnel and goods."
"Together, Let Us Fight COVID-19 and Create a Better Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 15th G20 Leaders’ Summit",Xi Jinping,"Nov 21, 2020","Third, harness the role of the digital economy. COVID-19 has fueled the boom of new technologies, new business forms and new platforms such as 5G, artificial intelligence (AI) and smart cities, and accelerated the development of a contact-free economy like online shopping, online education and telemedicine. All this opens new pathways for economic growth. We ought to adapt to change and turn crisis into opportunity. We may deepen structural reform and cultivate new growth drivers through scientific and technological innovation and digital transformation. We could foster an enabling environment for the development of the digital economy, enhance data security cooperation, strengthen the digital infrastructure, and level the playing field for high-tech companies from all countries. Meanwhile, we need to address the challenges posed by the digital economy to employment, taxation and vulnerable groups, and seek to bridge the digital divide."
"Together, Let Us Fight COVID-19 and Create a Better Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 15th G20 Leaders’ Summit",Xi Jinping,"Nov 21, 2020","Fourth, pursue more inclusive development. We should keep our support for developing countries and help them overcome the hardships caused by the pandemic. In spite of its own difficulties, China has fully implemented the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) and put off debt repayment totaling over US$1.3 billion. China supports the decision on DSSI extension and will continue to work with other parties for its full implementation. Meanwhile, China will increase the level of debt suspension and relief for countries facing particular difficulties and encourage its financial institutions to provide new financing support on a voluntary basis and according to market principles. We should help women walk out of the shadow of the pandemic, address their special needs, and implement the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. China has proposed the convening of another Global Leaders’ Meeting on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment in 2025 to contribute to women’s development in the post-COVID era. It is also vital that we take the challenge of food security seriously and support the UN in holding the Food Systems Summit next year. In this connection, China proposes the holding of an international conference on food loss and waste in due course, and welcomes the active participation of G20 members and relevant international organizations."
"Together, Let Us Fight COVID-19 and Create a Better Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 15th G20 Leaders’ Summit",Xi Jinping,"Nov 21, 2020","Colleagues,"
"Together, Let Us Fight COVID-19 and Create a Better Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 15th G20 Leaders’ Summit",Xi Jinping,"Nov 21, 2020","The grave challenge of COVID-19 has exposed the deficiencies of global governance. The international community has a keen interest in the post-COVID international order and global governance as well as the future role for the G20. In my view, the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits should guide our way forward. We should uphold multilateralism, pursue openness and inclusiveness, promote mutually beneficial cooperation and keep pace with the times. The G20 ought to play a bigger role in this process."
"Together, Let Us Fight COVID-19 and Create a Better Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 15th G20 Leaders’ Summit",Xi Jinping,"Nov 21, 2020","First, we need to strengthen the UN-centered international system. The UN is the core institution for addressing international affairs through cooperation. All countries should firmly support the UN’s authority and standing, follow the purposes and principles of its Charter, and uphold the international order underpinned by international law. We support the UN in more effectively building global consensus, mobilizing global resources and coordinating global actions. We support a bigger role of the UN in promoting world peace and development."
"Together, Let Us Fight COVID-19 and Create a Better Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 15th G20 Leaders’ Summit",Xi Jinping,"Nov 21, 2020","Second, we need to improve the governance architecture for economic globalization. We should firmly safeguard the rules-based multilateral trading system that is transparent, nondiscriminatory, open and inclusive, and support the reform of the WTO to enhance its effectiveness and authority. We should promote free trade, oppose unilateralism and protectionism, uphold fair competition, and protect the development rights, interests and space of developing countries. We should continue the reform of the international financial system, conclude the IMF’s 16th General Quota Review on schedule, expand the role of the Special Drawing Rights, buttress the global financial safety net, and raise the representation and voice of developing countries. We should also address the challenges to economic globalization head-on, and make it more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial to all."
"Together, Let Us Fight COVID-19 and Create a Better Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 15th G20 Leaders’ Summit",Xi Jinping,"Nov 21, 2020","Third, we need to promote the sound development of the digital economy. To address countries’ concerns on data security, the digital divide, personal privacy and ethics, we should adopt people-centered and facts-based policies to encourage innovation and build trust. We should support the UN’s leadership role in this field, and work together to foster an open, fair, just and nondiscriminatory environment for building the digital economy. Recently, China launched the Global Initiative on Data Security. We may work on that basis and join other parties for discussing and formulating rules on global digital governance. China supports increased dialogue on AI, and proposes a meeting on this in due course to advance the G20 AI Principles and set the course for the healthy development of AI globally. The G20 also needs to discuss developing the standards and principles for central bank digital currencies with an open and accommodating attitude, and properly handle all types of risks and challenges while pushing collectively for the development of the international monetary system."
"Together, Let Us Fight COVID-19 and Create a Better Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 15th G20 Leaders’ Summit",Xi Jinping,"Nov 21, 2020","Fourth, we need to build up capacities for tackling global challenges. The most pressing task of the moment is to shore up the global public health system and contain COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. We need to enhance the role of the WHO, improve pandemic preparedness and response, forge a strong shield for human health and safety, and build a global community of health for all. We need to scale up international cooperation on ecology and environment to protect the planet Earth, our only homeland. We need to further curtail the production and use of non-essential, disposable plastic goods. COP26 of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and COP15 of the Convention on Biological Diversity, both to be held next year, may serve as opportunities for forging broader consensus and stronger synergy in building a clean and beautiful world where man and nature coexist in harmony. China calls for a complete ban on illegal trade of wildlife and for stronger exchanges and cooperation on the protection of wild fauna and flora."
"Together, Let Us Fight COVID-19 and Create a Better Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 15th G20 Leaders’ Summit",Xi Jinping,"Nov 21, 2020","Colleagues,"
"Together, Let Us Fight COVID-19 and Create a Better Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 15th G20 Leaders’ Summit",Xi Jinping,"Nov 21, 2020","Building on its major strategic gains in fighting COVID-19, China has made steady strides in economic development. The recently concluded Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee adopted recommendations for formulating China’s 14th five-year plan. The plenum underscored that China will finish building a moderately prosperous society in all respects within the set time frame, and will embark on a new journey next year toward fully building a modern socialist country. Based on a scientific analysis of the new stage of China’s development, we will stay committed to the new development philosophy, and actively foster a new development paradigm with domestic circulation as the mainstay and domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other. This new development paradigm is by no means a closed-door policy. Instead, it urges efforts on both the supply and demand sides to ensure unimpeded flow in production, distribution, exchange and consumption. While making the Chinese economy more resilient and competitive, it also aims to build a new system of open economy of higher standards. This will create more opportunities for the world to benefit from China’s high-quality development."
"Together, Let Us Fight COVID-19 and Create a Better Future – Remarks by Xi Jinping at Session I of the 15th G20 Leaders’ Summit",Xi Jinping,"Nov 21, 2020","China will always be a builder of global peace, a contributor to global development and a defender of international order. On the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit, China stands ready to pursue peaceful coexistence and common development with all countries. We may bridge differences through dialogue, resolve disputes through negotiation, and make a joint effort for world peace and development."

Working Together for an Asia-Pacific Community with a Shared Future: Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 27th APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting,Xi Jinping,"Nov 20, 2020","Dear Colleagues,"
Working Together for an Asia-Pacific Community with a Shared Future: Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 27th APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting,Xi Jinping,"Nov 20, 2020",It gives me great pleasure to join you via video link. I wish to thank Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin and the Malaysian government for hosting the meeting.
Working Together for an Asia-Pacific Community with a Shared Future: Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 27th APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting,Xi Jinping,"Nov 20, 2020",The past 30-plus years since the inception of APEC has seen rapid evolution of the international landscape and profound transformation of global governance. It has also witnessed a sea change in the Asia-Pacific region.
Working Together for an Asia-Pacific Community with a Shared Future: Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 27th APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting,Xi Jinping,"Nov 20, 2020","Over the past three decades and more, APEC cooperation has kept deepening and made substantial progress on many fronts. Guided by the Bogor Goals, we have steadily enhanced regional economic integration. We have advanced trade and investment liberalization and facilitation in tandem with economic and technical cooperation, with a view to realizing mutual complementarity and balanced development of the “two wheels” of APEC cooperation. We have advocated open regionalism and developed an APEC approach of voluntarism, consensus-building, flexibility, pragmatism and incremental progress. Over the years, the Asia-Pacific has weathered two financial crises and lifted over one billion people out of poverty. It has become a leading and most dynamic powerhouse of the global economy, playing an active role in building an open world economy, upholding the multilateral trading system, and spearheading economic globalization."
Working Together for an Asia-Pacific Community with a Shared Future: Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 27th APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting,Xi Jinping,"Nov 20, 2020","Three decades on, both the world and the Asia-Pacific are experiencing profound changes, a process further accelerated by COVID-19. The world economy is in the doldrums. Economic globalization is encountering headwinds. Unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise. Balancing equity and efficiency, growth and distribution, and technology and employment is getting more difficult. The wealth gap remains a common sight. The global governance system faces new challenges. For the first time in decades, the Asia-Pacific as a whole registered negative economic growth. Protecting people’s health and reviving the economy are two formidable tasks we have to take on. Where should Asia-Pacific cooperation be heading? The answer bears on the development of our region, the well-being of our people, and the future of the world at large."
Working Together for an Asia-Pacific Community with a Shared Future: Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 27th APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting,Xi Jinping,"Nov 20, 2020","One priority on this year’s APEC agenda is to unveil the post-2020 vision, a pathway toward our goal of building an Asia-Pacific community. This should be taken as a new starting point for us to begin another phase in Asia-Pacific cooperation, sustain the strong momentum of development in our region, and embrace a future of shared prosperity. Together, we can build an Asia-Pacific community with a shared future featuring openness and inclusiveness, innovation-driven growth, greater connectivity, and mutually beneficial cooperation."
Working Together for an Asia-Pacific Community with a Shared Future: Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 27th APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting,Xi Jinping,"Nov 20, 2020","First, we need to stay open and inclusive. The world economy is like the Pacific Ocean around us — It admits water from various rivers, and connects different parts of the world. As such, it has acquired a vast magnitude and enormous vitality. The approach of pursuing cooperation as equals and resolving differences with mutual respect is what essentially makes economic development and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific possible. Throughout the years, APEC has committed itself to deepening regional economic integration and made significant progress in implementing the Bogor Goals. It has also played an important role in steering the evolution of the multilateral trading system. Yet it must be noted that free and open trade and investment cannot be achieved overnight. It is important that the Asia-Pacific should remain the bellwether in safeguarding peace and stability, upholding multilateralism, and fostering an open world economy. We must stay as determined as ever to support the multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization at its core, promote free and open trade and investment, and make economic globalization more open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial to all. Continued efforts are needed to press ahead with regional economic integration for the early realization of a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP). China welcomes the signing of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and will favorably consider joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). As we continue to work on free and open trade, we should pay no less attention to economic and technical cooperation. We need to further implement the APEC Strategy for Strengthening Quality Growth and the Action Agenda on Advancing Inclusion, and accommodate the concerns of developing members. We need to address in particular the special needs of women and some other communities, and support micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). Such efforts will contribute to inclusive and sustainable growth. China will host a seminar on advancing economic inclusion through trade and investment to look for suggestions on how trade and investment policies could deliver broader benefits to people. China looks forward to working with all parties to follow up on those suggestions."
Working Together for an Asia-Pacific Community with a Shared Future: Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 27th APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting,Xi Jinping,"Nov 20, 2020","Second, we need to pursue innovation-driven growth. The digital economy represents the future direction of global development, while innovation has fueled the economic takeoff of the Asia-Pacific. We need to proactively seize the opportunities of our times and fully harness our region’s abundant human resources, solid technological foundation, and enormous market potential to gain a new competitive edge and open up new possibilities for the betterment of our people’s lives. The APEC Internet and Digital Economy Roadmap should be implemented in full to spur the dissemination and application of new technologies, strengthen digital infrastructure, and close the digital divide. We need to improve economic governance and foster an open, fair, equitable and non-discriminatory environment for businesses. This year, China has conducted an APEC case study on smart cities, which we hope will contribute to the formulation of guidelines on smart cities and offer an example for innovative urban development across the region. China calls for experience sharing among APEC members on how to control COVID-19 and achieve economic recovery with digital technologies. China also calls for improving the doing-digital-business environment, energizing market players, and tapping the potential of the digital economy. Such efforts will bring fresh impetus to economic recovery in our region. Next year, China will host a workshop on digital technology-enabled poverty alleviation, in a bid to unleash the role of digital technologies in eradicating poverty in our region."
Working Together for an Asia-Pacific Community with a Shared Future: Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 27th APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting,Xi Jinping,"Nov 20, 2020","Third, we need to enhance connectivity. Connectivity is a vital basis of regional economic integration and an essential underpinning for interconnected development of the world. The ongoing pandemic further highlights the importance of connectivity. We need to continue to implement the APEC Connectivity Blueprint to facilitate the smooth, safe and orderly flow of people, goods, capital and data and achieve a seamlessly connected Asia-Pacific. China has opened “fast tracks” with fellow APEC members like Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, and Singapore to facilitate the movement of people during the pandemic, and more will be done to complete a network of such arrangements. In this connection, it is important to promote the mutual recognition of the COVID-related health information of international travelers. China is ready to take active and well-thought-out steps with all other parties to set up “green lanes”, which will help make customs clearance more efficient, unclog bottlenecks, and reconnect disrupted links. We may also promote the creation of international cooperation platforms on industrial and supply chains to ensure the safe and smooth operation of industrial and supply chains in our region and beyond. We need to pursue greater complementarity among the development plans and connectivity initiatives of different parties to forge a bigger synergy. On China’s part, we hope to work with all partners in high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, which we believe will set up a bigger platform for connectivity in the Asia-Pacific and inject a stronger impetus into the economy of our region and the wider world."
Working Together for an Asia-Pacific Community with a Shared Future: Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 27th APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting,Xi Jinping,"Nov 20, 2020","Fourth, we need to promote mutually beneficial cooperation. The Asia-Pacific economies have a high degree of mutual complementarity and enjoy deeply intertwined interests. Our economic cooperation has never been a zero-sum political game in which one gains at the expense of the other. Rather, our cooperation has provided us with a development platform to ensure what we each do can be mutually reinforcing and beneficial to all. There is a Malay proverb that goes, “bukit sama didaki, lurah sama dituruni”, which means to climb the hill together and go down the ravine together. It aptly captures the spirit of our Asia-Pacific family. COVID-19 serves as another reminder that only solidarity and cooperation can enable us to prevail over challenges. We need to deepen the Asia-Pacific partnership featuring mutual trust, inclusiveness and mutually beneficial cooperation and follow the approach of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits. We need to keep raising the level and scope of our regional cooperation to achieve shared prosperity for the whole region. It is important that we advance practical cooperation on the basis of consensus, properly manage differences and disagreements, and keep Asia-Pacific cooperation in the right direction to ensure APEC’s sound development in the long run."
Working Together for an Asia-Pacific Community with a Shared Future: Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 27th APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting,Xi Jinping,"Nov 20, 2020","At this very moment, fighting COVID-19 is the most pressing task for us all. We must step up research and development of vaccines and related exchanges, and work harder to make the vaccines a global public good to improve their accessibility and affordability in developing countries. For that purpose, China has joined the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility (COVAX). We support APEC in strengthening policy exchanges and capacity building in the areas of public health and MSMEs. China has made a telemedicine initiative to give people in poor and remote areas access to timely and quality medical services. We hope these efforts will contribute to anti-epidemic cooperation and economic recovery."
Working Together for an Asia-Pacific Community with a Shared Future: Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 27th APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting,Xi Jinping,"Nov 20, 2020","China highly values the role of APEC. We will continue to support the organization’s development, and with our root struck deep in the Asia-Pacific, we will continue to serve its development and prosperity."

Working Together for an Asia-Pacific Community with a Shared Future: Remarks by Xi Jinping at the 27th APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting,Xi Jinping,"Nov 20, 2020","This year, the Chinese people have exerted strenuous efforts to score a major strategic achievement in controlling COVID-19. Working with other countries in these trying times, China has contributed its wisdom and resources to the global fight against the coronavirus. It has shared with various parties full experience on containment and treatment and done its best to assist other countries and international organizations. All these are among the concrete actions we have taken toward building a global community of health for all. At the same time, we have coordinated COVID-19 control with economic and social development at home, and scaled up macro policy response so that the Chinese economy could stabilize, pick up, and steadily upgrade. In the first three quarters of this year, China’s GDP grew by 0.7 percent, on course to register positive growth for the whole year. It is also worth noting that by the end of this year, we will have lifted out of poverty all rural residents living below the current poverty line."

The most serious pandemic in a century is still wreaking havoc. To clinch an early victory against COVID-19 and restore economic growth remains the top priority for the international community. G20 members need to shoulder responsibilities in global cooperation against the virus. In the meantime, we need to draw on experience both positive and otherwise, and lose no time in remedying deficiencies, closing loopholes and strengthening weak links in a bid to enhance preparedness and capacity for coping with major public health emergencies. Here, I want to make five points on what we need to do."
Working Together to Build a Global Community of Health for All – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Global Health Summit,Xi Jinping,"May 21, 2021","First, we must put people and their lives first. The battle with COVID-19 is one for the people and by the people. What has happened proves that to completely defeat the virus, we must put people’s lives and health front and center, demonstrate a great sense of political responsibility and courage, and make extraordinary responses to an extraordinary challenge. No effort must be spared to attend every case, save every patient, and truly respect the value and dignity of every human life. Meanwhile, it is also important to minimize the potential impact on people’s life and maintain general order in our society."
Working Together to Build a Global Community of Health for All – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Global Health Summit,Xi Jinping,"May 21, 2021","Second, we must follow science-based policies and ensure a coordinated and systemic response. Faced with this new infectious disease, we should advocate the spirit of science, adopt a science-based approach, and follow the law of science. The fight against COVID-19 is an all-out war that calls for a systemic response to coordinate pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, balance targeted routine COVID-19 protocols and emergency measures, and ensure both epidemic control and socio-economic development. G20 members need to adopt responsible macro-economic policies and step up coordination to keep the global industrial and supply chains safe and smooth. It is essential to give continued support by such means as debt suspension and development aid to developing countries, especially vulnerable countries facing exceptional difficulties."
Working Together to Build a Global Community of Health for All – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Global Health Summit,Xi Jinping,"May 21, 2021","Third, we must stick together and promote solidarity and cooperation. The pandemic is yet another reminder that we as humanity rise and fall together with a shared future. Confronted by a pandemic like COVID-19, we must champion the vision of building a global community of health for all, tide over this trying time through solidarity and cooperation, and firmly reject any attempt to politicize, label or stigmatize the virus. Political manipulation would not serve COVID-19 response on the domestic front. It would only disrupt international cooperation against the virus and bring greater harm to people around the world."
Working Together to Build a Global Community of Health for All – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Global Health Summit,Xi Jinping,"May 21, 2021","Fourth, we must uphold fairness and equity as we strive to close the immunization gap. A year ago, I proposed that vaccines should be made a global public good. Today, the problem of uneven vaccination has become more acute. It is imperative for us to reject vaccine nationalism and find solutions to issues concerning the production capacity and distribution of vaccines, in order to make vaccines more accessible and affordable in developing countries. Major vaccine-developing and producing countries need to take up their responsibility to provide more vaccines to developing countries in urgent need, and they also need to support their businesses in joint research and authorized production with other countries having the relevant capacity. Multilateral financial institutions should provide inclusive financing support for vaccine procurement of developing countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) should speed up efforts under the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) facility."
Working Together to Build a Global Community of Health for All – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Global Health Summit,Xi Jinping,"May 21, 2021","Fifth, we must address both the symptoms and root causes as we improve the governance system. The pandemic is an extensive test of the global health governance system. It is important that we strengthen and leverage the role of the UN and the WHO and improve the global disease prevention and control system to better prevent and respond to future pandemics. It is important that we uphold the spirit of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, fully heed the views of developing countries, and better reflect their legitimate concerns. It is also important that we enhance our capacity of monitoring, early-warning and emergency response, our capacity of treatment of major pandemics, of contingency reserve and logistics, of fighting disinformation, and of providing support to developing countries."

Working Together to Build a Global Community of Health for All – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Global Health Summit,Xi Jinping,"May 21, 2021","In this unprecedented battle against the pandemic, China has, while receiving support and help from many countries, mounted a massive global humanitarian operation. At the 73rd World Health Assembly held in May last year, I announced five measures that China would take to support global anti-pandemic cooperation. Implementation of those measures is well underway. Notwithstanding the limited production capacity and enormous demand at home, China has honored its commitment by providing free vaccines to more than 80 developing countries in urgent need and exporting vaccines to 43 countries. We have provided 2 billion US dollars in assistance for the COVID-19 response and economic and social recovery in developing countries hit by the pandemic. We have sent medical supplies to more than 150 countries and 13 international organizations, providing more than 280 billion masks, 3.4 billion protective suits and 4 billion testing kits to the world. A cooperation mechanism has been established for Chinese hospitals to pair up with 41 African hospitals, and construction for the China-assisted project of the Africa CDC headquarters officially started at the end of last year. Important progress has also been made in the China-UN joint project to set up in China a global humanitarian response depot and hub. China is fully implementing the G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative for Poorest Countries and has so far put off debt repayment exceeding 1.3 billion US dollars, the highest deferral amount among G20 members."

Working Together to Build a Global Community of Health for All – Remarks by Xi Jinping at the Global Health Summit,Xi Jinping,"May 21, 2021","The ancient Roman philosopher Seneca said, “We are all waves of the same sea.” Let us join hands and stand shoulder to shoulder with each other to firmly advance international cooperation against COVID-19, build a global community of health for all, and work for a healthier and brighter future for humanity."
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,Xi Jinping,"Mar 2, 1993","The key to implementing the spirit of the Party’s 14th National Congress, accelerating economic construction, and deepening reform and opening up lies in leadership. As for how to excel in leadership in the new situation, leading cadres at the grass-roots level have raised many questions. Recently, we brought these questions before Comrade Xi Jinping, Secretary of the Fuzhou Municipal Party Committee."
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,Xi Jinping,"Mar 2, 1993","Question: In your opinion, what new leadership concepts should be established in a socialist market economic system? What old leadership concepts and methods should be changed?"
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,Xi Jinping,"Mar 2, 1993","A: To excel in the grand socialist market economy, for leading cadres at all levels, it is not only necessary to deeply understand the great significance of developing a socialist market economy, but also to reform ideas, earnestly grasp the operating laws and requirements of the socialist market economy, deeply understand and familiarize oneself with the market, and constantly enhance market awareness. This specifically includes establishing the concept of market-oriented decision-making, daring to be the first in the world, daring to break past old rules and regulations, and daring to tear down barriers. We must establish the concept of talent-based competition, boldly select, actively cultivate, and strive to introduce all kinds of talents who have both ability and political integrity and who have the courage and knowledge to adapt to the needs of market economic development. We must also establish and strengthen new leadership concepts, break through the shackles of backward traditional concepts and subjective prejudices, and change old leadership concepts and styles of leadership. This mainly means breaking past the misconception that the development of the commodity economy and the market economy be regarded as “deviant” and thereby further emancipating minds."
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,Xi Jinping,"Mar 2, 1993","In terms of leadership, it is necessary to break through administrative monopolies, decentralize power to the market and enterprises, abandon “power interception,” and “release the waters to attract more fish,” which is the primary task of establishing a market economic system. To this end, our leaders must liberate themselves from the old executive orders and the awareness of superiors, let enterprises “play the leading role” in the market economy, focus government functions on macro-control, formulate market economic rules, promote fair competition, solve problems for enterprises, and guide the healthy development of the economy."
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,Xi Jinping,"Mar 2, 1993",Q: What should be the most important qualities of a leader in this new situation?
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,Xi Jinping,"Mar 2, 1993","A: I think that under the new situation of reform and opening up, in addition to requiring leaders to have the basic qualities of emancipating their minds and seeking truth from facts, the most important thing is to be creative. Only creative leaders can excel at leading reforms, promoting reforms, and making work dynamic, vigorous, enterprising, and effective."
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,Xi Jinping,"Mar 2, 1993","To be creative, we must first establish firm beliefs. If a leader is bewildered by the temporary low tide of the international communist movement and loses confidence in building a strong socialist country with Chinese characteristics with pessimism and disappointment, what kind of creativity is there? Second, you must be courageous and knowledgeable. In the tide of reform and opening up, a leader must be filled with the spirit of “breakthrough,” must dare to experiment, dare to break through boldly, and dare to blaze new paths and begin new careers. This is manifested in work that is instilled with a strong sense of progress and leaders that excel at grasping opportunities, possess unique insights, and have the sensitivity to understand the situation and predict prospects. It is manifested in leaders that dare to think and do the work, grasp it accurately, securely, and practically, and are able to achieve outstanding work performance on this difficult and tortuous road. Third, we must master the “two ends.” The first is orders from above. Leaders must have a profound understanding of the guidelines, lines, and policies of the central and provincial party committees. The second is the lay of the land. Leaders must accurately understand the actual situation of the region, the local government, and the will of the masses. Only by organically combining the two can we work creatively in practice."
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,Xi Jinping,"Mar 2, 1993","Q: In accelerating reform, opening up, and modernization, what is the most important aspect of making good leadership decisions?"
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,Xi Jinping,"Mar 2, 1993","A: To make leadership decisions, first of all, we must adhere to the scientific nature of decision-making, act in accordance with the objective laws of social and economic development, be truth-seeking and pragmatic, and proceed from reality. This is the most important aspect of current leadership decision-making. In the process of reform, opening up, and modernization, due to the different conditions in different places, development has not been balanced. This requires us to proceed from local realities, to adhere to a positive and realistic attitude, and to constantly grasp the changing economic development conditions and trends. We must seize every opportunity to promote and advance the extraordinary and high-speed development of the economy."
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,Xi Jinping,"Mar 2, 1993","Second, we must adhere to the democratic nature of decision-making. The essence of socialist leadership is to seek the interests of the broad masses of the people. Therefore, leaders must always take the idea of seeking benefits for the people and keeping in close contact with the masses as the fundamental ideology of decision-making. This requires us to implement broad democracy in decision-making, to adhere to the ideological line of coming from the masses and going to the masses, to listen carefully to the opinions of the masses, and to excel at concentrating the wisdom of the masses. During the years I worked in Fuzhou, I gradually formed a set of effective working methods: The first was to carry out large-scale city-wide work methodology research activities for three consecutive years, allowing cadres and the masses to review the implementation of various work and practical affairs of the municipal party committee and government in the previous year and to put forward work suggestions for the new year. The second was to carry out on-site office meeting activities at the grassroots level to keep abreast of the real situation of the counties (cities), districts, and departments and to help resolve practical problems in a timely manner at the grassroots level. The third was to carry out the activities of leading cadres to jointly visit the masses. The leaders gained direct face-to-face, heart-to-heart experiences with the masses to exchange ideas, listen to the voices of the masses, understand the sufferings of the masses, and resolve the problems of the masses in a timely manner."
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,Xi Jinping,"Mar 2, 1993","Q: In the current situation where there is much work to be done, what should be the most important work for leaders?"
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,Xi Jinping,"Mar 2, 1993","A: The tasks before us are indeed burdensome and arduous. In this case, I believe that leaders must be good at seeing the big picture. Rather than trying to attend to big and small matters as one who grasps the eyebrows and the beard all at once, in order to think about, plan, and seize big things, a leader’s main energy must be devoted to the overall, directional, and key issues. In recent years, our municipal party committee has paid more attention to getting rid of the entanglement of affairs, focusing on the overall situation, concentrating on and doing a good job of some major events that can affect and drive the overall situation, thereby winning the initiative in our work. For example, in this past period, we organized a special team to study and formulate the Strategic Vision for Fuzhou City’s 20-Year Economic and Social Development. The strategic goals, priorities, and measures for the future development of our city were put forward, formulating a programmatic document to guide the city’s work. Under the strategic guidance of the city’s economic and social development, the key to developing an export-oriented economy is to do a good job in attracting investment, play our “cards” and “billiards,” and continuously expand the scale and field of foreign capital utilization. Adjust the economic structure, mainly to optimize primary industries, adjust secondary industries, vigorously develop tertiary industries, and promote the rapid and healthy development of the national economy. In urban construction, we must focus on the renovation of old cities and create a good social environment for reform and opening up. Because of clear goals and a prominent focus, positive factors were effectively mobilized in all aspects, forming an absolute advantage in solving problems as a whole."
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,Xi Jinping,"Mar 2, 1993",Q: Fuzhou has made remarkable achievements in the renovation of the old city. What has been the overall experience in terms of leadership?
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,Xi Jinping,"Mar 2, 1993","A: Since the reform and opening up, especially in recent years, Fuzhou has carried out multi-channel, multi-form, and multi-level renovation of the old city, already renovating more than half of the area. This has greatly improved the urban investment environment and the living conditions of citizens, both of which are remarkable results. From the perspective of leadership decision-making, the key has been to seize the great opportunity of reform and opening up to give full play to the role of Fuzhou as a capital city, a central city, and a historical and cultural city, using the geographical advantage of being close to Hong Kong and Taiwan to emancipate the mind. This boldly and decisively combines the urgent desire of the general public to improve our living environment with the requirements of the times to transform, build, and beautify the city, so that they complement each other and achieve the best of both worlds. Specifically, there are the following four aspects. The first is to strengthen leadership and unify planning. The renovation of the old city should be listed as an important task in economic construction, and we should work closely with one another to strengthen the organization, planning, policies, and management so that the renovation of the old city can develop in a comprehensive, complete, and healthy way. The second is to emancipate the mind and actively explore. We must boldly innovate, dare to venture, dare to take risks, dare to try, and take an unconventional and leaping development path so that the transformation of the old city will continue to develop in depth and breadth. The third is to introduce foreign capital to advance and formulate preferential policies to encourage foreign businessmen to participate in the renovation of the old city. Currently, our foreign participation rate is over 50%. The fourth is to believe in the masses and rely on the masses, firmly establish a sense of responsibility and mission for the benefit of the people, follow the path of the masses, consider and take care of the legitimate interests of the masses, and gain the care, understanding, support, and participation of the masses, so that the renovation of the old city can proceed smoothly."
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,Xi Jinping,"Mar 2, 1993",Q: How can young leading cadres do their jobs well under the new situation?
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,Xi Jinping,"Mar 2, 1993","A: The new situation of reform and opening up has put forward new tasks and new requirements for young leading cadres. In order to adapt to such a situation and successfully complete the work assigned by the Party and the people, we must pay attention to the following relationships:"
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,Xi Jinping,"Mar 2, 1993","The first is the relationship between heritage and innovation. The development of the economy and culture is a matter of heritage. Young leading cadres should not deny or abandon the achievements of their predecessors, but should rather humbly learn from their elder comrades, constantly enrich and improve themselves, and continue to develop on this basis, making innovations within this heritage, spur reform and opening up and economic construction to a new stage in innovation, and enhance leadership ability in innovation. Only in this way can the continuity and stability of leadership work be maintained."
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,Xi Jinping,"Mar 2, 1993","The second is the relationship between power and duty. In particular, young leading cadres should establish the idea that “leadership is service” and strengthen their awareness of public servants. It should be clearly recognized that the power of leaders is endowed by the Party and the people and can only be used for the people rather than for personal gain. Become a leader with “great power that does not forget the heavy responsibility and respect and that does not forget one’s core of public servitude,” unite power with responsibility and service, and maintain and utilize power well to serve the people."
Xi Jinping Discusses Leadership,Xi Jinping,"Mar 2, 1993","The third is to adhere to the relationship between collective leadership and daring to be responsible. With the deepening of reform and opening up, the tasks faced are becoming more and more arduous, and the situation is becoming more and more complicated. The knowledge and ability of leaders alone cannot resolve these issues. We must concentrate everyone’s wisdom, work together, and succeed. This requires young leading cadres to conscientiously adhere to and improve the collective leadership system, establish and implement a scientific division of labor and responsibility, give full play to the role of each and every team member, and prevent individuals from having the final say. At the same time, young leading cadres must have the spirit of being highly responsible to the Party and the people, and at the critical moment when they must make decisions, they must stand up, have the courage to take responsibility, and dare to make decisions."
